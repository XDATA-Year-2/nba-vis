 THE FACT:   Kyle Lowry  had a team-high 21 points and nine assists. Lowry has dished nine or more dimes in four of the last five games. 
 
 THE LEAD:  The Toronto Raptors (17-17) continued their winning ways, defeating the Detroit Pistons (14-22) 112-91 at Air Canada Centre on Wednesday night. The Raptors have now won eight of their last nine games against sub .500 teams. Both teams shot poorly from the field. The Raptors connected on 40.7 percent of their shots, while the Pistons shot 39.5 percent. However, the Raptors made 31 of their 34 free throws and 11 of their 3-point attempts. The Raptors balanced attack was led by Lowry's 21 points and 9 assists and a pair of double-doubles with  Jonas Valanciunas'  16 points and 11 rebounds and  Amir Johnson's  10 points and 11 rebounds. The Pistons have now lost six in a row.  Brandon Jennings  game-high 22 points and nine assists was tops for Detroit.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We knew it was going to be a grind out game and that's something we're learning to do quarter by quarter, possession by possession, but our defensive intensity is what changed the game starting in the second half." 
 -- Raptors Head Coach  Dwane Casey  on what changed the game. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Points off turnovers: The Pistons gave away the ball 16 times, more importantly, those turnovers led to 25 points. The Raptors were able to capitalize on the poor care of the ball forcing turnovers into baskets.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Pistons took a 54-50 lead into halftime, but came out flat after the break with the Raptors starting the third quarter on a 17-4 run, pushing the score to 67-58. While the Pistons threatened, they never came within two or took the lead for the second half. The Raptors outscored the Pistons 62-37 in the second half.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We can't have those first halves where teams get out on us. We have to jump on teams, we can't let them hit us first we have to play with that energy that we did in the third quarter." 
 -- Raptors forward Johnson on bouncing back in the second half. 
 
 
 NOT:  DeRozan and Johnson were ice cold in the first half for the Raptors shooting 0-for-7 and 0-for-9 from the field respectively. Johnson shot 0-for-7 in the previous game against the Pacers, yet finished the second half 4-for-6 versus the Pistons. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Pistons rookie  Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  started the game shooting 6-for-7 for 13 points in the first half, yet sat for much of the third quarter when the Raptors made their run.  
 
 NOTABLE:  Pistons guard  Rodney Stuckey  returned to the lineup after missing three games with a right shoulder injury; he scored 14 points off the bench. Raptors forward  Tyler Hansbrough  was unavailable due to a sprained left ankle. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Raptors, Saturday vs. Nets, Monday vs. Bucks and Wednesday @ Celtics. For the Pistons, Friday @ 76ers, Saturday vs. Suns and Friday vs. Jazz.
