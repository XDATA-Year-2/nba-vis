 THE FACT:  Houston Rockets guard  James Harden  is the first Rocket to score at least 37 points in three consecutive games since  Hakeem Olajuwon  in 1994-95. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Harden scored 38 points on 14-for-23 shooting and recorded a season-high five steals to lead the Rockets past the Los Angeles Lakers 113-99 Wednesday at Toyota Center.   Dwight Howard  (20 points, 13 rebounds, four steals) and  Terrence Jones  (15 points, 13 rebounds) each posted double-doubles for Houston (23-13), which has won four of its last five home games.  
 
 Pau Gasol  paced L.A. (14-22), which has lost nine of ten overall, with 21 points on 8-for-13 shooting and 12 rebounds.  Nick Young  chipped in 25 points and six boards off the bench. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Everybody was being aggressive [in the second half]. I just kind of played back and tried to get everybody involved." --  James  Harden 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Rockets, who improved to 14-2 this season when limiting their opponent to less than 100 points, have overcome a double-digit deficit in each of their last seven victories over the Lakers. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  L.A. controlled the game for a majority of the first two quarters, but it could not survive an avalanche of turnovers and poor defense against the pick-and-roll in the third. With Harden in particular wreaking havoc, netting 17 points on 7-for-10 shooting, the Lakers watched their 57-52 halftime lead quickly turn into an 85-72 deficit. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "In the third quarter, I was just trying to play defense and then get out of the way on offense. [Harden] just carried us. ... I've seen him do this, just maybe not that consistently or that many times in a row." --  Houston guard  Jeremy Lin 
 
 
 HOT:  The All-Star duo of Harden and Howard combined to collect nine of Houston's 12 steals, as both players set individual season highs in thefts. 
 
 NOT:  The Lakers connected on only 33.3 percent (6-for-18) of their field goal attempts and committed seven turnovers that led to ten Houston points during the third quarter. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "Our turnovers are killing us. We're just not taking care of the ball. We get slow. We get methodical. We get stuck in the mud in the second half, and we've got to do a better job." --  Lakers coach  Mike D'Antoni 
 
 
 NOT II:  Howard has shot a dismal 37.5 percent (15-for-40) at the free-throw line in two meetings against the Lakers -- his former team -- this season. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Rockets' offense appeared far too stagnant in the opening half, but Houston began to rely heavily on the pick-and-roll to get its offense flowing in the second half. After recording only five assists before halftime, the Rockets dished out seven dimes and shot 13-for-23 (56.5 percent) in the third period. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Houston's  Chandler Parsons  (sore right knee) and  Greg Smith  (sore right knee) did not play, and the pair are listed as day-to-day moving forward. Eighth-year veteran  Ronnie Brewer  made his first start of the season in place of Parsons. ... Rockets starting point guard  Patrick Beverley  (right hand fracture) took part in some shooting drills during Wednesday morning's shootaround, and he said he expects to return to action with a healed right hand sooner than the original diagnosis of four to six weeks. Beverley has not played since Dec. 21, the evening he suffered the injury during a win at Detroit. ... Houston improved to 3-6 this season against Pacific Division foes. ... The Rockets have shot 42-for-160 (26.3 percent) from 3-point range over their last six games. ... Houston is now 19-3 when leading after three quarters. ... L.A. has allowed at least 100 points in 14 of its last 17 road contests. ... Young has scored at least 20 points in nine of his last 13 outings. ... The Lakers' bench has outscored the opponent's reserves in 27 of 36 games this season. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Lakers: Friday @ L.A. Clippers, Tuesday vs. Cleveland, Wednesday @ Phoenix. For the Rockets: Friday @ Atlanta, Saturday @ Washington, Monday @ Boston.
