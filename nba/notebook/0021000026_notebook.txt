Michael Beasley  scored 21 points and grabbed 10 rebounds and  Kevin Love  scored 17 and grabbed 16 to lead a surprisingly athletic and aggressive Minnesota team. QUOTABLE:  "They have beat us three times in a very short period of time. You have to give them credit. They totally outplayed us pretty much every minute when played them in these three games. We're not the type of team that can get outplayed and come back and win."   -- Milwaukee coach Scott Skiles on tonight's game and the two preseason meetings between Minnesota and Milwaukee. THE STAT:  Minnesota wins because of their 'hustle stats.' Wolves 74 total rebounds, Bucks 50. Wolves 20 offensive rebounds, Bucks nine. Wolves 11 blocks, Bucks eight. Wolves eight steals, Bucks four. TURNING POINT:  After leading by as many as 17 in the third quarter and seeing Milwaukee get within six with 9:52 to play, Minnesota clamped down on defense and got a number of key offensive rebounds and built a 16-point lead on their way to a 11-point victory. QUOTABLE II:  "We're not thinking about last year. This is a new year, new season, new team. We're going to keep fighting. ... We knew they we going to make a run; they're a good team. To be able to hold them off and come out and get some points and some stops [at the end of the game]. That's big for us."   -- Minnesota point guard Luke Ridnour NOTABLE:  Milwaukee did not make a 3-pointer until the 8:53 mark in the fourth quarter. The finished the game shooting 15 percent behind the arc. UP NEXT:  For the Wolves, Saturday @ Memphis, Tuesday @ Miami, Wednesday @ Orlando.
