 THE FACT:   The Knicks went 12-for-34 on 3-points shots, and that was the biggest difference as New York beat the host Hawks 95-91.  
 
 THE LEAD: Carmelo Anthony  and new starter  J.R. Smith  each made three treys, as New York (3-4) made 8 of its first 14 3-point shots in building a 44-28 second quarter lead,. They then missed 14 straight long balls. Trailing 73-69 early in the fourth quarter, the Knicks made four of their final six treys to outscore the Hawks 30-23 in the final period for the win. 
 Anthony led the Knicks with 25 points, but struggled again with his shot (9-for-25). More importantly for New York, center  Andrea Bargnani  turned in his best game with 20 points and a season-high 11 rebounds. He hit both his 3-point shots in the fourth quarter. 
 The Hawks (4-4) struggled from distance, missing 14 of their 15 3-pointers through three quarters, but they were dominating in the paint in the absence of New York center Tyson Chandler (broken leg).  
 Atlanta center  Al Horford  had 23 points on 11-for-14 shooting, and point guard  Jeff Teague  (25 points, eight assists) ran circles around the Knicks for three quarters before missing five shots in the final period. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "You have to take what they give you. They gave us a lot of open shots. We didn't knock down those 3s, but we trust ourselves to keep shooting them. The only way to make them is to keep taking them. If people leave us open, we're going to shoot; we're not going to think about it." 
 -- Knicks guard  Iman Shumpert 
 
 
 THE STAT :  3 -- Against a Hawks team that was third in the league with an average of 10 steals per game, New York had just three turnovers. Atlanta had one steal, by forward  Paul Millsap . 
 
 TURNING POINT:   Shumpert's lone 3-pointer, with 9:14 left in the game, broke New York's streak of 14 straight missed treys and pulled the Knicks within 73-72. His teammates were 3-for-5 on 3s from there to the end of the game to win.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I want to start off by giving credit to New York and their defense tonight. They were the more aggressive team defensively for a lot of the night." 
 -- Hawks coach  Mike Budenholzer 
 
 
 HOT:   Horford was 11-for-14. . . . Anthony scored 10 points in the first quarter on 4-for-7 shooting before finishing 5-for-18.  
 
 NOT:   Put this in the category of stats that made little sense. The Hawks outscored the Knicks 56-28 in the paint, including 48-18 through three quarters, but lost. Why? They were just 5-for-24 3-pointers themselves. The Knicks were also outrebounded 47-37. . . . Millsap had his least productive game as a Hawk. Although he often did well defending Anthony, he scored but six points on 3-for-9 shooting and grabbed six rebounds. He was averaging 18.6 and 7.7. 
 
 NOTABLE:   Shumpert  on rumors Wednesday that he was the subject of trade talks between the Nuggets and New York where he might be traded for Nuggets big man  Kenneth Faried : "Yeah, it pissed me off, but that's what the New York media does. It's not the first time. It happens. [Woodson] told me not to worry about it. He said that if they put you in trade rumors, other people want you and you should smile about it. Whatever." . . . Hawks guard  Louis Williams , who has been out since tearing the right anterior cruciate ligament in January, has been cleared to participate in full-contact practice. He's working to get in game shape. . . .  Kyle Korver   hit two 3-pointers in the fourth quarter to stretch his streak of making at least one 3-pointer to 81 consecutive games -- second-longest in league history.  Dana Barros  holds the record at 89.
