  THE FACT:  The Houston Rockets prevailed in a game marred by 57 minutes of delays because of a leaking roof at the Verizon Center. 
 
 THE LEAD:   James Harden  scored 25 points,  Dwight Howard  had 23 and  Terrence Jones  had 19 and a career-high 17 rebounds as the Rockets held off a furious Washington Wizards rally to score a 114-107 win on Saturday night. 
 Washington trailed by 25 points early in the third quarter, after the second of two delays, and turned the game around to take a 102-97 lead with 5:26 to play. 
 Harden scored eight straight points to give Houston a 105-102 lead with 1:54 to play and the Rockets got the win. 
 
 John Wall  led the Wizards with 23 points and 10 rebounds.  Trevor Ariza  had 23 and 14 rebounds.  Kevin Seraphin  had a season-high 18 points. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It seemed like it took forever." --  Harden on the marathon evening. The game was three hours and 18 minutes, including stoppages. 
 
 
 THE STAT:   Fifty-seven minutes of delays caused by a leaking roof. The first delay early in the second quarter was 35 minutes, and the second, a 22-minute stoppage, came before the third quarter started. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "The craziest game ever. I just didn't like it for the fans." --  Dwight Howard 
 
 
 TURNING POINT:   Harden's eight straight points in two minutes and forty seconds that gave Houston a five-point lead. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "Now, I wish they would have just canceled it." --  Washington coach  Randy Wittman  on enduring the two delays. 
 
 
 HOT:  Howard was 10-for-17 from the field. He missed seven of his 10 free throws. 
 
 NOT:  The Wizards'  Bradley Beal  was just 4-for-16 from the field and missed all four of his 3-pointers. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:   Jones, who played sparingly last season, took control of the boards for the Rockets late. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Beal was 0-for-4 from the field in the fourth quarter when the Wizards needed him the most. 
 
 IN THE ARENA:  Howard played one-on-one with a young fan during the first stoppage. The eight-year-old was sitting in the front row, and Howard jokingly blocked his shots.   
 
 QUOTABLE IV:   "Kind of got my mojo going. Got to work on my defense if I want to get defensive player of the year," Howard said. 
 
 UP NEXT:   For the Rockets: Monday @ Boston, Wednesday @ New Orleans, Thursday vs. Oklahoma City 
 For the Wizards: Monday @ Chicago, Wednesday vs. Miami, Friday vs. Chicago
