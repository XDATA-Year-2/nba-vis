 THE FACTS: Al Horford  recorded his third career 20-20 game with 23 points and a career-high tying 22 rebounds, lifting the Atlanta Hawks to a 114-103 victory over the Detroit Pistons at The Palace of Auburn Hills on Monday. Atlanta won for the fifth time in six games.  Josh Smith  also had 23 points, and  Jeff Teague  added 20 with 12 assists for the Hawks.  Rodney Stuckey's  22 points led Detroit, which has lost four of five games since the All-Star break.  Jonas Jerebko  had a season-high 21 points, and  Greg Monroe  added 15 points, eight rebounds and five assists. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "The most important thing was we got the win. I could have done all that and I would have been upset if we lost. I'm very happy. It is special. A 20-20 game, I've been wanting one of those all year and I finally got one." --  Horford on his monster performance. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  78. Atlanta had assists on 78 percent of its baskets (31-of-40). That's a testament to their ball movement and ability to push the pace. The Hawks came into the game having assisted on 65 percent of their made baskets, tops in the league. While Teague was primarily responsible for making the right pass, nine of his teammates also made at least one assist against the Pistons. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Hawks were up by three midway through the second but stretched the lead to double digits by halftime. Teague and Horford were the driving forces behind the surge, combining for 20 of the Hawks' 34 second-quarter points. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Al's been playing amazing basketball for the past six weeks. This has been going on for awhile. He's such a solid player. He always makes the right read. He's got a great mid-range game and a great pump-fake and one-to-two dribble move toward the basket. We're so much better when he's playing this way." 
 --  Hawks swingman  Kyle Korver  on Horford. 
 
 
 HOT:  Horford entered the game averaging 24.2 points and 10 rebounds over the past five games. He was even more unstoppable Monday, knocking down 10-of-13 shots. He also added three assists, two blocks and two steals. Horford has four straight double-doubles against the Pistons, dating back to the 2010-11 season. He has always played well against the Pistons, averaging 14.3 points and 10.6 rebounds in his previous 16 career games against them. 
 
 NOT: Jose Calderon  was averaging 53.7 percent from the field in his first 10 games with the Pistons since the veteran point guard was acquired from Toronto in late January. He suffered through a 3-for-11 shooting performance while scoring seven points against the Hawks. Calderon, second only to  Chris Paul  in assists-to-turnover ratio entering the contest, also made four turnovers. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Detroit guard  Kim English  scored a career-high 10 points but swingman  Khris Middleton , who averaged 9.5 points in his previous two games, was held to four points in 23 minutes. Atlanta guard  John Jenkins  had six points and two assists in 17 minutes. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Atlanta is 2-0 on its six-game road trip. ... Detroit second-year guard  Brandon Knight  missed his third straight game with a hyper-extended right knee. Backup point guard  Will Bynum  sat out because of a one-game league suspension for striking Indiana's  Tyler Hansbrough  in the midsection on Saturday. ... Korver extended his streak of making at least one 3-pointer to 49 games, the longest in Hawks history. ... Horford's previous 20-20 games came against Miami on Feb. 27, 2009 and Dallas on Nov. 20, 2010 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Hawks, Wednesday @ Utah, Friday @ Phoenix, Sunday @ L.A. Lakers. For the Pistons, Wednesday @ Washington, Friday @ New Orleans, Sunday @ San Antonio.
