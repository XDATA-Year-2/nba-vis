 THE FACT:  Oklahoma City won for the first time this season on the second night of a back-to-back, becoming the final team in the NBA to do so.  
 
 THE LEAD:  Taking advantage of a short-handed Memphis team, Oklahoma City came out and established its dominance from start to finish in a 116-100 win over the Grizzlies Wednesday night at FedExForum.  Russell Westbrook  led the way for the Thunder with a game-high 27 points, nine assists and six rebounds.  Kevin Durant  added 18 points and six rebounds. The Grizzlies were led by  Mike Conley 's 20 points and nine assists, while  Zach Randolph  had 17 points and eight boards.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It was great. I got my work done early, so it was good." 
 -- Oklahoma City guard Westbrook getting to sit out the fourth quarter with his team holding a big lead. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Oklahoma City has won 12 of its last 13 games, and since their lone loss during that streak (Dec. 4 at Portland), the Thunder have averaged 111 points and are shooting .527 from the floor. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Holding a 57-42 lead at the half, the Thunder made sure there would be no third quarter runs by the Grizzlies. Instead, the starters pushed the lead to 20, and the bench increased it to 24, which allowed Westbrook, Durant and  Kendrick Perkins  to take the fourth quarter off on the second night of a back-to-back. 
 
 HOT:   Jeremy Lamb  came off the bench red-hot for Oklahoma City, hitting 7 of his 9 shots, including 3-of-4 from 3-point range as he scored a career-high 18 points. 
 
 NOT:  Grizzlies center  Kosta Koufos  continues to struggle scoring around the basket. Koufos was 3-of-0 from the floor. In his last three games, Koufos is 10-for-33 (.303) from the floor. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We just have to keep plugging away and coming to practice every day. One thing that is big for me is, I don't want to come to practice every day and it be just a chore. It's not enjoyable what is going on out there. Losing by two or 22, losing at home, we take a great deal of pride in playing at home. It hurts." 
 -- Grizzlies coach  Dave Joerger 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Thunder shot .563 from the floor, which is the highest field goal percentage allowed by the Grizzlies at FedExForum since Dec. 3, 2010 when Houston shot .595 from the floor. Oklahoma City also shot a season-high .500 from 3-point range, making 9 of 18. The Thunder entered the game shooting just .331 from long range. ... The Grizzlies lost for the first time this season when they scored 100 points. They are now 5-1 in such games, and 45-5 over the last two seasons. ...  Jon Leuer  scored 17 points off the bench for the Grizzlies. He has now scored in double figures in three straight games.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Thunder, Friday vs. L.A. Lakers, Sunday vs. Orlando, Tuesday at Denver. For the Grizzlies, Friday at New Orleans, Sunday vs. Minnesota, Tuesday vs. L.A. Lakers.
