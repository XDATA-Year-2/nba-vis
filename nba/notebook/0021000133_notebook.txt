Richardson, for NBA.com Posted Saturday November 13, 2010 11:15PM THE FACTS:   Dwyane Wade  scored 31 points to lead the Miami Heat to a 109-100 victory against the Toronto Raptors Saturday at AmericanAirlines Arena. Four of the Heat's five starters scored in double figures as Miami ended a two-game losing streak.  QUOTABLE:  "I'm glad we got it out of the way. I'm glad we got to play each other. I'm glad we won, most importantly." --  Heat forward  Chris Bosh , on facing his former team for the first time. THE STAT:  The Heat had six players score in double-figures, including a double-double (10 points, 10 rebounds) off the bench from  Udonis Haslem  and a 14-point night from reserve marksman  James Jones . TURNING POINT:  The Heat scored the game's first seven points and never looked back. HOT:  After shooting 2-for-12 in Thursday's loss to Boston,  Dwyane Wade  was 11 of 16 from the field. NOT:   Andrea Bargnani  was just 8 of 23 from the field. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:   LeBron James  recorded his third straight double-double as he had 23 points and a game-high 11 assists. GOOD MOVE:  Heat coach  Erik Spoelstra  started  Zydrunas Ilgauskas  instead of  Joel Anthony  at center. Ilgauskas scored 12 points on 6 of 7 shooting. BAD MOVE:  The Raptors looked unprepared to face Ilgauskas. Most of his points came off open looks. ROOKIE WATCH:  Raptors 7-footer  Solomon Alabi , the 50th pick of the 2010 Draft, saw his first regular-season action. He played the final 18 seconds of the first quarter. NOTABLE:  Ilgauskas' 12 points nearly bettered Anthony's season scoring total (15). UP NEXT:  For the Heat, Wednesday vs. Phoenix, Friday vs. Charlotte, Saturday @ Memphis. For the Raptors, Tuesday @ Washington, Wednesday @ Philadelphia, Friday vs. Houston.
