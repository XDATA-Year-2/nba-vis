 THE FACT:  With their victory over the Cavaliers on Saturday, the Bulls recorded their first home win since Dec. 5 when they crushed the Heat 107-87. They lost four straight road games in between at Detroit, Milwaukee, Toronto and Orlando.    
 
 THE LEAD:  The host Chicago Bulls (10-16) ended a four-game losing streak with a dominant 100-84 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers (10-16).  Carlos Boozer  had 19 points and  D.J. Augustin  had 18 points and 10 assists while playing the first 46 minutes of the game.  Joakim Noah  had 11 points and 18 rebounds for the Bulls.  Andrew Bynum  had 19 points and  Kyrie Irving  had 14 points for the Cavaliers.    
 
 THE FACTS II:  The Bulls played with four key contributors out due to injury --  Derrick Rose ,  Jimmy Butler ,  Luol Deng  and  Kirk Hinrich . But they shot 60 percent in the first half and controlled the game from the outset.     
 
 QUOTABLE I:  "I love to get my teammates involved. That gives me confidence in my offense." 
 -- Augustin, saying his assists helped him with his scoring.   
 
 
 THE STAT:  Not only did the Bulls shoot 53.6 percent from the field, but they also shot 67 percent from 3-point range, going 10-for-15 from outside. Rookie Tony Snell was 5-for-8 from 3-point range.     
 
 THE STAT II:  The Bulls committed 21 turnovers, while the Cavaliers had only nine points. The Cavaliers got 17 of their points off Bulls miscues. 
 
 THE STAT III:  The Cavaliers attempted 90 shots to just 69 by the Bulls.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Bulls were holding on to a single-digit lead in the second quarter when they scored nine straight points to go ahead 58-41 just before the end of the half.   
 
 INJURY UPDATE:  For the Bulls,  Luol Deng  (Achilles),  Jimmy Butler  (ankle) and  Kirk Hinric h (back) missed the game, but Deng and Hinrich could be back by the time the Bulls play again Wednesday in Brooklyn.  Dion Waiters  did not play because of a right wrist injury but could return for Cleveland's next game against Detroit on Monday.     
 
 HOT:  After going through a very cold couple of weeks, Boozer returned against his old team to go 8-for-14 from the field. Augustin was 7-for-12. Andrew Bynum was 9-for-15 from the field for the Cavaliers.  
 
 NOT:  Irving was only 5-for-16 from the field in one of his worst performances in recent weeks.  C. J. Miles  didn't help, going 1-for-5 from the field.   
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I loved the way Tony Snell played.''  
 -- Bulls coach  Tom Thibodeau . 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  With Butler joining the walking wounded for the Bulls, Thibodeau came up with a good starting lineup as Augustin and Snell played well together.     
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Cavaliers' defense allowed a huge number of bounce passes inside by the Bulls, who had layup after layup as a result.   
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Snell played a season-high 44 minutes, and had 17 points, five rebounds and three assists. Cavaliers' first-round draft pick  Anthony Bennett  stayed in Cleveland with an illness.  Matthew Dellavedova  contributed 10 points and four assists off the bench for Cleveland.  
 
 NOTABLE:  The Bulls, who rank 29th in the league in field-goal percentage, shot 65 percent in the first quarter. ... The Bulls failed to score 80 points in four of their previous eight games before scoring 60 in the first half Saturday. ...  Nazr Mohammed  matched his season high with six points, all in the first half. ... The Cavaliers are 2-12 on the road this season, and only Philadelphia is worse among Eastern Conference teams. ... The Bulls and Cavaliers are now tied for third place in the Central Division at 10-16. ... Augustin grabbed his left hamstring on an inbounds play in the fourth quarter but kept playing. ... The Bulls' bench was 8-for-14 from the field.        
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Bulls, Wednesday @ Brooklyn, Dec. 28 vs. Dallas, Dec. 30 @ Memphis. For the Cavaliers, Monday vs. Detroit, Friday vs. Atlanta, Dec. 28 @ Boston.
