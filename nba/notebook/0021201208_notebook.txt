 THE FACTS:  Led by reserves  Jerryd Bayless ,  Keyon Dooling  and  Ed Davis , the Memphis Grizzlies outworked the Dallas Mavericks in the second half and earned a 103-97 victory Monday at the American Airlines Center. The win kept Memphis (55-26) in the hunt for homecourt advantage in the first round of the playoffs and also snapped a streak of 12 straight winning seasons by Dallas (40-41). 
 After trailing for the entire first half by as many as 14 points, Memphis turned up the defensive pressure after intermission. The Grizzlies scored 19 points off 11 turnovers and outrebounded Dallas by 12 in the second half. Bayless finished with 19 points, four assists, four rebounds and four steals. Dooling added 13 points and Davis had a double-double with 11 points and 11 boards, including seven on the offensive glass.  Tayshaun Prince  was the only starter in double figures with 12 points. 
 
 Dirk Nowitzki  scored a game-high 26 points,  Vince Carter  added 22 off the Dallas bench and  Mike James  had 14 points. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "In the first half our guys didn't come out and compete. They were treating it like an exhibition game. I got on them a little bit before we started the third quarter and we scored 65 points in the second half. We got up and down the court, we defended, and got the bench guys in." 
 
 -- Memphis coach  Lionel Hollins 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Grizzlies scored a season-best 64 bench points, smashing the previous high of 50 points set in a 113-81 win at Sacramento on Jan. 7. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Grizzlies took command with a 9-0 run in the fourth quarter, starting with a 3-pointer by Dooling with 8:18 remaining and ending with a three-point play by Davis that made it 86-79 with 6:41 left. 
 
 HOT:  Dooling and Carter were both 4-for-5 from 3-point distance. 
 
 NOT:  Mavericks guard  O.J. Mayo  had another tough night against his old team, finishing with just two points on 1-for-6 shooting (0-for-4 from downtown) and a team-high four turnovers. In four games this season against Memphis, he averaged 8.0 points on 35.1 percent shooting (13-for-37) with 15 turnovers and 11 assists. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "If I was playing against my former team, I'd come out ready to go. I'd come out ready to go at them, but that's me. ... He didn't compete tonight." 
 
 -- Mavericks coach  Rick Carlisle  on Mayo 
 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  There was a moment of silence before the National Anthem for the victims of the bombings at the Boston Marathon. ... Prior to the opening tip, fans gave Nowitzki a standing ovation for becoming the 17th player in NBA history to reach the 25,000-point milestone in Sunday night's victory in New Orleans. 
 
 NOTABLE:  With a reverse layup at 3:30 of the first quarter, Carter passed Hall of Famer  Clyde Drexler  (22,195) for 27th place on the NBA's all-time scoring list. ... Memphis has held 70 of 81 opponents to fewer than 100 points, matching the team record set in 2005-06. ... The Grizzlies took three out of four in the season series. ... Memphis is 23-1 when scoring 100 or more points and 42-2 when posting a higher field-goal percentage than its opponent. ... Nowitzki had a four-point play in the fourth quarter. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Wednesday vs. New Orleans. For the Grizzlies, Wednesday vs. Utah.
