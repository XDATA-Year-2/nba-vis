  Pacers-Hawks notebook   By Matt Winkeljohn, for NBA.com Posted Saturday January 8, 2011 11:42PM THE FACTS:  The Hawks had five players hit double figures in scoring -- by the middle of the third quarter -- and routed the visiting Pacers 108-93 Saturday night, making 11 3-pointers as  Josh Smith  led the way with 27 points, 10 rebounds, six assists and two blocked shots. Atlanta's ninth straight win over Indiana was tight in the first half, which ended with the Hawks up 55-50. A 29-18 scoring bulge in the third quarter rendered the rest of the game moot.  Joe Johnson  added 24 points and  Jamal Crawford  20 in the Hawks' sixth win in the last seven games.  Danny Granger  scored 16 for the Pacers, who never led while losing their third straight and falling for the sixth time in seven outings. QUOTABLE:  "It's fun; we're getting everybody involved. Jamal is starting to play like himself again ... Joe as well."    -- Hawks center-forward  Al Horford , who had 14 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. THE STAT:  62.5 -- Atlanta's Johnson (3-for-5), Crawford (3-for-5) and  Mike Bibby  (4-for-6) made 62.5 percent of their combined 3-points shots (10-for-16 on a night when Atlanta went 11-for-22). TURNING POINT:  Neither team shot well in the third quarter (Indiana made eight of 24 field goals, Atlanta nine of 25), but the Hawks were 4-for-7 on 3-pointers in the period (Indiana made one trey in the period) and outscored the Pacers by six at the free-throw line in the third while pushing their lead to as high as 20 points. QUOTABLE II:  "We are lacking an inside attack right now, and it's just stifling us. [The Hawks] have a great inside attack, they have a great spacing attack, they have terrific post one-on-one players, they're terrific face-up one-on-one players, and that's with athletes that are better than the athletes that we have."    -- Pacers coach  Jim O'Brien , whose team was actually out-scored by a modest 32-28 margin in the paint. HOT:  Atlanta's Smith and Bibby carried the action in the third quarter, combining for 26 of the Hawks' 29 points. Smith scored 14 points on 5-for-9 shooting and hit all three of his free throws, and Bibby went 3-for-4, hitting three treys, and added three free throws as well for 12 of his 15 points in the quarter. ... Hawks sub Jamal Crawford made 10 of 19 shots, and three of five 3-pointers, to continue a roll. In the past five games, he has averaged 25.8 points, making 40 of 78 shots (51.3 percent) and 15 of 30 3-pointers (50 percent). ... Joe Johnson has averaged 27.5 points over the past four after scoring 24 Saturday. He scored 12 in the fourth quarter Saturday. NOT:  The Pacers have lost nine straight games on the road, and eight straight in Atlanta, dating to Dec. 22, 2006. ... O'Brien continues to be disappointed in the offense of center  Roy Hibbert . He scored eight points Saturday on 3-for-8 shooting as he returned to the starting lineup one night after scoring 10 off the bench in a loss to San Antonio in which he was 5-for-17. ... Indy's  James Posey  has made just four of 19 shots over the past five games, including three of 18 3-pointers. He's attempted only one non-trey in that time, and he made it Saturday as he went 2-for-6 (1-for-4 on treys). QUOTABLE III:  "It sucks right now."    -- Pacers forward Danny Granger, when asked about Indiana's effort. ROOKIE WATCH:  Pacers youngster  Paul George  scored eight of his 10 points in the fourth quarter, when he also grabbed two of his six rebounds. Yet when Indianapolis coach  Jim O'Brien  was asked if he was encouraged by the way the rookie forward played in the fourth quarter, he said, "No. He played terrible defense." NOTABLE:  Atlanta reserve guard  Jeff Teague  left the game in the second quarter with a contusion to his right hand, and did not return. ... Atlanta small forward  Marvin Williams  missed his fifth straight game with a back contusion. UP NEXT:  For the Pacers, Tuesday at Philadelphia, Wednesday vs. Dallas, Friday vs. Chicago. For the Hawks, Tuesday vs. Milwaukee, Wednesday @ Toronto, Saturday vs. Houston.
