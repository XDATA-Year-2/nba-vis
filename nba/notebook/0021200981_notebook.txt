 THE FACTS: Spencer Hawes  had 18 points, 16 rebounds, eight assists and seven blocked shots Saturday night as the Philadelphia 76ers pulled away in the fourth quarter to beat the Indiana Pacers 98-91 in the Wells Fargo Center. 
 
 Jrue Holiday  paced the Sixers (25-40) with 27 points, 20 of those coming in the first half, and added 12 assists.  Evan Turner  notched six of his 11 points in a 19-4 run over the first 6:15 of the fourth quarter, when Philadelphia turned a one-point deficit into a 90-76 lead. 
 The Sixers, who also saw  Dorell Wright  and  Thaddeus Young  contribute 13 points apiece, won for just the second time in the last eight games and the third time in 16. 
 
 Roy Hibbert  had 25 points and 10 rebounds for Indiana (40-26), which dropped its second straight.  David West  and  Paul George  added 18 points each. George also had 14 rebounds and eight assists. 
 
 George Hill  chipped in 13 points and eight assists for Indiana. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "The first key for us was to be able to stand up to them. Their feeling is, they're the bigger, stronger team, and they can bully us. Sometimes it's nice if you can do some of the hitting and not the receiving." 
 
 -- Sixers coach  Doug Collins 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The last NBA player to have 18-plus points, 16-plus rebounds, eight-plus assists and seven-plus blocks in one game was Houston's  Hakeem Olajuwon  against Milwaukee on March 29, 1990. The last Sixer to post such numbers was  Charles Barkley  against Portland on Nov. 28, 1986. 
 Hawes had career highs in rebounds and blocked shots. The Sixers as a team recorded 14 blocks, tying a season high and matching a team record in the Wells Fargo Center, while limiting Indiana to 38.6-percent shooting. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Sixers outscored the Pacers 19-4 over the first 6:15 of the fourth quarter to turn a one-point deficit into a 90-76 lead. 
 
 HOT:  Hawes was 7-for-14 and Young 5-for-7 for the Sixers. West shot 8-for-13 for the Pacers. 
 
 NOT:  Hibbert was just 9-for-26 from the field. George was 6-for-17 and Hill went 5-for-15.  Damien Wilkins  was just 4-for-11 for the Sixers. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "You know coming in, this is going to be one of the more physical teams. I think last time they took advantage of us in that area (en route to an 88-69 victory over the Sixers on Feb. 6), and I think this time we were more up for the challenge." 
 
 -- Hawes  
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Besides Hawes, Holiday had six rebounds while committing just three turnovers. He shot 12-for-25 from the floor. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The announced attendance was 18,587. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "We just died (in the fourth quarter). We died on plays, it's as simple as that." 
 
 -- George 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Collins said he inserted a new offensive set during Friday's practice that "really benefited" his team. The Sixers shot a healthy 49.4 percent, and logged 28 assists on their 39 field goals. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  That was on the part of the schedule-maker, who had the Pacers in Philadelphia one night after a tough 99-93 home loss to the Lakers. That defeat was particularly disturbing to Indiana, because Lakers star  Kobe Bryant  only played a quarter due to an ankle sprain. Moreover, coach  Frank Vogel  said, "I think our guys were a little too amped up. I think our adrenaline got the best of us." 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Indiana's  Orlando Johnson  had five points, three rebounds and two assists in 21:06, while the Sixers'  Arnett Moultrie  had two rebounds and two blocked shots in 9:06. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Hawes has three double-doubles over his last five games, and 12 overall. ... Holiday had his 18th double-double of the season. ... The Sixers limited the Pacers to five second-chance points in the second half, after Indiana piled up 17 in the first half. ... George had 13 of his points in the fourth quarter. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Pacers, Monday @ Cleveland, Tuesday vs. Orlando, Thursday vs. Milwaukee. For the Sixers, Monday vs. Portland, Wednesday @ L.A. Clippers, Thursday @ Denver.
