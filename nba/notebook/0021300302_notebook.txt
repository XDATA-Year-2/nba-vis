 THE FACT:  Oklahoma City extends its opening season home-court winning streak to 10 straight games (best in the NBA). 
 
 THE LEAD: Kevin Duran t and  Russell Westbrook  each had double-doubles and combined to score 62 points to lead the Thunder to a surprisingly easy 118-94 win over the Indiana Pacers. 
 Oklahoma City never trailed and led by as many as 29. Durant led the way with 36 points and 10 rebounds. Westbrook scored 26 and handed out 13 assists.  Serge Ibaka  added 13 points on 6-for-8 shooting and  Reggie Jackson  came off the bench to score 15 points. 
 
 Paul George  had a huge second half (26 points) and led Indiana with 32.  Roy Hibbert  added 12 and  David West  had 11. 
 The Pacers seemed to show the effects of coming to the end of a five-game road trip and were also playing on the second night of a back-to-back. They struggled all night shooting the ball and they couldn't stop Oklahoma City.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Oklahoma City was just a step quicker on both sides of the court tonight and you have to give them credit. I think it was their defense that was the difference. They had great energy and they took us out of a lot of our stuff." --  Pacers head coach  Frank Vogel. 
 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I thought our guys did a great job of executing the game plan. We're a good defensive team too, we don't necessarily tell the world that. But we play with a lot of pride on the defensive end." --  Thunder head coach  Scott Brooks. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Indiana came into the game with the NBA's best defense, allowing opposing teams to score just 88.1 points per game on 39.8 percent shooting. Tonight OKC shot 61.0 percent (the worst defensive effort of the year by the Pacers) and scored 118 points (the most given up by Indiana this season). The Thunder shot 68.6 percent in the second half. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Thunder have had some problems in third quarters this season and had some tonight defensively allowing Indiana to score 32 points. But OKC was hot in that quarter too, outscoring the Pacers by a bucket to keep the pressure on and extend the lead to a game-high 29 points. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "I wouldn't say we had tired legs but the Thunder definitely knew what we were up against. They knew this was a back-to-back night for us. They came out with that urgency to really run us and see if we could compete and match their energy." --  George. 
 
 
 HOT:  Durant hit six of his first seven shots (14 points)...In the first 10 minutes of the game OKC shot 68.8 percent (11-for-16)...The Thunder finished the first half at 54.8 percent...Durant was 7-for-14 (19 points) and Westbrook was 6-for-10 (12 points) at the break...Durant was 7-for-9 (17 points) in the second half...George was 7-for-10 (4-for-5 on threes) in the second half and scored 26 points...OKC outrebounded Indiana 46-29. 
 
 NOT:  The Pacers started the game just 2-for-14 (14.3 percent) and finished the first half at 32.6 percent (15-for-46)...Indiana was 0-for-9 on threes in the first 24 minutes...George was 2-for-7 (six points). 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA : For Thunder and Pacers fans watching around the country on League Pass or locally the telecasts had a different look. The state-of-the-art TV production truck that is normally used couldn't make the drive up from Dallas due to icy roads. So the teams had to share a truck rented locally in Oklahoma City. Two audio paths could be provided but only one video feed. So that one feed was kept pretty generic. 
 
 GOOD MOVE: Reggie  Jackson  with a drive to the basket in the fourth quarter, he spun at the last moment to avoid a defender and ended up with a behind the back layup. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Thunder backup center  Steven Adams  played almost 18 minutes, scored five points, grabbed four rebounds and blocked two shots. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Thunder's 61 percent shooting night is the best since March 30th, 2012 against Charlotte (63 percent). 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Pacers: Tuesday vs. Miami, Friday vs. Charlotte, Monday vs. Detroit. For the Thunder: Tuesday @ Atlanta, Wednesday @ Memphis, Friday vs. LA Lakers.
