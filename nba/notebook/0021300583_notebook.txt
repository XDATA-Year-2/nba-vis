 THE FACT:  The Sixers have dropped 16 of the last 17 games to the Heat in the regular season. 
 
 THE LEAD: Chris Bosh  scored 25 points and  LeBron James  added a stellar all-around effort with 21 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds, leading the Miami Heat past the Philadelphia 76ers 101-86 Friday night at the Wells Fargo Center.  
 
 Shane Battier  and  Norris Cole  scored 13 points each, while  Mario Chalmers  had 10.  Dwyane Wade  had eight points in 25 minutes. The Heat (28-11) snapped their three-game losing streak.  Tony Wroten  led the Sixers (13-26) with 13 points off the bench.  Evan Turner  added 11, while  Spencer Hawes  had 10 points and 10 rebounds.  Thaddeus Young  and  Hollis Thompson  also scored 10 points apiece for the Sixers. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We came in with a better focus, a better intensity, with the way we played defensively." 
 -- Heat coach  Erik Spoelstra , on ending a season-high three-game skid 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Sixers missed 18 of their 20 shots from beyond the arc. It's tough to win in this league with 10-percent shooting from 3-point territory. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Heat started strong, led by 10 after the first quarter and later by 17 at halftime. They never trailed en route to an easy 15-point victory. 
 
 HOT:  Bosh was terrific, going 11-for-18. James was 7-for-13, while Battier and Cole each shot 5-for-9. 
 
 NOT:  Young missed 10 of his 13 shots, Wroten was 4-for-13 and Michael Carter-Williams was 1-for-7. The Sixers shot just 36.9 percent overall -- 31-for-84. They also shot just 22-for-37 from the free-throw line. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Heat put the ball in James' hands much of the second half, and the Sixers had no answer. It allowed Chalmers to move freely around the perimeter and the decision worked very well. James was nearly unstoppable in the second half and controlled the tempo. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Sixers could have attacked the rim much more, especially on a cold-shooting night. To be fair, they did shoot 37 free throws. But for a large chunk of the first half, too many jumpers were launched. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  There was an energetic crowd for the Heat, which is no surprise. Miami took an early double-digit lead and never looked back, causing the 19,286 fans to be relatively quiet most of the night. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "For us to win multiple games and contend for a title, we have to defend." 
 -- Miami's LeBron James 
 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "They stopped us from our penetration and getting good looks." 
 --  Michael Carter-Williams 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Chalmers was in the starting lineup despite dealing with a right Achilles strain. ... Heat forward-center  Chris "Birdman" Andersen  was out because of a right knee contusion. ... Sixers forward  Lavoy Allen  missed his fourth straight game with a right calf injury. ... The Sixers scored below 90 points for the fourth time this season. They're 0-4 when that happens. ... Miami improved to 7-0 when holding the opponent to less than 90 points and 76-5 since James joined the team for the 2010-11 season. ... James scored 10 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter. It was the sixth double-double of the season for him. ... Hawes has three double-doubles over his last four games. ... The Sixers committed 23 turnovers and had just 16 assists. It marked the second straight game with more turnovers than assists. ... The Heat led by as many as 25. ... Bosh blocked five shots. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Heat, Saturday @ Charlotte, Monday @ Atlanta, Tuesday vs. Boston. For the Sixers, Saturday @ Chicago, Monday @ Washington, Wednesday @ New York.
