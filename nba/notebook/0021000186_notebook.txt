  Thunder-Bucks notebook   By Rick Braun, for NBA.com Posted Sunday November 21, 2010 12:24AM THE FACTS:  No  Kevin Durant ? No  Jeff Green ? No problem.  James Harden  dropped in six 3-pointers on his way to 23 points as he helped the Oklahoma City Thunder sweat out an 82-81 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks Saturday night at the Bradley Center. Durant missed his second straight game with a sprained left ankle, and Green missed his seventh straight, also with a sprained left ankle. Nonetheless, the Thunder (9-4) won their fourth straight while the Bucks (5-8) lost their third straight, QUOTABLE:  "It felt good tonight. There were a couple that I passed up, and even the two that I missed felt good. So I'm just trying to be aggressive and ready to shoot."   -- Harden on his 6-for-8 shooting on 3-pointers. THE STAT:  The two teams combined for a horrible offensive night, with the Bucks shooting just 37.7 percent (29-for-77) and the Thunder even worse at 37 percent (27-for-73). For the Bucks, that's becoming a theme, as they have now shot worse than 40 percent in more than half of their games (7 of 13). TURNING POINT:  The Bucks kept making runs at Oklahoma City but never could get back to even. Milwaukee first got within a point in the fourth quarter at 67-66 on a  Brandon Jennings  3-pointer and a  John Salmons  jumper where his toe was barely on the line with 7:02 left. But  Russell Westbrook  (18 points, six assists) made two free throws and  Thabo Sefolosha  stole a pass and went in for a layup to make it 71-66 wit 6:08 left. After Milwaukee pulled within a point at 75-74 on baskets by  Andrew Bogut  and Jennings, Harden made his sixth 3-pointer of the night to make it 78-74 with 2:17 left. QUOTABLE II:  "That's what the NBA is about. You always play your heart out and see what happens at the end, and I thought both teams did. We had a couple of runs and we prevented them from having a big run."   -- Thunder coach  Scott Brooks . HOT:  Harden made 6-for-8 shots from behind the arc on his way to a season-high 23 points. He's 16-for-39 (41 percent) on the season on 3s. NOT:  Harden went 0-for-5 on shots inside the arc and is just 16-for-45 (35.6 percent) on two-point attempts for the season. GOOD MOVE:  When it mattered most down the stretch as the Bucks were forced to foul in the final 20 seconds, the Thunder got the ball into the hands of Westbrook on two huge possessions. He entered the game shooting 91.2 percent from the line and went 8-for-8, including four in the final 16.8 seconds. NOTABLE:  Harden's first 3-pointer of the night gave the Thunder the lead for good at 5-4, and the lead reached as many as 13. But it hardly seemed like a wire-to-wire victory. Milwaukee pulled within a point six times in the final 7:02 and the ball two times in the final minute with a chance to take the lead. Salmons' entry pass to Bogut in the post was stolen by  Nick Collison  with 54 seconds left, and after Westbrook missed a jumper with 39 seconds left, Jennings' 20-footer rimmed out and  Luc Richard Mbah a Moute 's tip attempt also hit off the rim. Westbrook then sealed the game with pairs of free throws with 16.8 and 7.3 seconds left. ... Jennings led all scorers with 25 points, and Milwaukee forward  Drew Gooden  had 16 points and 16 rebounds. ... Bogut only played 29:42 because of foul trouble but still had 12 rebounds.
