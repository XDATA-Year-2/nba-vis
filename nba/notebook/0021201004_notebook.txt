 THE FACTS:   For whatever reason,  Tyler Hansbrough  comes to life as a starter.  Gerald Green  just wants to play. The two combined for 29 points as Indiana won its second blowout in two nights, dominating Orlando 95-73 Tuesday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. Making his third start of the season for the injured  David West,  Hansbrough had 14 points and 14 rebounds. Green, who returned to the rotation this week after two months buried in the bench, had 15 points and eight rebounds off the bench.  Paul George  led Indiana (42-26) with 19 points.  Moe Harkless  and  Arron Afflalo  had 10 apiece for Orlando (18-50), which shot just .318 from the field. 
 
 QUOTABLE:   "After four games in five nights, to beat a team by 22 points, a team that has been playing well, is a really, really good effort by our guys. When you play a fourth game in five nights, you need somebody like  Tyler Hansbrough  to bring the energy he brought tonight." 
  -- Pacers Coach  Frank Vogel 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Orlando Coach  Jacque Vaughn  earned his first two technical fouls and his first ejection of the season with 4:47 left in the third period. That leaves Cleveland's  Byron Scott  as the only NBA head coach without a technical foul this season. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Orlando kept it close much of the first half and trailed just 25-21 midway through the second quarter. But Green and Hansbrough combined for 13 points as Indiana closed the half on a 17-8 run to take a 42-29 advantage into the locker room. The Magic never threatened thereafter. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:   "I just happened to get some good looks and focused on my rebounding. I was able to get good minutes and do my thing." 
 -- Hansbrough  
 
 
 HOT:  In three starts this season, Hansbrough has produced three double-doubles while averaging 17.0 points and 11.7 rebounds on .462 shooting. ... Green has totaled 35 points and 14 rebounds in the last two games off the bench, shooting 13-for-26 (.500) overall and 7-for-13 (.538) from the 3-point line. ...  George Hill  scored 14 on 6-for-11 shooting.  
 
 NOT:  Orlando's starting five combined to shoot 16-for-63 (.254) and scored a paltry 43 points. ...  Lance Stephenson  continued his recent slump, shooting 1-for-5. In the last six games, he has shot 13-for-47 (.277) and averaged 5.8 points.  
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "I guess it was an accumulation of the game. We had a player who got hit in the mouth ... but, tough game." 
  -- Vaughn on his ejection. 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Hansbrough did not return after sustaining an abdominal cramp after a tip-in on the final bucket of the third period. He is not expected to miss any time as a result. ...  Hansbrough's nine offensive rebounds tied a career high. ...  Orlando Johnson  had a career-high five assists for Indiana. ... West missed his second consecutive game with a lower-back sprain, but the Pacers hope he can return for Friday's game against Milwaukee. ...  Danny Granger  has been cleared to resume full activity but won't play tonight, and is unlikely to play in the weekend games Friday and Saturday. Granger missed the first 55 games with left knee tendinosis, returned to play five off the bench but knee pain returned and he has been back on the shelf since March 3. ... Orlando was without  Glen Davis  (fractured left foot) and Hedo Turkoglu, who is eligible to return from his 20-game NBA suspension next Wednesday. 
 
 UP NEXT:   For the Pacers, Friday vs. Milwaukee, Saturday at Chicago, Monday vs. Atlanta. For the Magic, Wednesday at New York, Friday vs. Oklahoma City, Monday vs. Miami.
