  Notebook: Knicks 108, Magic 86 Posted Wednesday March 28, 2012 11:23PM By Joshua Newman, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  Strained right groin or not, the New York Knicks needed  Carmelo Anthony  to take control with  Amar'e Stoudemire  (bulging disc in lower back) and  Jeremy Lin  (sore left knee) sidelined. Anthony was happy to oblige. With a noticeable limp and hampered lateral movement, Anthony gutted out a 25-point night in 26 minutes of action, all over the first three quarters, to propel the Knicks to a 108-86 victory over the Orlando Magic at Madison Square Garden. Anthony scored 12 of his game-high 25 as part of a dominant 33-18 third quarter for the home team. Rookie guard  Iman Shumpert  added a career-high 25 points, while  Baron Davis  finished with 11 points, seven rebounds and six assists. Inside that 33-18 third quarter was a season-best 21-0 run. For the Magic,  Jameer Nelson  started hot with 11 points in the first quarter on his way to a team-high 17. QUOTABLE:  "He changes the game from a defensive standpoint. It didn't hurt him tonight that he had his jumpshot going ."  -- Knicks interim head coach  Mike Woodson  on Shumpert. THE STAT:  The Knicks thoroughly controlled the boards against one of the NBA's best big men in  Dwight Howard  to the tune of 49-34 for the game.  Tyson Chandler  hauled in a game-high nine rebounds, while rookie forward  Josh Harrellson  finished with eight. Howard, the NBA's leading rebounder entering the night at 14.7 per game, finished with just five. TURNING POINT:  After Howard pulled the Magic within two at 40-38 with 4:52 before halftime, the Knicks ripped off a 17-3 run to take a 57-41 lead into the locker room. Davis scored seven of his 11 points during the run, which was capped off by  Steve Novak  hitting a buzzer-beating 3-pointer. That trey gave Novak 13 points on his way to a 16-point night. HOT:  Shumpert came into Wednesday averaging just 6.4 points over his last five games, but exploded against the Magic. The Georgia Tech product scored 10 of his 25 points in the third quarter to help break the game open for good. In that third quarter, the Knicks led by as many as 39 on two separate occasions in the third. NOT:  The 21.1 points and NBA-leading 14.7 rebounds per game Howard averages help him live up to the his 'Superman' moniker, but in two meetings with the Knicks this season, he has been anything but super. After just eight points and 10 rebounds in a 102-93 win at MSG on Jan. 16, Howard managed just 12 points, five rebounds and played to a minus-29 rating. In two games against the Knicks, Howard has taken just 13 shots. QUOTABLE II:  "It's been a rocky season for us. A lot has been going on, a lot happened, but right now with the coaching change, we've been playing extremely well. We've been really locked in."   -- Anthony on a whirlwind few weeks that saw Woodson take over for  Mike D'Antoni  and now Stoudemire and Lin being sidelined. QUOTABLE III:  "They're double-teaming 'Melo and I haven't been shooting the ball much and I do shoot it, I haven't been shooting it well so they are leaving me open. I am going to get more shots and I have to step into it with confidence and knock them down."   -- Shumpert after he went 10-for-21 from the floor and 4-for-10 from 3-point range. INSIDE THE ARENA: Justin Tuck  and  Victor Cruz  of the New York Giants, comedian  Aziz Ansari  and actor  Jeremy Piven  watched the game courtside. NOTABLE:  The Magic entered the night fourth in the NBA in points allowed per game at 91.9. That stat did not hold true on Wednesday evening as they gave up 57 points in the first half and 108 for the game. The 108 points marked the 22nd time the Knicks have hit the century mark as they moved to 16-6 in those contests. Conversely, the Magic are now 4-6 when allowing 100 or more points. UP NEXT:  For the Knicks, Friday @ Atlanta, Saturday vs. Cleveland, Tuesday @ Indiana. For the Magic, Friday vs. Dallas, Sunday vs. Denver, Tuesday at Detroit.
