  Suns-Mavericks notebook   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Saturday December 18, 2010 12:49AM THE FACTS:  Sparked by super subs  Jason Terry  and  Shawn Marion , the Mavericks defeated the short-handed Suns 106-91 on Friday in Dallas for their 14th win in 15 games. Phoenix never contended after losing point guard  Steve Nash  to a stinger early in the first quarter, with Dallas outscoring the Suns by a 58-34 margin during the second and third quarters. Terry (18 points) and Marion (15) were joined in double figures by  Dirk Nowitzki  (18) and  Caron Butler  (17). QUOTABLE:  "It was a very, very unfortunate thing so both teams hope [Nash] is OK soon. After that, it was a weird game. Both teams were concerned, but we still had a job to do."    -- Dirk Nowitzki. THE STAT:  Dallas muzzled Phoenix's primary perimeter guns, with the Suns shooting 23.8 percent (5-for-21) from behind the arc.  Channing Frye , who buried seven 3-pointers in Wednesday's win against Minnesota, was 2-for-8 before fouling out with 3:50 to play.  Jason Richardson , who came in leading the NBA with 62 treys, finished 0-for-5 from downtown. TURNING POINT:  With the Mavericks up 11-10, Nash collided with Dallas center  Tyson Chandler  at midcourt while contending for a loose ball. Both players went down as Chandler tipped the ball ahead for a dunk by Butler. Nash, whose head crashed into Chandler's hip, stayed down as a timeout was called at the 7:17 mark. After a few minutes, he walked gingerly to the locker room and did not return, diagnosed with a stinger. Nash said he temporarily lost feeling in his arms and legs. X-rays were negative, but there is no timetable for his return. QUOTABLE II:  "Everything seems to be fine. I'm sure we'll get some more tests done and everything. But it's a little scary -- you fall on the floor and you don't have feeling in your hands and your legs and that can scare the heck out of you. But he seemed to have those back, but not 100 percent, so we'll just see how it all works out."    -- Phoenix head coach  Alvin Gentry  on Nash. HOT:  Reserves Marion and Terry combined for 26 of the Mavericks' 32 points in the second quarter. Marion scored 13 (5-for-7 FG) and tallied two rebounds in the period and Terry scored 13 (6-for-7 FG) with four assists. Both played the full 12 minutes as Dallas flipped a 25-22 first-quarter deficit into a 54-42 halftime advantage. NOT:  Phoenix came in ranked first in the NBA in scoring with 109.0 points per game, but scored only 17 in both the second and third quarters. The Suns shot 39.3 percent for the game and posted their second-lowest point total of the season (89 at Orlando on Nov. 18). FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Dallas centers Chandler (12) and  Brendan Haywood  (10) both reached double figures in rebounds. ... Two Suns posted double-doubles off the bench.  Goran Dragic  racked up 14 points and 10 assists in Nash's absence and  Hakim Warrick  contributed a team-high 15 points and 14 boards, tied with Frye for the game high. INSIDE THE ARENA:  The Arkansas men's basketball team, in town for a doubleheader here Saturday, attended the game. The Razorbacks (7-1) face Texas A&M (9-1) and Baylor (9-0) battles Gonzaga (5-5) in "The Showcase." NOTABLE:  The Mavericks are 14-0 when scoring 100 points or more this season. ...
