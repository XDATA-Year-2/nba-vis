  Kings-Spurs notebook   By Tim Price, for NBA.com Posted Thursday April 7, 2011 12:08AM THE FACTS:  For the fourth time in team history the Spurs have a 60-win season, and San Antonio now needs one more win or a Lakers loss to earn the top seed in the West after beating the Sacramento Kings 124-92 on Wednesday at AT&T Center. The Spurs (60-19) were led by  Manu Ginobili's  25 points on 10-of-16 shooting (4-of-6 from the 3-point line) in 28 and 1/2 minutes. Sacramento (23-55) had won six of eight coming into the game, and double-doubles from  DeMarcus Cousins  (15 points, 11 rebounds) and  Samuel Dalembert  (12 and 10) were not enough to keep the run going. QUOTABLE:  "I thought we had great focus tonight after a back-to-back, when one might think we would be a tired team. We have been concentrating on defense. We played very good defense and it fueled the offense you saw. That's where it all starts for us."   -- Spurs coach  Gregg Popovich THE STAT:  The Spurs scored a season-high 41 points to blow the game open in the third quarter. San Antonio shot 82 percent (14-of-17) in the quarter and had a 13-0 advantage in free throws (the Spurs made 10). TURNING POINT:  The game was tied two minutes into the second half, but the Spurs went on a 13-6 run to lead by seven points with 6:30 left in the third quarter. Big deal. The Spurs twice led by seven points before that and allowed the Kings to erase every bit of those leads on both occasions. There were 11 lead changes, in fact, and eight ties early in the third quarter. But with the Spurs starters still on the court, San Antonio came out of a timeout with a 68-61 lead and made six of their next seven shots plus 10 of 13 free throws (they had taken six up to that point) and finished off the third quarter with a 92-70 lead. QUOTABLE II:  "The Spurs are very good. When they got out and ran we didn't have too much defense for that. In the second half our defense wasn't very good, our offense wasn't very efficient, and they hit every shot. They just blew us out in the third quarter."   -- Kings coach  Paul Westphal HOT:  The Spurs pulled off wins on consecutive nights because of their starting backcourt. Last night in Atlanta,  Tony Parker  went 10-of-16 for 26 points. Ginobili finished it off tonight with the identical 10-of-16 effort. NOT:  It looked like  Marcus Thornton  had pulled himself out of a shooting slump last night in Houston when he went 9-of-16 for 21 points. But tonight he was 3-of-11, which fits right along with the 10-of-30 slate he produced in the two games prior to Houston. He did make a 3-pointer tonight, which snapped a three-game skid of going 0-of-10. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Both Cousins and Dalembert have double-doubles on consecutive nights. Cousins has a combined 30 points and 26 rebounds the past two nights and Dalembert had 33 points and 25 rebounds. GOOD MOVE:  It might have been tempting for Popovich to play the starters sparingly against the Kings on the second night of a back-to-back. But after the Kings took a timeout midway through the third quarter to regroup after falling behind by seven, Popovich kept the starters out there and got immediate results when Ginobili scored on a layup on a dish from Duncan, plus made the free throw after being fouled. Within the next two minutes Duncan had another assists and a blocked shot to keep the spurt going. ROOKIE WATCH:  Cousins was 7-of-11 and had three offensive rebounds, three assists, two blocked shots and no turnovers. NOTABLE:  The last time the Spurs won 60 games in a season was 2005-06. The 32-point margin of victory is the largest for the Spurs this season (they beat Miami by 30 on March 4 before being beaten by 30 in Miami 10 days later). The Spurs have won 12 in a row over Sacramento dating back to November 2007.  Matt Bonner  has a shiner under his left eye after bumping with his own teammate (Parker) while going for a rebound in the third quarter. UP NEXT:  For the Kings, Friday @ Memphis, Sunday @ Golden State, Monday vs. Oklahoma City. For the Spurs, Saturday vs. Utah, Tuesday @ Lakers, Wednesday @ Phoenix.
