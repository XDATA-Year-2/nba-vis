 THE FACT:  The Oklahoma City Thunder got 31 points from  Russell Westbrook  to beat the San Antonio Spurs 113-100 on the road. 
 
 THE LEAD : The Spurs were down by just three points early in the fourth quarter, but Westbrook and  Reggie Jackson  hit timely bucket after timely bucket to keep the Spurs at bay and escape the AT&T Center with a 113-100 win. 
 Westbrook paced the Thunder (22-4) with 31 points and eight assists for Oklahoma City, while  Kevin Durant  scored 17 points and Jackson came off the bench to score 21. On the night, the Thunder shot 48.9 percent from the floor and shot 12-for-27 on 3-pointers. 
 The Spurs (21-6) got 23 points eight assists from  Tony Parker  and 17 points apiece from  Marco Belinell i and  Tim Duncan , but were unable to get the stops they needed in the fourth quarter to beat the Thunder. San Antonio was out-rebounded 48-37. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "Our defense was good but I thought our offense was even better than our defense."  --  Thunder head coach  Scott Brooks 
 
 
 THE STAT : Oklahoma City scored 40 points in the second quarter on 16-for-23 shooting including 5-for-6 from 3-point range. 
 
 TURNING POINT: Boris Diaw  tipped in a  Tiago Splitter  miss to cut the Thunder lead to five points at 85-80 with 10:24 left in the fourth quarter and followed that up with a reverse layup after a nice feed from  Patty Mills  to cut the lead to three. After the San Antonio corralled a missed shot from Jackson,  Manu Ginobili  went the other way with the AT&T Center crowd on its feet, but Ginobili had his pass at the top of the key intercepted by Jackson, who went for an uncontested dunk that killed the Spurs' momentum. San Antonio trimmed the Thunder lead to three points again later in the game, but the damage was done. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "Our demise was the second quarter. We gave up 40 points." --  Spurs head coach  Gregg Popovich 
 
 
 HOT : Thunder point guards. Westbrook and Jackson combined to shoot 21-for-36 from the field en route to 52 points against the Spurs. 
 
 NOT : Belinelli's second half. After scoring 17 points and hitting five 3-pointers in the first two quarters, the Thunder held Belinelli scoreless in the second half. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Westbrook was the fantasy standout in this game, scoring 31 points on 13-for-22 shooting with two 3-pointers, eight assists and four rebounds. Durant scored 17 points on 6-for-14 shooting with two 3s, five abounds, three assists, two steals and a blocked shot.  Serge Ibaka  scored 14 points with two 3-pointers, 14 rebounds and three blocked shots. 
 For the Spurs, Parker scored 23 points on 6-for-14 shooting, eight assists and two steals, while Duncan scored 17 points on 7-for-14 shooting with 10 rebounds and two blocked shots. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH : Oklahoma City's  Steven Adams  scored four points and grabbed six rebounds in just under 19 minutes of playing time against the Spurs. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Oklahoma City takes a 2-0 lead in a season series that could have home court implications in the playoffs... Kawhi Leonard  missed the game after a dental procedure earlier in the day...The win is Oklahoma City's ninth in a row and 17th of its last 18 games 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Thunder, Sunday vs. Toronto, Wednesday @ New York, Friday @ Charlotte. For the Spurs, Monday vs. Toronto, Wednesday vs. Houston, Thursday @ Dallas.
