  Notebook: Hawks 92, Trail Blazers 89   By Matt Winkeljohn, for NBA.com Posted Thursday January 19, 2012 1:50AM THE FACTS: Jamal Crawford  traded teams and the former Hawk led the visiting Blazers with 22 points Wednesday night, but  Joe Johnson  scored 24 to lead Atlanta to a 92-89 win over Portland yet again.     The Hawks have won four straight games since losing All-Star center  Al Horford  to a torn pectoral muscle, and they've beaten the Blazers six straight times. Portland last beat Atlanta on Feb. 20, 2009.     It looked like Atlanta was going to run away with what had been a competitive game when  Josh Smith  scored six straight points for the Hawks to start a 14-0 run to end the third quarter. That gave Atlanta a 75-62 lead. Portland countered with a 13-0 run to start the fourth quarter, and Crawford's 3-pointer with 6:15 left in the game gave the Blazers a 78-77 lead. He scored nine points in that 16-2 run. Johnson hit a 15-foot jumper moments later, though, and the Hawks (11-4) never again lost the lead. Smith had 17 points, 11 rebounds, and three blocked shots.     LaMarcus Aldridge had 20 points and 11 rebounds for the Blazers, but missed two free throws with 1:02 left. Portland (8-6) has lost four of its last five games, and is 2-5 on the road. QUOTABLE:  "I think when Al went out, it just brought us tighter. We're going out there and getting it done."    -- Hawks point guard  Jeff Teague , who scored 13 points and is averaging 15.5 points and seven assists since Horford was injured. THE STAT:  The Blazers turned the ball over just nine times and took 21 more shots, but the Hawks made the visitors pay dearly for their terrible transition defense. Atlanta outscored Portland 22-10 in fast-break points. TURNING POINT:  The Blazers trailed 84-80 with about 1:34 left when  Wes Matthews  intercepted a long, ill-advised pass by Josh Smith and took off. Joe Johnson snuck up behind Matthews near mid-court, however, plucked the ball away, and then threw an alley-oop to Teague for an 86-80 lead with 1:25 left. Portland was unable to overcome that and Aldridge's two missed free throws 23 seconds later sealed it. QUOTABLE II:  "We kept calling timeouts so we could get the best possible lineup on the floor for every situation. We're not playing as well as we can right now on both ends."    -- Blazers coach  Nate McMillan HOT:  Joe Johnson shot 8-for-13 after an 0-for-6 start. He's averaged 24.8 points and 5.5 assists since Horford's injury. ... Crawford was just 2-for-9 through three quarters before going 6-for-13 for 14 points in the fourth period. ... Josh Smith has averaged 20.8 points and 11.8 rebounds in the four games since Horford went out. ... Atlanta reserves  Tracy McGrady, Zaza Pachulia, Jannero Pargo, Willie Green  and  Ivan Johnson  were a combined 10-for-12 for 23 points in the first half, which the Hawks led 51-42. ...  Marvin Williams  had all eight of his rebounds in the first half for the Hawks. ... NOT:  Portland's Matthews was 2-for-13. That makes him 6-for-31 over the past three games. He did have five steals Wednesday. ...  Jason Collins  started at center for the second consecutive game for Atlanta, and for the second straight game he went scoreless with one rebound. NOTABLE:  Blazers reserve forward  Nicolas Batum  did not return after being poked in the eye in the second quarter. McMillan said his prognosis was unknown. IN THE ARENA:  Actors  Ben Stiller  and  Vince Vaughn , in Atlanta to film a movie, were in the crowd. ...  Trevor Bayne , who last February became the youngest Daytona 500 winner at age 20, was at the game. Earlier in the day, he shot some hoops with Hawks legend/announcer  Dominique Wilkins . UP NEXT:  For the Blazers, Friday @ Toronto, Saturday @ Detroit, Monday vs. Sacramento. For the Hawks, Friday @ Philadelphia, Saturday vs. Cleveland, Monday @ Milwaukee.
