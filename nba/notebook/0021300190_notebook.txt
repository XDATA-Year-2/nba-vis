 THE FACT:   Former Hawk  Jordan Crawford  scored 10 of his 12 points in the fourth quarter, when the Celtics outscored the suddenly-cold Hawks by 17 points for a 94-87 comeback win in Atlanta. Boston snapped a six-game losing streak. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Both teams were playing for the second time in as many nights, but only the Hawks (8-6) looked worn out down the stretch as the Celtics (5-10) broke out of a six-game losing funk by outworking Atlanta in the final quarter. Boston went 24-for-31 on free throws on a night when the Hawks shot 10-for-12 from the line.  
 The Celtics, particularly, Crawford were in attack mode late. 
 The visitors outscored the Hawks 8-2 in the paint in the final period, when Atlanta shot 1-for-8 from within the lane, after Boston was outscored 42-24 there over the first three quarters. When Boston didn't convert close, the Celtics often ended up at the line for easy points anyway. Atlanta shot 5-for-23 (21.7 percent) in the fourth quarter while being outscored 30-13. 
 With center  Kelly Olnyk  (right ankle) out, Boston's  Jared Sullinger  slid to the pivot and had 15  points and a game-high nine rebounds as the Celtics won 47-38 on the boards.  Brandon Bass , who moved into Sullinger's power forward spot, led Boston with 17 points, and Crawford tied his season high with 10 assists. 
 Hawks center  Al Horford  scored 18 points, and point guard  Jeff Teague  put up his seventh double-double with 13 points and 10 assists. He shot just 3-for-15, however, and missed all four of his shots in the fourth quarter.  
 Crawford shot 3-for-5 in the fourth after missing his first four shots, and all of his makes were aggressive --  two drives to the rim and a teardrop runner with 58 seconds left for a 90-85 lead. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "He really wanted the ball in those moments, and I thought it was the best thing to get it to him. After he made the first couple of moves, the guys came back to the huddle and said, 'put it in his hands.' Maybe it will be somebody else some other night, but tonight it was him." 
 -- Celtics coach  Brad Stevens , speaking about Crawford. 
 
 THE STAT:   11-2: Boston loved the free-throw line late, as the Celtics shot 11-for-14 in the fourth quarter while the Hawks shot 2-for-2. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Hawks led 81-70 after a  Mike Scott  trey with 9:30 left in the game, but then missed their next 10 shots as Boston scored 10 straight points as part of a 24-6 run to close the game.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I think the free-throw line and the aggressiveness of Boston in the fourth quarter was the difference in the game. We need to be more aggressive. We need to get to the paint. We need to get to the basket. We need to get to the free-throw line." 
 -- Hawks coach  Mike Budenholzer 
 
 
 HOT:   Celtics guard  Avery Bradley  scored 10 of his 12 points in the first quarter. . .  Bass made all six of his free throws in the fourth quarter.  
 
 NOT:   Atlanta reserve big man  Pero Antic  shot just 1-for-8 one night after missing all five of his shots in Detroit. . . .  DeMarre Carroll  missed all four of his 3-point shots and has made just 2-for-13 in the past three games for the Hawks.  
 
 NOTABLE: Kyle Korver   has made at least one 3-point shot in 87 consecutive games, two shy of  Dana Barros ' NBA record of 89. He didn't waste much time Saturday. He drained a trey just 1:47 into the game. It was his only one. He shot 1-for-2, and is shooting 53.5 percent from distance this season (37-for-70). 
 
 UP NEXT:   For the Celtics, Monday @ Charlotte, Wednesday vs. Memphis, Friday vs. Cleveland. For the Hawks, Tuesday vs. Orlando, Wednesday @ Houston, Friday vs. Dallas.
