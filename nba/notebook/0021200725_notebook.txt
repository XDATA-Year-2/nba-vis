 THE FACTS: Jeff Teague  had 22 points and a season-high 13 assists Wednesday to help the Hawks snap a two-game losing streak with a 103-92 win over the visiting Grizzlies. 
    He had plenty of help, as  Josh Smith  (19 points, 11 rebounds, six assists, three blocked shots) and  Al Horford  (17 points, 11 rebounds) more than held their own against the Memphis backline of  Zach Randolph  and  Marc Gasol.  Randolph led Memphis with 20 points and seven rebounds, but he scored eight in the fourth quarter by which time the game was lopsided. The Hawks also outrebounded the Grizzlies 46-38. 
    Randolph's short hook shot with 10:47 left in the second quarter tied the game at 26, but Atlanta (27-21) then went on a 17-7 run, and the Grizzlies never came closer than seven points from then on. They trailed by 23 in the third quarter. The Hawks shot a season-best 62.2 percent (23-for-37) in the first half on the way to a 58-48 lead against the NBA's stingiest defense. Memphis (30-18) lost its second straight game, and fell for the eighth time in 14 games after a 24-10 start. Memphis newcomers  Tayshaun Prince  (six points),  Austin Daye  (three) and  Ed Davis  (two, six rebounds) hardly influenced the game. 
     Atlanta shot 51.4 percent overall, and went 10-for-24 on 3-pointers as  Kyle Korver  shot 2-for-5 from distance on the way to 12 points. He tied the franchise record and set a personal record by making at least one trey in his 42nd straight game. Former Hawks point guard  Mookie Blaylock  did that from 1996-97. 
 
 QUOTABLE :  "We were clicking on all cylinders. Al [Horford] was getting out and running, getting rebounds. Josh [Smith] was getting out and leading the breaks, and guys were making shots." 
 -- Jeff Teague 
 
 THE STAT : +5 -- Both teams made 38 shots from the field, but the Hawks took twice as many 3-pointers as the Grizzlies (24 to 12), and made twice as many, too (10 to 5).  
 
 TURNING POINT :  After Randolph's hook tied the game early in the second quarter for the last time, Atlanta's 17-7 run was fueled by four made 3-pointers. Rookie  John Jenkins  made two, Korver one and Teague one. Four different Hawks made at least two treys, including  Anthony Tolliver  in just his second start of the season, at small forward. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "We weren't playing our game. They ran at us every time, and they put a lot of pressure on the ball. It hurts even more to get beat at your own game, and get outworked.  . . . Obviously, we're struggling a little bit right now, but we're going to fight and figure it out." 
 -- Marc Gasol 
 
 HOT : In his past two games. Teague has scored 24 and 22 points, respectively, on a combined 16-for-27 shooting. That includes 3-for-4 on 3-pointers. He also had a combined 21 assists in those game. . . . Memphis guard  Jerryd Bayless  scored 15 points, and his averaging 19.8 over the past five games. His season average is up to 7.0.  
 
 NOT : Grizzlies sub  Darrell Arthur  shot 1-for-6 off the bench and, over the past two games, he's just 2-for-16. . . . Gasol is 6-for-21 over the past two contests.  
 
 GOOD MOVE :  With  DeShawn Stevenson  (knees) unavailable, Hawks coach  Larry Drew  moved Korver from small forward to shooting guard and gave Tolliver his second start of the season. He had eight points, a season-high seven rebounds and blocked a shot. Tolliver helped keep Prince (six points, two rebounds) in check. 
 
 QUOTABLE III : "From the very first day in training camp, he did things that really intrigued our staff defensively with how he was always in the right spots. From a matchup standpoint . . . [Prince's] size has bothered Kyle [Korver] in the past so I elected to go with Tolliver and I thought he did an exceptional job." 
 -- Larry Drew 
 
 IN THE ARENA : Tauheed Epps, aka rapper "2 Chainz," was in the house. 
 
 ROOKIE REPORT : Jenkins, the Atlanta rookie guard who grew up in Nashville, continues to make use of his expanded playing time. He shot a young career-best 3-for-6 on 3-pointers for nine points, and added five rebounds.  
 
 NOTABLE : Hawks reserve center  Zaza Pachulia  missed his fourth straight game with a sore right Achilles' tendon. Drew said he is "day-to-day." . . . The Hawks are 10-2 when Horford and Smith each have double-doubles. . . .   
 
 UP NEXT : For the Grizzlies, Friday vs. Golden State, Sunday vs. Minnesota, Tuesday vs. Sacramento. For the Hawks, Friday vs. New Orleans, Monday @ Dallas, Wednesday @ Orlando.
