 THE FACTS:   Avery Bradley  scored a season-high 22 points,  Paul Pierce  and  Kevin Garnett  scored 18 points each and the Boston Celtics defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 109-101 Tuesday night at the Wells Fargo Center.  Jeff Green  added 16 points and  Jordan Crawford  contributed 12 more off the bench. The Celtics won their third in a row and improved to 32-27. 
 
 Thaddeus Young  paced the Sixers with 19 points and 10 rebounds while  Evan Turner  and  Jrue Holiday  scored 18 points apiece.  Spencer Hawes  added 14 while  Royal Ivey ,  Dorell Wright  and rookie  Arnett Moultrie  had 10 each. The Sixers fell to 17-16 at the Wells Fargo Center and 23-36 overall. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It's amazing we turned it over and won." 
 -- Celtics coach  Doc Rivers , on winning despite committing 22 turnovers. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Celtics shot 50.6 percent from the field. When the opposition shoots 50 percent or better, the Sixers are now 0-14 this season. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Sixers crept within 79-74 after three quarters following a 6-0 run to close the quarter. But the Celtics responded with a 9-0 run to open the fourth, extending their advantage to 88-74. It was the sign of a veteran team and it was enough of a cushion to withstand a late run by Philadelphia. 
 
 HOT:  Bradley knocked down nine of his first 10 shots and wound up 10-for-15. Garnett was 9-for-17 while Pierce was very effective, going 6-for-10. 
 
 NOT:  Turner was 6-for-19, Holiday was 6-for-17 and Wright missed 10 of his 13 shots. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "My teammates have confidence in me. I have to have confidence in myself and if I have open shots, I have to take them." 
 -- Bradley 
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Pierce had a terrific all-around game with 18 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists. Bradley was also stellar with 22 points, seven rebounds, five assists and one steal. Holiday had 18 points, 10 assists, five rebounds and four steals for the Sixers. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  Though the Sixers have been struggling, there was still a major buzz inside the arena for this rivalry matchup against the Celtics. Former Pennsylvania Governor  Ed Rendell  attended the game. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "It's frustrating to lose. Our effort was there. We communicated well. It was the little stuff that hurt us." 
 -- Turner 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Rivers kept his players fresh with a steady stream of substitutions. Rivers was able to limit Pierce's minutes and the bench responded in a big way with 41 points. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Sixers took too many 3-pointers (5-for-21) and probably could have penetrated to the basket more. They were 14-for-18 from the free throw line. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Celtics center  Fab Melo  was assigned to the D-League while forward  Jared Sullinger  is out for the season following lumbar disc surgery. For the Sixers, Moultrie was solid with 10 points. Over the past four games, he is 12-for-12 from the field. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Sixers guard  Nick Young  missed his third straight game with a sprained left ankle. ... Bradley reached the 20-point plateau for the sixth time in his career. ...  Thaddeus Young  recorded his third double-double over the past six games and his 15th of the season. He had one double-double all of last season. ... The Sixers tied their season high with 14 steals. ... The Sixers are 4-17 when allowing 100 or more points. ... All five Philadelphia starters reached double figures in scoring for just the second time this season. ... The Celtics led by as many as 15 points. ... The Celtics are 18-4 when scoring 100 or more points. ... The Sixers have forced 20 or more turnovers in two of the past three games. 
 
 NEXT:  For the Celtics, Wednesday @ Indiana, Friday vs. Atlanta, Sunday @ Oklahoma City. For the Sixers, Wednesday @ Atlanta, Friday @ Miami, Sunday @ Orlando.
