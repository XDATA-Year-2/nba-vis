 THE FACTS : The Oklahoma City Thunder had no trouble handling the Sacramento Kings Friday night on their home floor, winning 105-95. 
 
 Kevin Durant  led the way for the Thunder (34-10) with 24 points, 11 rebounds and five assists.   Russell Westbrook  added 18 points and 14 assists, while  Kevin Martin  finished with 24 points off the bench against his former team. 
 
 DeMarcus Cousins  scored 14 points and grabbed eight rebounds, but shot 6-for-16 from the field in the loss for the Kings (16-28).    Tyreke Evans  scored a team-high 16 on 6-for-11 shooting, while Marcus Thornton kicked in 13 points off the bench. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "I know these rims well.  I've had some great times in this arena."       
 -- Kevin Martin on his big night against his former team 
 
 THE STAT : Westbrook finished with 14 assists in 32 minutes of action.  The entire Kings team finished with 15 total assists on the night. 
 
 TURNING POINT : After an entertaining and competitive first half, the Kings forgot to come out of the locker room in the third quarter and the Thunder ran them out of the gym.   
 
 QUOTABLE II : "That's how we play.  We're an aggressive team.  We play for each other and I thought that was really good, maybe one of our best quarters of the year in that third quarter"  
 -- Thunder coach  Scott Brooks  on his teams stellar third quarter 
 
 HOT : Sacramento got off to an early lead in this one, but the former Kings' player Martin came off the Thunder bench hot, scoring 15 points on 5-for-10 shooting before the break. Martin finished with 24 points in 34 minutes in the win.  
 
 NOT: Jimmer Fredette  missed his first six shots before hitting two 3-pointers late in the game.  He finished with six points on 2-for-8 shooting. 
 
 GOOD MOVE : Whatever the Thunder's Brooks said to his team at halftime, it worked.  The Thunder came out in the third and destroyed the Kings' starting unit.   
 
 NOTABLE : More than 15,000 fans were in attendance tonight in Sleep Train Arena, including mayor and former Suns player  Kevin Johnson  who is fighting to keep the team in Sacramento.   
 
 UP NEXT : For the Thunder, Sunday @ Lakers, Thursday vs. Memphis, Saturday @ Cavaliers.  For the Kings, Saturday @ Denver, Monday @ Wizards, Wednesday @ Boston.
