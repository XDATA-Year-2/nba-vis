  Warriors-Hawks notebook   By Jon Cooper, for NBA.com  Posted Thursday December 30, 2010 12:27AM THE FACTS:  The Atlanta Hawks ended 2010 with their fourth win in five games and ninth straight home win, knocking off the Golden State Warriors, 103-93, Wednesday night at Philips Arena.  Josh Smith  led the Hawks with 22 points (he also grabbed 10 rebounds), and  Al Horford  added 21 and a game-high 15 rebounds for Atlanta. The Hawks took advantage of the depleted Golden State front court, holding a 44-34 edge in points in the paint, while frustrating the Warriors' high-octane back court of  Monta Ellis  and  Stephen Curry , who totaled 21 points.  Dorell Wright  scored a game- and career-high 32 for the Warriors, who saw their modest three-game winning streak snapped in their first of a five-game East Coast swing. QUOTABLE:  "We knew going into the game we were going to have our hands full, especially in the backcourt with Curry and Ellis. But we did a good job on them. We contested a lot of their shots. Dorell Wright made some shots. Sometimes you have to give up something to get something."    ? Hawks Head Coach Larry Drew.  THE STAT: 8-for-24: Golden State's shooting from three-point range. The Warriors, who came into the game with the second best three-point attack in the League (40.1 percent), shot only 33.3 from behind the arc. Of the eight makes, four of them came from Wright. Take Wright out of the equation and Golden State shot only 26.7 percent (4-of-15 (26.7). This from a team that has shot 40.0 percent or better 16 times, 50.0 or better nine times. TURNING POINT:  Former Warrior  Jamal Crawford's  lone basket of the first quarter, a three-pointer with 1.6 seconds left, gave Atlanta its first lead of the game, 29-27. They would never trail or even be tied again. The Hawks springboarding off the shot, opening the second quarter on a 10-0 run, and really set the tone, as all 10 points came on lay-ups or short shots in the paint. QUOTABLE II:  "It was important for me to pick up for those guys. I was hot. They kept going to me and they kept finding me."    ?  Dorell Wright,  who shot 13-for-21, 4-for-9 from three, on stepping up for Ellis and Curry.  HOT:  Wright was absolutely sizzling from the end of the first quarter through the beginning of the fourth. His 14-foot jumper with :50 remaining in the first quarter began a stretch of 27:22 in which he didn't miss a shot. He went 9-for-9 in that time, 3-for-3 from three. Wright finally missed a four-foot floater at the 9:28 mark of the fourth quarter. He proceeded to tap in the rebound. NOT:  Monta Ellis and Stephen Curry: At the other end of the spectrum from Wright were Ellis and Curry. The duo shot 8-for-26 for the game (30.8 percent), and were 2-for-7 from three (28.6). During Wright's torrid run, the duo was a combined 1-for-12, 0-for-3 from three (although one of those was a desperation heave by Ellis at the end of the first quarter). Ellis, the reigning Western Conference Player of the Week (39.7 ppg), and Curry were averaging 45.1 points per game. The mitigating factor for Curry was that he dished out a game-high 12 assists. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT: Joe Johnson  isn't scoring like Joe Johnson, but he's certainly not hurting his team or any fantasy team he's on. Johnson scored 16 points, on 6-for-14 shooting (2-for 5 from three), while dishing out a team-high eight assists.  ROOKIE WATCH:  The only first-year player to get on the floor was Golden State center Ekpe Udoh. He saw 5:38, all in the second quarter. In that time, he scored two points (both on free throws, where he was 2-for-2). He was 0-for-2 from the floor, but was active on the offensive glass, pulling down two of his three total rebounds on the offensive end. He had positive time in the game, as he entered with the Warriors down nine (36-27) and left with them down six (41-35).  NOTABLE : Joe Johnson's driving layup with 3:54 remaining in the first quarter moved him past Hall of Famer Lenny Wilkens and into 10th place all-time in Hawks scoring...Marvin Williams left the game with a lower back injury, incurred when he tumbled over Warriors forward  Lou Amundson  with 6:01 remaining in the third quarter...The 93 points scored by the Warriors marked only the fifth time in 13 December games, and the first time in the last five, that they were held under 100 points. They are 1-4 in those games...Mike Bibby scored 10 points on 4-for-5 shooting (2-for-3 from three) in a 6:26 stretch of the third quarter after going scoreless and shooting 0-for-3 (0-for-2 from three) in the first half...Ellis' 12 points were his lowest output since Nov. 30, against San Antonio, when he, fittingly, had 12...Former Hawk  Dikembe Mutombo  held court in the Atlanta locker room after the game. UP NEXT:  For the Hawks, Friday @ Oklahoma City, Sunday @ L.A. Clippers, Tuesday @ Sacramento. For the Warriors, Friday @ Charlotte, Saturday @ Miami, Monday @ Orlando.
