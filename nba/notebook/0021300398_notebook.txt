 THE FACT: Khris Middleton  scored 20 of his 27 points in the second half as the Bucks ended a five-game losing streak. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Khris Middleton's 27 points led three players with 21 or more points as the Milwaukee Bucks scored a season-high in a 116-106 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers Saturday night at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. 
 
 Caron Butler  had 22 points and 11 rebounds in his first game back after missing 12 games with a sore knee, and  Brandon Knight  added 21 points as Milwaukee (6-21)  ended a five-game slide. 
 
 Thaddeus Young  scored 30 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to lead Philadelphia (8-20). 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I was able to find open spots and my teammates were able to find me and make it happen. We just ran our offense and got what we wanted." 
 -- Khris Middleton 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Bucks made 23 of 25 free throws, going 10-for-10 in the final 51.9 seconds. The first two of those final 10 were from 19-year-old rookie  Giannis Antetokounmpo , who looked like a seasoned veteran with the pressure on after Philadelphia had cut a 19-point lead down to 106-99. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Milwaukee missed its first three shots of the third quarter, and the Sixers scored eight straight to trim a 59-49 deficit down to two points. From there, Middleton made the next three Milwaukee shots and started a streak in which he went 5-for-5 and the Bucks went 9-for-9. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I don't feel like I'm scared or stressed out for that moment. I just went up there and was cool, I focused and I made them." 
 -- Giannis Antetokounmpo on making free throws at crunch time 
 
 
 HOT:  Middleton was 11-for-15, hitting all 10 of his 2-point attempts. 
 
 NOT:  Sixers forward  Evan Turner  was just 2-for-15 from the field, and swingman  James Anderson  went 0-for-7. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Although they weren't in the game down the stretch, the Sixers had three players post strong double-doubles: Young had 30 points and 10 rebounds, center  Spencer Hawes  had 25 points and 11 rebounds and rookie point guard  Michael Carter-Williams  had 19 points and 12 assists.  
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  Milwaukee Brewers general manager  Doug Melvin  was in the stands. Also  Sal Bando , a third baseman for the great Oakland A's teams of the early '70s, and later a Brewers player (1977-'81) and Brewers general manager in the late '80s and early '90s, was in the house. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  With second-year forward/center  John Henson  out with a sore knee from a collision Friday night, Bucks coach  Larry Drew  relied heavily on Serbian rookie  Miroslav Raduljica , who scored 14 points and added four rebounds in 21 minutes. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Antetokounmpo started his third straight game and posted 12 points, seven rebounds, three assists and two blocked shots.   
 
 NOTABLE:  Raduljica scored a career-high 12 points a week earlier and then eclipsed it with his 14 in this game. "I love Saturday nights ... if you know what I mean," he said. ... Middleton's 27 points were two shy of his career high set earlier this season. He now has four career games of 20 or more points, all this season. ... Both teams were coming off an overtime game Friday night. ... Drew said before the game that guard  Gary Neal  was available after missing time with plantar fasciitis, but Neal did not play. ... Drew did not have any information on Henson's status for Monday's game at Charlotte. The Bucks were calling the injury a bruised knee. ... After having eight turnovers in a double-overtime loss to New York on Wednesday, Knight has not had a turnover in his last two games. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the 76ers, Saturday @ Phoenix, Dec. 29 @ Los Angeles Lakers, Jan. 1 @ Denver. For the Bucks, Monday @ Charlotte, Friday @ Brooklyn, Saturday vs. Minnesota.
