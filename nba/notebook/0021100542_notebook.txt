  Notebook: Grizzlies 100, Pistons 83 Posted Sunday March 4, 2012 12:19AM By Ron Higgins for NBA.com THE FACTS:  Suffocating defense, unexpectedly accurate three-point shooting and balanced scoring pushed the Memphis Grizzlies to a 100-83 victory over the Detroit Pistons at FedExForum Saturday night. The Grizzlies had a season-high seven players in double figures, led by 17 points each from center  Marc Gasol  and reserve guard  O.J. Mayo . The Grizzlies, now a season-best seven games over .500 at 22-15, won for the fourth straight time. They are also 10-2 in their last 12 games, a stretch they haven't had since Nov. 12 to Dec. 6, 2005. Detroit (12-26), which led 78-76 with 8:10 left to play before completely collapsing, was led by guards  Rodney Stuckey  and  Brandon Knight  with 20 and 15 points respectively. QUOTABLE:  "When I see that, I know I did my job."   -- Guard  Mike Conley , who had 10 points, 12 assists and 4 steals, on the Grizzlies having seven players score in double figures. THE STAT:  The Grizzlies, not exactly the NBA's most feared outside sharpshooters ranking 22nd in the league in three-point percentage, made just 1-of-5 threes in first three quarters vs. the Pistons. Then in the final period, Memphis had three different players combine to nail 5-of-6 threes. TURNING POINT:  Trailing 78-76 with 8:10 left to play, the Grizzlies went on a 17-0 run in the next 5:40 to take a 15-point lead heading into the game's final 2:30. During that stretch, the Pistons went 0-for-6 from the field and committed five turnovers, including two shot clock violations. Almost half of the Grizzlies' 31 points in the quarter came off five three-pointers with reserves  Quincy Pondexter  and Mayo scoring 10 and 9 points respectively. "Our defense was just awesome (in the fourth quarter)," Grizzlies' coach  Lionel Hollins  said. "We switched, we challenged shots, we got steals. Our energy just rose. We just exploded in that stretch." QUOTABLE II:  "They're just a defense-first team. They're always going for steals, always helping each other and always trying to make sure they get stops."   -- Piston guard Knight on the Grizzlies' scrambling team defense. HOT:  Mayo, the Grizzlies' biggest three-point threat with the deepest range, hit 4-of-5 threes including 3-for-3 in the fourth quarter. One of them was right in the mug of Detroit 6-10 forward  Jonas Jerebko  and Mayo's final three of the night was a catch-and-launch 26-footer that beat the shot clock. "That's my favorite shot, a straight-on three," Mayo said. NOT:  Detroit's bench could have stayed home, because it took the night off. The Pistons, which played four reserves substantially (and three more in the game's final 72 seconds) got outscored by the Grizzlies' four-deep bench 31-11. The Memphis bench scored 21 points in the fourth quarter. NOTABLE:  With the win, Memphis is now 121-119 since Hollins was hired as head coach on Jan. 25, 2009. ... The Grizzlies are 11-0 this season when scoring 100 or more points. ... Memphis has won five straight over the Pistons, the longest ever winning streak in the series for the Grizzlies. The Grizzlies are now 5-0 against Eastern Conference teams this season while Detroit is 0-4 vs. the West. UP NEXT:  For the Grizzlies, Wednesday at Golden State, Saturday at Phoenix, next Sunday at Denver. For the Pistons, home games Tuesday vs. the Lakers, Friday vs. Atlanta and Saturday vs. Toronto.
