 THE FACT:   Kevin Love  scored 16 points in the first quarter, but just nine the rest of the way in the Minnesota Timberwolves' 104-100 loss to the Washington Wizards.  
 
 THE LEAD: Bradley Beal  had 25 points, 17 in the second half,  John Wall  had 14 points and tied a career high with 16 assists to help the Wizards break their four-game losing streak. 
 Minnesota led by 16 in the first half and by 13 at halftime, but Washington outscored the Timberwolves 30-18 in the third quarter.  
 
 Martel Webster  hit a 3-pointer with 42.9 seconds left to give the Wizards the lead. 
 Love had 25 points and 11 rebounds to lead the Timberwolves.  Kevin Martin  was held to 11 points. In Minnesota's first 11 games, Martin was averaging 24.4. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I thought he was going for 70 in the first eight minutes." 
 -- Washington coach  Randy Wittman  on Love's hot start 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Love made five of his first six shots, then missed eight of his last 11. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Wizards outscored the Timberwolves 18-7 to begin the third quarter to get back into the game.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I just thought we were very impatient with what we were trying to do. I thought everybody was trying to make the home run play, trying to win the play in one possession and not make you guard us." 
 -- Minnesota coach  Rick Adelman  on his team's lackluster play 
 
 
 HOT:  Washington's  Marcin Gortat  shot 7-for-10 to finish with 14 quiet points. 
 
 NOT:  Martin missed 13 of his 17 shots.   
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Wizards came out in the second half with a fury and snatched the game away. "In the first half, we were horrible. We weren't there defensively. We were lackadaisical. We played with no energy," Beal said.  
 
 BAD MOVE:   Minnesota let Washington run on them in the second half. "Our transition D was poor. That's the only way they scored the ball really. I thought we did a good job in the half court, but everyone knows, when that team gets out in transition they can be pretty good offensively," Love said. 
 
 NOTABLE:   Webster had six field goals, five of them on 3-pointers.   
 
 IN THE ARENA:  F lip Saunders  returned to Washington for the first time since he was fired as Wizards coach in Jan. 2012. Saunders is now Minnesota's president of basketball operations. 
 
 UP NEXT:   For the Timberwolves: Tuesday vs. L.A. Clippers, Thursday vs. Brooklyn, Friday at Houston. For the Wizards: Wednesday at Cleveland, Friday at Toronto, Saturday vs. New York.
