  Notebook: Hawks 139, Jazz 133 Posted Sunday March 25, 2012 11:22PM By Matt Winkeljohn, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  It took a while -- a long, long, long, long while -- but the Jazz finally fell Sunday in Atlanta. That Utah's six-game winning streak ended in Atlanta was less amazing than the fact the Hawks didn't fall out before winning the NBA's first four-overtime game in nearly 15 years by outlasting Utah 139-133 in a game that generated remarkable numbers. Playing their third game in three days, and fourth in five days (including an overtime victory Wednesday against the Cavaliers, the Hawks leaned early and late on All-Star guard  Joe Johnson. He played 55:23, including the final 27:03, hit all eight of his shots in an 18-point first quarter, hit a step-back 3-pointer with 8 seconds left to force the third overtime, scored 16 points in the four overtimes, hit a 21-foot jumper in the final overtime to give the Hawks the lead for good, and scored eight points in the that fourth overtime -- including what essentially the last nail in the Jazz when he hit a 20-foot fade away jumper with 16 seconds left for a 135-131 lead. He finished with a game-high 37 points. Josh Smith  had 22 points, 10 rebounds and six assists for the Hawks before fouling out. Utah lost three starters to fouls:  Al Jefferson  (28 points, 17 rebounds),  Paul Millsap  (25 points, 13 rebounds) and  C.J. Miles  (17 points). Atlanta led 55-40 at halftime, but had to work extremely hard for its fourth straight win after the Jazz went on a 34-20 tear in the third quarter and eventually forced overtime. Hawks center  Zaza Pachulia  scored 15 points and grabbed a career-high 20 rebounds in the NBA's first four-overtime game since Portland and Phoenix locked up on Nov. 14, 1997. It was the second four-overtime game in Hawks franchise history and the first for the Jazz. The teams combined for 233 shots, 82 free throws, 128 rebounds and yet just 20 assists (nine by Utah, 11 by Atlanta). Each team scored just two points in the first overtime, both teams had 64 rebounds, both teams made six 3-pointers, Utah made 49 shots to Atlanta's 48, but the Hawks were 37-of-47 at the free throw line, where the Jazz were 29-of-35. And Johnson said he wasn't tired, not even after the Hawks returned in the week hours of Sunday morning from Saturday's win in Washington. QUOTABLE:  "It's not really that exhausting like people would think. I know it's our third [game] in a row, but winning cures everything. The more you win . . . you tend not to hurt as much."  --  Johnson. QUOTABLE II:  "It figures it would happen on the third game. It just shows the resilience and the toughness of this ball club. I think we will appreciate this win more than any other win during the season."  --  Josh Smith. THE STAT:  The Jazz entered the game fifth in the NBA in bench scoring (36.5 per game), but the Hawks' reserves out-scored Utah's subs 35-33, and out-rebounded the Jazz bench 17-14. The key? Former starter  Marvin Williams  -- who picked up a big chunk of his 45:32 in playing time after Smith fouled out with 1:57 left in the first overtime -- had 16 points and nine rebounds. TURNING POINT:  The Jazz took the final shot in regulation (Millsap missed an 11-footer), the first overtime ( Devin Harris  missed a turnaround 3-pointer), the second overtime (Harris missed a turnaround 19-footer), and the last two in the third overtime (Jefferson missed a 10-foot hook and Millsap missed an 18-footer). That's four shots to win, none made. QUOTABLE II:  "Tough loss. We had a lot of opportunities to win it . . . just didn't make the timely shots. It was a great game to be a part of; it would have been a greater game to win it."  --  Utah head coach  Tyrone Corbin. HOT:  Johnson, whose very late 3-pointer was the difference in Atlanta's win in Washington Saturday night, picked up where he left off with that 18-point first quarter. . . . Smith had five points, five rebounds and five assists in the first quarter. He has scored 20 or more points in four straight games (all wins), averaging 26.0. . . . Utah made 15-of-23 shots in the third quarter, and out-rebounded Atlanta 11-5 in the period to pull within a point. Millsap had 11 points, five rebounds, three assists and a steal in the frame. . . . Atlanta's Williams has made 15-of-27 shots in three games since he was sideline by a hip flexor. . . . Jefferson has averaged 25.7 points over the past three games. . . . NOT:  The Jazz made just 5-of-20 shots in the second quarter. . . . The first overtime was brutal. Each team made just 1-of-8 shots. . . .  Tracy McGrady  was in uniform for Atlanta, but did not play. He did not make the trip to Washington Saturday as part of a plan to rest his legs in the middle of back-to-back-to-back games. He did not score in his two games prior to that. . . . NOTABLE:  Atlanta's  Willie Green , who scored a combined six points in his first three games back after missing 11 with back and hamstring problems, scored 10 Sunday -- including a 3-pointer early in the final overtime period to push the Hawks' lead to 128-123. Green played the final two-and-a-half overtimes in place of  Kirk Hinrich , who told head coach  Larry Drew  that his leg was bothering him. . . . Atlanta's  Vladimir Radmanovic  and  Jerry Stackhouse  did not play. Utah's  Raja Bell  was not in uniform again. . . . Hayward played 57:28 and tied his career highs with eight rebounds (set Tuesday against Oklahoma City) free throws attempted (11) and made (10). UP NEXT:  For the Jazz, Monday @ Nets, Wednesday @ Celtics, Friday vs. Kings. For the Hawks, Tuesday @ Bucks, Wednesday vs. Bulls, Friday vs. Knicks.
