  Notebook: Pacers 125, Bucks 104 Posted Sunday March 25, 2012 12:29AM By Rick Braun, for NBA.com THE FACTS: George Hill  scored a season-high 24 points to lead a huge bench effort as the Indiana Pacers ripped the Milwaukee Bucks 125-104 Saturday night at the Bradley Center. Both teams were playing their third game in three nights, but the Pacers (28-19) clearly played with more energy. Center  Roy Hibbert  added 16 points and nine rebounds, and forwards  Danny Grainger  and  David West  had 15 each as the Pacers shot 51.2 percent (43 for 84). Ersan Ilyasova  led the Bucks (22-26) with 22 points and eight rebounds. QUOTABLE:  "It was an energy game and they had all of it. They were around the rim, they were in the paint, they were making multiple efforts. We just had difficulty competing with their energy."    -- Bucks coach  Scott Skiles THE STAT:  In an energy game, the Pacers won all of the "hustle board" statistics with a 49-37 edge in rebounds, a 9-4 margin in steals and a 5-3 advantage in blocked shots. TURNING POINT:  The Bucks got within 67-61 midway through the third quarter and were trying to retake the momentum when Hibbert scored inside and Hill drained a 3-pointer to start a 9-0 run that made it 76-61. The Bucks never got closer than a dozen the rest of the way. QUOTABLE II:  "It's all I could think about last night. Everybody tells me I'm too hard on myself, but I had zero points (Thursday night vs. Washington). I think I was 0-for-5 and I knew it was shots that I normally hit. It just didn't go my way. Sometimes you live by the shot, sometimes you die. That night I died, tonight I lived."    -- Hill, who promised teammates a big game after going scoreless Thursday night against Washington and having eight in the loss to Phoenix on Friday HOT:  Hill was 7-for-9 and led a bench squad that shot 21-for-36 (58.3 percent). NOT:  The Bucks were 19-for-39 after a basket by Ilyasova pulled them within 48-47 with 2:55 left in the half. They went just 10 for their next 34 (29.1 percent) spanning midway into the fourth quarter and were down by 23 before they closed by making 11 of their last 18. GOOD MOVE:  With each team playing its third game in three nights, neither coach played any player more than the 31:32 logged by the Bucks'  Brandon Jennings . NOTABLE:  Bucks sixth man  Mike Dunleavy  was tagged with a flagrant foul for a hit to the face of Indiana's  Tyler Hansbrough  with 10:42 left. Nine seconds after Hansbrough missed both free throws, the two were lined up next to each other as Hill shot two free throws and were each hit with a technical foul as they jawed back-and-forth. They were teammates on the Pacers the previous two seasons, but Dunleavy is a Duke product and Hansbrough is a University of North Carolina product. ... The Bucks reached 30 assists for the sixth time in seven games and the seventh time in 10 games. They lost for the first time when reaching that mark. ... The Bucks scored at least 104 points for the ninth time in 10 games. They fell to 18-5 in games where they score at least 100. ... The 125 points were the Pacers' season high. ... The Bucks now trail New York by 1 1/2 games for the final playoff spot in the East. The two teams meet in New York on Monday night. UP NEXT:  For the Pacers, Monday vs. Miami, Wednesday @ New Jersey, Thursday vs. Washington. For the Bucks, Monday @ New York, Tuesday vs. Atlanta, Friday @ Cleveland.
