 THE FACTS : Fueled by  Carmelo Anthony 's 24 points and 10 rebounds, the New York Knicks won their eighth straight game by beating the Boston Celtics 108-89 at Madison Square Garden on Easter Sunday. 
 Six Knicks (46-26) scored in double-figures, including  Chris Copeland , who had 22 points off the bench, going 3-for-3 from the arc.  Raymond Felton  had 18 points and  J.R. Smith  tallied 15 points and 12 rebounds.  Jeff Green  paced the Celtics (38-35) with 27 points and  Paul Pierce  had 24 points and 15 boards. 
 The Knicks won the season series over the Celtics 3-1, marking the first time they've done so since the 2003-04 season. Heading into Tuesday's showdown at the Miami Heat, New York now leads the second-place Brooklyn Nets by 4 ½ games and the Celtics by 8 ½ in the Atlantic Division. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "Every game we play now is important in terms of us staying at the top of our division and trying to secure that second spot if we can, and I think the guys know that."  
 -- Knicks coach  Mike Woodson 
 
 
 THE STAT : The Knicks went 14-for-27 (52 percent) from the arc, while the Celtics were 7-for-25 (28 percent).  
 
 TURNING POINT : The Knicks outscored the Celtics 37-25 in the second quarter, capping it off with a buzzer-beating 3-pointer from beyond halfcourt by Felton to give them a 65-48 halftime lead. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "I feel like we are playing on the same level as [the Heat]. We got our own little streak going on right now, so we're trying to make it nine in-a-row."  
 -- Raymond Felton on the Knicks game at the Miami Heat on Tuesday during his on-court interview 
 
 WHO'S HOT : After putting up 30-plus points in each of his previous three games, Smith cooled off a little, going 4-for-12 from the field. But he has still put up 119 points in his last four games (29.8). Copeland also put in one of his best efforts of the season for the Knicks. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "The thing about Chris is, when he gets in the game he can score the basketball. We're just working with him on defensive rotations."  
 -- Mike Woodson on Copeland 
 
 WHO'S NOT : The Celtics bench was outscored by the Knicks' bench 50-32.  
 
 NOTABLE : The Knicks were without All-Star center  Tyson Chandler  (stiff neck) for a 10th straight game, but Chandler said he hopes to practice Monday and return Tuesday at Miami. "That's what I'm shooting for barring any setbacks," Chandler said. ... Woodson: "We'll welcome him back if he's ready to go. It's all good." .... Kenyon Martin left the game in the first half with a strained left abdominal muscle, but returned to finish with three points and four rebounds. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA : JB Smoove, Dylan McDermott and Dominique Piek sat courtside. 
 
 QUOTABLE IV : "I like to be on the court and want to be out there for my teammates, so if I can play, I'll play. But I know I also have to do what's best for my teammates and being 100 percent and being able to be active is what's best for my teammates at this point, especially going to the playoffs."  
 -- Tyson Chandler on his imminent return 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Knicks, Tuesday @ Miami, Wednesday @ Atlanta, Friday vs. Milwaukee. For Boston, Monday @ Minnesota, Wednesday vs. Detroit, Friday vs. Cleveland.
