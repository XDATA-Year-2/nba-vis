  Notebook: Raptors 98, Nets 67  Posted Thursday April 26, 2012 11:02PM By Duane Watson, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  The Toronto Raptors (23-43) defeated the New Jersey Nets (22-44) 98-67 at the Air Canada Centre Thursday night. In a battle to avoid the dubious distinction of last place in the Atlantic Division, the Raptors came out on top. The Nets, meanwhile, played like a last place team, shooting only 30 percent from the field, doling out 15 turnovers and down by as many as 38 points. The Raptors closed the first half 54-27 on a 15-0 run and never looked back. After extending their lead to 73-43 after the third quarter they closed the door in the fourth. Both teams had thin rosters due to injury, only seven players got on the floor for the Raptors with only eight players for the Nets. The seven players were all the Raptors needed, led by  Ed Davis'  double-double, scoring a career high 24 points with 12 rebounds and  Gary Forbes  added 23 points.  Ben Uzoh  notched his first career triple-double with 12 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds, while  Solomon Alabi  had his first career double-double with 11 points 19 rebounds and 3 blocks, all career highs. The Nets were led by  Anthony Morrow  and  Armon Johnson  who scored 11 points each,  Jordan Williams  added 10 points and 10 rebounds. The Raptors tied the season-series with the Nets 2-2 as they played their last game ever representing the city of New Jersey as they move to Brooklyn next season. QUOTABLE:  "This game was meaningless, but they came out and laid it on the line and played for 48 minutes."   -- Raptors head coach  Dwane Casey THE STAT:  The score says it all, 98-67. The Nets were never in the game, and when they were close, shot themselves out of it, or turned over the ball, or... With only two starters in the game they didn't have the personnel available to make a serious run. TURNING POINT:  The Raptors started the game on 17-2 run and shot .500 per cent in the first quarter, the Nets could only muster 15 points in the frame. With the Raptors leading wire-to-wire, the Nets never came remotely close to contesting it. QUOTABLE II:  "I can't control that, but I definitely think I seized the moment tonight. I'm just going to keep working and hope for the best come summertime."   -- Raptors guard  Ben Uzoh  on trying to get a contract next season. HOT:  After the first half with the Raptors up 54-27, Raptors guard Anderson went 4-for-7 from the field and 4-for-5 from the 3-point line for 15 points. Davis had 12 points and 6 rebounds on 5-for-8 shooting. Their totals accounted for more than half of their team's scoring and equaled the Nets points for the half. NOT:  Where to start? The Nets shot .301 per cent on 25-for-83 shooting, gave up 15 turnovers and allowed three Raptors scorers to score 20 points or more. They can only be glad their season is over and will get a fresh start in Brooklyn. NOTABLE:  Uzoh's triple-double was the Raptors first since March 23rd since 2001 ( Alvin Williams ). ...
