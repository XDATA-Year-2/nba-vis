  Rockets-Kings notebook   By Jimmy Spencer, for NBA.com Posted Tuesday March 8, 2011 1:08AM THE FACTS:  The Houston Rockets hammered the host Sacramento Kings 123-101 on Monday night to achieve a winning record for the first time this season. The Rockets are surging towards potential playoff positioning, having won seven of their last eight contests. In toppling the .500 mark (33-32), the Rockets pull to within three games back from Memphis for the No. 8 spot in the Western Conference with 17 games remaining in their season. QUOTABLE:  "We finally got an easy game to do that (move over .500). That's not really our goal right now. Our goal is to keep this post all-star break record going. We have our team right now."   --  Rockets guard  Kevin Martin THE STAT:  With the win,  Rick Adelman  entered the Top 10 for all-time coaching victories. Monday night marked win No. 935, tying Adelman with  Dick Motta  for No. 10 on the all-time list.  Red Auerbach  isn't far away at No. 9 with 938 career wins. TURNING POINT:  Holding a 65-58 lead at halftime, the Rockets outscored the Kings by a 30-16 margin in the third quarter to pull away. Of those 30 points, 26 were scored by the combination of Martin (10),  Chase Budinger  (eight) and  Kyle Lowry  (eight). HOT:  Budinger continues to prove himself as a scorer in his role with Houston. Budinger scored a team-high 20 points on 6-for-10 shooting, including 4-for-6 from 3-point range. In his last seven games, the second-year forward has averaged 18.3 points per game. NOT:  The Kings defense. The 123 points allowed by Sacramento was the third most points allowed all season. Sacramento gave up 126 points at Oklahoma City on Feb. 15 and 136 points in an overtime loss at Washington on Jan. 11. The Kings have allowed opponents to top the century mark in 10 of their last 11 games. ROOKIE WATCH:  It was certainly a tale of two different halves for Sacramento's  DeMarcus Cousins . The rookie big man scored 20 points through the game's first half on 10-for-15 shooting. But in the second half, Cousins never scored, going 0-for-5 from the field. It was still an impressive game for the 20-year-old, who finished with his 20 points and tallied 11 rebounds. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Lowry shined statistically, scoring 18 points and adding eight assists and seven rebounds in 29 minutes. NOTABLE:  Adelman claimed 395 of his career wins as head coach of the Kings from 1998-2006. When asked about the Kings' potential relocation to Anaheim, Adelman sympathized for the city of Sacramento. "It's very sad for me because we had some great years here and good memories. I hate to see the fans here and the people in the city of Sacramento lose this team." He added, "I really always believed that they were going to get an arena; I mean I really believed that. Even when I was here this arena was old and I just felt that they were going to get it done through the community. But the economic times hit, and sometimes it's really difficult to get anything done. But it is hard for me to believe there won't be a team here." UP NEXT:  For the Rockets, Tuesday at Phoenix, Saturday vs. San Antonio, Monday vs. Phoenix. For the Kings, Wednesday vs. Orlando, Friday at San Antonio, Saturday at New Orleans.
