 THE FACTS: Nene  scored 20 points and had 11 rebounds,  Martell Webster  added 16 and  John Wall  had 15 points with nine assists to lead the Washington Wizards to their third straight win, 89-74 over the Brooklyn Nets on Friday night. 
 The third consecutive win equaled a season high for the Wizards, who are 10-7 since beginning the season 4-38. Washington held Brooklyn without a field goal for nearly nine minutes in the first half and outscored the Nets 30-11 in the second quarter. 
 Brooklyn, which has lost five of eight, was led by  Deron Williams  with 20 points.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I think everybody knows, I think every team knows what team we would have been like because we're showing things now." 
 
 -- Wall, when asked what the Wizards could have done if they'd been healthy throughout the season. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  No field goals in 8 minutes, 50 seconds. Washington held the Nets without a field goal at the end of the first quarter and the first 8:26 of the second.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  Once Brooklyn was held without the field goal, the Wizards went on a 22-2 run to bury them. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "To come with that kind of effort in the second quarter is, it's inexcusable." 
 
 -- Nets coach  P.J. Carlesimo  on the nightmare quarter 
 
 
 HOT:  Nene was 9-for-13 from the field. In the last two games, he's 15-for-22 from the field. 
 
 NOT:    Andray Blatche  was 2-for-9 from the field and missed five of six from the foul line.  
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Washington running on Brooklyn. Wall was just too fast for the plodding Nets. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Nets fired up shot after shot in the second quarter, missing the first 12 shots of the quarter and finishing 4-for-22. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Nets scored just 74 points, one above their lowest point total of the season.  
 
 IN THE ARENA:  As in his first game as a Net last month, Blatche was booed vehemently by the crowd. "There's no part of me that wants to come back here with the Wizards," Blatche said. "I'm not homesick. I'm happy to be in Brooklyn." 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Nets, Sunday vs. San Antonio, Monday @ Indiana, Wednesday vs. Denver; For the Wizards, Monday @ Milwaukee, Wednesday @ Detroit, Feb. 19 vs. Toronto.
