 THE FACTS: Jrue Holiday  scored 27 points and led five players in double figures as the Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers 101-100 Monday night at the Wells Fargo Center.  Thaddeus Young  scored 19 points,  Spencer Hawes  had 18 points and 13 rebounds,  Dorell Wright  added 16 points and  Damien Wilkins  had 12. The Sixers improved to 26-40 and won their second game in a row. 
 
 LaMarcus Aldridge  was terrific for the Trail Blazers with 32 points and 14 rebounds.  Damian Lillard  scored 27 points, their only other player in double figures. The Trail Blazers fell to 31-35 and had their two-game winning streak snapped. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I think our energy is better. Our focus and attention to detail are much better." 
 -- Hawes 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Sixers shot 50 percent from the field compared to 42 percent for the Trail Blazers. Philadelphia has outshot the opposition in each of the past four games. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Sixers led 101-97 with 13.4 seconds remaining after a pair of free throws by Holiday. But Lillard responded with a 3-pointer and the Trail Blazers got the ball back after a costly Sixers turnover. On Portland's last possession, it went to Aldridge, who missed a short turnaround jumper. 
 
 HOT:  Holiday was 11-for-21, Young was 9-for-15 and Hawes was 9-for-14. Lillard knocked down 10 of his 20 shots. 
 
 NOT: Wesley Matthews  missed nine of his 12 shots for the Trail Blazers while  Nicolas Batum  was 3-for-9. 
 QUOTABLE II: "We always keep fighting and we always put ourselves in position to win, and tonight we did it again. I just didn't make the shot." 
 -- Aldridge on the final possession. 
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Holiday had 27 points, eight rebounds, six assists, one steal and one blocked shot while Hawes had 18 points, 13 rebounds, four assists and two blocked shots. Lillard was solid for the Trail Blazers, going for 27 points, seven rebounds and seven assists. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The crowd of 15,623 was lively from the start. It reached a fever pitch down the stretch as the game went right down to the final possession. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "We've all seen it before. It was a matter of time before it was going to happen." 
 -- Holiday on the recent stretch of strong games from Hawes. 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  On the last possession, the Sixers forced Aldridge to take a difficult shot.  Hawes' defense pushed him maybe a step further from where he wanted to take the shot, and that's all you can ask from a defender. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Trail Blazers could have gotten  J.J. Hickson  more involved in the offense. Hickson finished with four points in 15:51. They could gone to him a lot more, especially with his size against the undermanned Sixers. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  For the Trail Blazers, Lillard scored 27 points while center  Meyers Leonard  had six points and three rebounds. Forward  Joel Freeland  had six points and four rebounds and guard Will Barton was scoreless with two rebounds in 5:24. Sixers forward  Arnett Moultrie  had three points and three rebounds in 9:09. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Sixers announced that injured center  Andrew Bynum  will undergo arthroscopic surgery on both knees Tuesday, thus ending his season. Bynum was acquired in a blockbuster four-team, 12-player deal in the offseason, but has never played for the Sixers because of bilateral knee bone bruises. Bynum's surgery will be performed by  Dr. David Altchek  of the Hospital of Special Surgery in New York. "It's sad," Sixers coach  Doug Collins  said of Bynum. "It's been a tough year for our franchise and a tough year for Andrew." ... The Sixers are 24-7 when outshooting the opponent this season. ... The Sixers had 31 assists, marking the third time registering 30 or more over the past seven games. ... Aldridge scored 16 of his 32 points in the first quarter and it's the sixth time he has scored 30 or more this season. ... The Trail Blazers were 12-for-28 from beyond the arc. ... Over the past four games, Holiday is averaging 22.5 points on 50 percent shooting after averaging 12.0 points on 27 percent shooting the five games prior. 
 
 NEXT:  For the Trail Blazers, Tuesday @ Milwaukee, Thursday @ Chicago, Friday @ Atlanta. For the Sixers, Wednesday @ L.A. Clippers, Thursday @ Denver, Sunday @ Sacramento.
