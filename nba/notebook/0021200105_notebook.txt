 THE FACTS:   It's entirely possible no team ever has played a worse half of basketball and emerged victorious. But that might actually say more about the performance of the team that lost. In the second half, Toronto shot 6-for-33 (18.2 percent), committed seven turnovers, totaled just 28 points -- including just five in a 1-for-15 fourth quarter -- and somehow managed to beat Indiana 74-72 Tuesday in Bankers Life Fieldhouse.  
 The Raptors (2-6) were coming off a 140-133 triple-overtime loss to Utah on Monday and were missing three injured players, while the Pacers had two days off. Yet it was Toronto that played with greater energy, fending off a late rally to snap losing streaks of four overall and seven in Indianapolis. For the Pacers (3-5), the loss was not only maddening, it was ironic -- they set a franchise record for fewest points allowed in a quarter and still could not find a way to win.  DeMar DeRozan  scored 15 for Toronto, while  Jose Calderon  had a triple-double with 13 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds.  George Hill  led the Pacers with 18 points. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Tonight our guys willed their way through the fourth quarter.  They had no legs to score.  But our guys stuck together."

 -- Toronto Coach  Dwane Casey   
 
 
 THE STAT:  After  Linas Kleiza  scored inside with 9:26 remaining to put the Raptors up 71-59, they missed their final nine shots and scored just three points.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  Hill tried to bring the Pacers back, scoring eight points in a 13-3 rally that cut the deficit to 74-72 with 1:02 remaining. After  Amir Johnson  missed a 3-pointer late in the shot clock with 40.8 seconds remaining, the Pacers had four shots to at least tie the game -- one by  David West , two by  Paul George  and one from Hill -- but missed them all.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We were exhausted.  But it's about gutting it out.  We had to rely on something, and it wasn't our offense tonight."  
 
 -- DeRozan 
 
 
 HOT:  Calderon made half of his 10 shots and hit both 3-point attempts.  
 
 NOT:  Pretty much everybody else on both teams. George shot 3-for-14. West and  Roy Hibbert  combined to go 6-for-21, bringing their two-game total to 13-for-52.  Indiana's bench was a combined 4-for-14. Toronto's reserves were 8-for-27.  Andrea Bargnani  was 3-for-13. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Pacers started according to script, jumping on the tired team, coming up with five steals and hitting five of their first six shots in bolting to a 13-4 lead in the first four minutes.   
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Pacers promptly vanished and were outscored 40-17 over the next 18 minutes as the Raptors built a 14-point lead. Indiana shot 7-for-28 in that span to fall into a hole it could not climb from. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:   Jonas Valanciunas  had a solid game for the Raptors with nine points and eight rebounds, going 4-for-8 from the field.  Terrence Ross  also contributed nicely off the bench with seven points on 3-for-5 shooting in 13 minutes. None of Indiana's three rookies played. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Against a defense ranked No. 29 in the NBA entering the game, Indiana shot 10-for-38 (26.3 percent) in the second half and 5-for-24 (20.8) in the fourth quarter and wound up at 32 percent for the game. ... Raptors point guard  Kyle Lowry  (sprained right ankle) and small forward  Landry Fields  (right hand/wrist) traveled to New York to see a specialist to get second opinions. Lowry missed his fourth game in a row, Field his third.  Alan Anderson  (sprained left foot) saw a specialist in Indianapolis today and also did not play. ... DeRozan has averaged 23.8 points in his last four, including a career-high 37 Monday night. ...  D.J. Augustin  has struggled mightily as the backup point guard, for Indiana, shooting 7-for-33 (21.2 percent) overall and 6-for-24 (25 percent) from the 3-point line.
