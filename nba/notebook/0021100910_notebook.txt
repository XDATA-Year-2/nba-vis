  Notebook: Suns 125, Blazers 107 Posted Tuesday April 17, 2012 1:15AM By Mike Tulumello, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  What seemed nearly impossible for the Phoenix Suns now might actually happen. The surging Suns, once a lowly 12-19, now are in playoff position after a 125-107 home win Monday night over the undermanned Portland Trail Blazers. By winning, the Suns (32-29) pulled into the No. 8 and final playoff spot, just ahead of the Houston Rockets (also 32-29). The Suns have the tie-breaker with the Rockets based on a better conference record. "We gotta have a better record than Houston, and we'll be fine," said  Jared Dudley . Well, it's a bit more complicated. The Suns also are only a half-game ahead of the No. 10 Utah Jazz, winners in triple overtime over the Dallas Mavericks Monday. Then too, the Suns now are two games behind the No. 6 Denver Nuggets and 1.5 games behind No. 7 Dallas. The Trail Blazers, by contrast, struggled to compete. In addition to missing star forward  LaMarcus Aldridge , out for the season with a hip injury, the Blazers sat out starting point guard  Raymond Felton  so they could better evaluate  Jonny Flynn  and  Nolan Smith . Also, small forward  Nicolas Batum  sat out while  Luke Babbitt  started and played 39 minutes. Babbitt scored 18. The Suns rested  Grant Hill , who has been rusty after a nine-game absence and whose right knee (which underwent an operation on March 30) is sore. The Suns have five games left, all against winning teams. But only one game, at Utah on Tuesday April 24, is on the road. The Suns got 20 points and 10 boards from  Marcin Gortat . Dudley hit 8-for-10 for 18 points.  Shannon Brown  hit 7-for-10 for 16 points. Steve Nash  had six points and 13 assists while the Suns were able to limit his time to 27 minutes. J.J. Hickson  and  Jamal Crawford  scored 22 each for the Blazers (28-34). QUOTABLE:  "Sebastian is playing as good as any back-up point guard in the league right now."    -- Suns coach  Alvin Gentry  on  Sebastian Telfair , who has emerged as a major surprise for the Suns. THE STAT:  The Suns shot 60 a season-high percent to prevent any drama. TURNING POINT:  Before tipoff, when the Trail Blazers decided to use this game as more of an evaluation for younger players. QUOTABLE II:  "They've been one of the best teams since the All Star break. I think they'll continue to treat every game like a playoff game, and they did that again tonight."    -- The Blazers' Crawford on the rising Suns . HOT: Channing Frye  emerged from his slumber to hit 8-for-11 for 19 points for the Suns. His backup,  Markieff Morris , hit 5-for-9 for 14 points to turn the Suns' frequent weakness -- the power forward spot -- into a strength. NOT:  The Suns'  Michael Redd  had an off night, rare for him the past month, shooting 1-for-7. He did make all six of his free throws. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Telfair has helped turn the Suns' bench from a weakness to a strength. In his last 16 games, he's averaged 8.8 points. On the Suns' recent 4-game road trip, he averaged 13.5 points, 5.0 assists and 1.5 steals. On Monday, he had 12 points, ROOKIE WATCH:  The Blazers' Smith had a nice game. The reserve point guard hit 6-for-14 for 14 points plus five assists and zero turnovers. NOTABLE:  The Suns entered the All Star break six games under .500. The last time a Western Conference team entered the break six games or more below .500 and still made the playoffs: the 1996-97 Suns, who started 0-13 and finished 41-41. The current Suns are 18-9 since the break. They were 14-20 beforehand. UP NEXT:  For the Trail Blazers, Wednesday vs. Jazz, Saturday @ Memphis and Monday @ San Antonio. For the Suns, Wednesday vs. Oklahoma City, Thursday vs. Los Angeles Clippers and Saturday vs. Denver.
