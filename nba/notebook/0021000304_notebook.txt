  Knicks-Timberwolves notebook   By Adam Zagoria, for NBA.com Posted Monday December 6, 2010 11:10PM THE FACTS:   Danilo Gallinari  hit a clutch 3-pointer with 49 seconds left and  Amar'e Stoudemire  dropped 34 points as the Knicks won their fifth straight and 10th in 11 games, 121-114, over the Timberwolves at Madison Square Garden. Stoudemire, the reigning NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week, has scored 30 or more in five straight games. QUOTABLE:  "This was the plan. The plan was to have success." --  Stoudemire THE STAT:  After scoring 21 points in the first half,  Kevin Love  was held to 12 points in the second to finish with 33 and 15 boards. He dropped 31 and 31 in a Nov. 12 win over New York in Minnesota. TURNING POINT:  After trailing by seven at the half, the Knicks forced six straight third-quarter turnovers and outscored the Wolves 31-18 in the period to take a 92-86 lead.  Wilson Chandler  scored nine in the period and  Raymond Felton  tallied seven. QUOTABLE II:  "I don't know if you can play any better than he's been playing the last couple weeks." --  Knicks coach  Mike D'Antoni  on Stoudemire HOT:   Shawne   Williams  went 3 of 4 from beyond the arc and is now 10 of 13 from long-range this season. He put up 13 points and has scored 40 in the Knicks' last three games NOT:   Sebastian Telfair , making an appearance in his hometown, struggled, going 3 for 6 from the field and 4 of 8 from the stripe for 11 points. He has been bothered by plantar fasciitis and Wolves head coach  Kurt Rambis  said he's "struggling with his explosiveness." INSIDE THE ARENA:  Actor  Chazz Palminteri ,  Kenan Thompson  of "Saturday Night Live" and members of the Kansas Jayhawks were in the house. Kansas plays Memphis Tuesday in the Jimmy V Classic at MSG. NOTABLE:  The last time the Knicks won 10 of 11 was between Dec. 22, 2000 -- Jan. 19, 2001. They improved to 4-5 at MSG.
