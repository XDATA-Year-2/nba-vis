 THE FACTS : Sixth man  Ryan Anderson  had 31 points, three shy of his career high, to lead the New Orleans Hornets to a 105-86 victory over the Detroit Pistons at The Palace of Auburn Hills on Monday. Center  Robin Lopez  supplied 23 points and 10 rebounds for New Orleans, which had lost seven of its last 10.  Al-Farouq Aminu  added 12 points and 14 rebounds.  Rodney Stuckey's  19 points led Detroit, which had won its last two games, and  Greg Monroe  had 17 points and 11 rebounds for his seventh straight double-double. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Ryan is such an integral part of our team. When we really need a bucket, he's got such great touch and great instincts. He's a really smart player and makes it a lot easier on us." --  Lopez on Anderson. 
 
 
 THE STAT : 10. The Hornets blocked 10 shots and their ability to seal off the lane disrupted Detroit's offense. The Hornets had a 48-44 edge in paint points and held the Pistons to 35.8 percent shooting, their worst outing since they shot 34.1 percent at Dallas on Dec. 1. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Hornets finished the first half on a 14-5 run to take a 55-41 halftime lead. Lopez had two inside baskets and a block during that stretch and Anderson finished it off with a pair of 3-pointers. The Pistons never got closer than 12 in the second half.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "The way he played in the paint defensively was tremendous. Greg Monroe is a stud and ( Jason) Maxiell  is so physical, and he was helping AD ( Anthony Davis ) out a lot. Then offensively, he was able to dive and finish around the basket. His ability to dive got so many guys open shots." --  Hornets coach  Monty Williams  on Lopez. 
 
 
 HOT:  Lopez has double-doubles in a career-best eight straight games. He shot 64.3 percent from the field in the first seven games of the streak and continued the hot hand by going 9 of 13 from the field on Monday.  
 
 NOT:  Detroit's trio of  Brandon Knight, Charlie Villanueva  and  Will Bynum  had nightmarish outings offensively. Knight was held to seven points and made three turnovers. Villanueva, who made a game-winning 3-pointer against Milwaukee on Saturday, went 2 for 7 from the field and scored just five points in 20 minutes. Bynum, the team's sparkplug backup point guard, missed all eight of his field-goal attempts. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  A matchup between last year's top pick, Davis, and Pistons rookie center  Andre Drummond  fell through last week when Drummond was declared out for 4-6 weeks because of a stress fracture to his fifth lumbar vertebra. Davis had his fourth straight single-digit game with one point on 0-for-7 shooting but made four of the Hornets' 10 blocks. New Orleans guard  Austin Rivers  had seven points while Detroit forward  Kyle Singer  contributed 14 points and five rebounds. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Monroe's double-double streak is the longest by a Piston since  Ben Wallace  recorded seven straight in February 2003. ...Hornets guard  Eric Gordon  sat out on the second game of a back-to-back to protect his oft-injured right knee. ... The Pistons rank fifth in rebounds per game (43.8) after finishing 27th last season at 40.3 but they were outrebounded 49-41 by New Orleans. ... Monroe has 20 20-point, 10-rebound games since the 2011-12 season. Only three Eastern Conference players have more --  LeBron James ,  Dwight Howard ( formerly of the Orlando Magic) and  Josh Smith . ... Corey Maggette , the Pistons' highest-paid player, is healthy but hasn't appeared in a game since Dec. 15. ... Hornets point guard  Greivis Vasquez  added nine points and 13 assists. ... New Orleans has used seven lineups this season, compared to 27 during the lockout-shortened season a year ago.  
 
 NEXT:  For the Hornets, Wednesday vs. Portland, Tuesday Feb. 19 vs. Chicago, Wednesday Feb. 20 @ Cleveland. For the Pistons, Wednesday vs. Washington, Tuesday Feb. 19 vs. Memphis, Wednesday Feb. 20 @ Charlotte.
