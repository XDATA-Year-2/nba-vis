 THE FACT:  The Wizards reached .500 for the fourth time this season. They haven't been over .500 since they were 2-1 on Oct. 31, 2009.  
 
 THE LEAD:   Bradley Beal  nearly had his first career triple-double with 22 points, nine rebounds and eight assists as the Washington Wizards beat the Philadelphia 76ers 107-99 on Monday at the Verizon Center 
 The Wizards took the lead midway through the first quarter and increased it to 21 with six minutes to play. The Sixers, who have lost seven of eight, cut the lead to eight with 2:26 to play but couldn't get any closer. 
 
 Marcin Gortat  had 19 points and 11 rebounds.  Kevin Seraphin  had 16 and  John Wall  added 14. The Sixers were led by  Michael Carter-Williams , who had 31.  Thaddeu s  Young  had 18.  Spencer Hawes  had 11 points and a season-high 16 rebounds. 
 
 QUOTABLE:   "It's not a magical thing [where] I think all of a sudden fairy dust is going to fall on us if we get over .500 [and] we're not going to lose another game." 
 -- Wizards coach  Randy Wittman 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Beal was just 2-for-14 in Saturday's loss to Detroit. Besides the 22 points, he had a season high nine rebounds and tied a career high with eight assists. 
 
 TURNING POINT:   The Sixers cut the Wizards' lead to 70-66 midway through the third quarter. By the end of the quarter, Washington led by 13. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Every time we talk about being a .500 team and getting over .500, we have teams coming in here and just punking our butts." 
 --  Marcin Gortat  on not wanting to talk about the .500 mark 
 
 
 HOT:   Carter-Williams, a possible Rookie of the Year candidate, was 13-for-22 from the field and two points away from equaling his career high. "I struggled the past two games, I think I was trying to force the issue a little bit and this game I was more relaxed and taking what's open.  If the lane was there I was going to score and be strong.  If my teammates were open I was looking to get them the ball," he said. 
 
 NOT:   Philadelphia's  Evan Turner , who coach  Brett Brown  said might get minutes at point guard with  Tony Wroten  out, was just 3-for-10 from the field.  
 
 GOOD MOVE:   Beal wasn't afraid to keep shooting after his horrible performance on Saturday.  
 
 BAD MOVE:   The Wizards' bench frittered away a 21-point lead in the fourth quarter, forcing Wittman to put his starters back in the game. "You're always on audition," Wittman said. 
 
 NOTABLE:   The Wizards' next game, against the Celtics on Wednesday, will be their fourth attempt to get over .500, all at home. They lost to Milwaukee, Dallas and Detroit. "All I'm going to do is think about it in my sleep," Wall said.  
 
 IN THE ARENA:  Adam Silver , who will replace  David Stern  as NBA commissioner, attended the game and sat with Wizards owner  Ted Leonsis . 
 
 UP NEXT:   For the Sixers: Wednesday @ New York, Friday vs. Toronto, Saturday vs. Oklahoma City. For the Wizards: Wednesday vs. Boston, Friday @ Phoenix, Saturday @ Utah.
