 THE FACT:  Portland set an NBA record for best 3-point percentage with at least 15 makes (73.9, 17-for-23). 
 
 THE LEAD:    Wesley Matthews  scored 24 points,  Damian Lillard  chipped in 21 points -- all in the first half -- and  LaMarcus Aldridge  collected 20 points and 15 rebounds in Portland's 130-98 rout of Utah Friday night at the Moda Center. 
    It was the fourth straight victory for the Trail Blazers (17-3), who own the best record in the Western Conference. 
 Leading 67-56 at halftime, Portland outscored Utah 40-13 in the third quarter to put the game on ice. 
 
 Alec Burks  came off the bench to score 16 points for the Jazz, who have the West's worst record at 4-17. 
 
 QUOTABLE:   "Our three-point shooters are good. You don't expect to shoot that well, but our threes are taken in rhythm. They're good shots for the guys taking them. When those guys are taking open threes, there's a good chance they're going in." 
 -- Portland coach  Terry Stotts 
 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Portland cranked up the offense and the defense in the third quarter, holding the Jazz to 6-for-29 shooting to put the game away. 
 
 HOT:  Lillard was 7-for-9 from the field, including 5-for-6 from 3-point range. He didn't take a shot in the second half and didn't play in the fourth quarter. 
 
 NOT:  Going up against one of the top point guards in the league in Lillard, Utah rookie  Trey Burke  was 3-for-9 from the field and had only seven points and one assist in 16 minutes. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It snowballed on us. We fought our way back and got (the deficit) to single digits in the second quarter. Then [in the third quarter the Blazers] turned it up to 20 or 25 like immediately. They shot at a ridiculous clip from 3-point range. It's pretty disappointing."  
 -- Utah's  Gordon Hayward 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Stotts emphasized defense at halftime, which set the Jazz on their heels and produced a 40-point quarter as well. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Utah didn't defend the 3-point line. On this night, it mattered. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:   "A lot of luck. We were feeling it, apparently."  
 -- Wesley Matthews on Portland's record 3-point shooting 
 
 
 NOTABLE:   Portland set a franchise record with its 17 3-pointers (the previous record was 16 set four times). ... The Blazers had their highest-scoring first quarter and first half of the season. The 67 points were the most they have scored in any half. ... The Blazers have won at least 17 of their first 20 games for the third time in franchise history (19 in 1990-91, 17 in 1977-78). ... Lillard has made at least two 3-pointers in an NBA-high 18 games and is the first Blazer to make multiple 3-pointers in 12 straight games since  Damon Stoudamire  in 2005. ... Aldridge got his 10th double-double and became the first player with 450 points, 200 rebounds and 25 steals in his team's first 20 games since Boston's  Kevin Garnett  and Dallas'  Dirk Nowitzki  did it in 2004-05.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Jazz, Sunday vs. Sacramento, Monday vs. Portland, Wednesday @ Sacramento. For the Trail Blazers, Saturday vs. Dallas, Monday @ Utah, Thursday vs. Houston.
