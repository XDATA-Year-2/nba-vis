  Notebook: Jazz 102, Trail Blazers 97 Posted Tuesday April 3, 2012 1:35AM By Kerry Eggers, for NBA.com THE FACTS: Paul Millsap  collected 31 points and 11 rebounds and Utah closed the game on an 8-0 run to pull out a 102-97 victory over Portland on Monday night at the Rose Garden. The Blazers led 97-94 with two minutes to go, but they had a pair of turnovers and went scoreless on their final five possessions. Gordon Hayward  added 20 points for the Jazz (28-26), who moved three games ahead of the Blazers (25-29) in jockeying for the Western Conference playoffs. Wesley Matthews  scored a season-high 33 points and  LaMarcus Aldridge  added 27 for Portland, which led 35-22 after one quarter and by 14 points in the second quarter. QUOTABLE:  "We needed this win bad, and it showed how we played out there. We got down big early, but the will not to lose, the will to make it to that next level to get to the playoffs -- it came out."   --  Millsap. THE STAT:  Portland scored 24 more points than Utah from the 3-point line, making 12 of 22 attempts to 4-of-15 for the Jazz. TURNING POINT:  Portland led 57-48 but Utah scored the final six points of the first half, then made it a 23-3 run by outscoring the Blazers 17-3 to start the third quarter. HOT:  Matthews was 10-of-12 from the field, 5-of-6 from 3-point range and 8-of-10 from the foul line. It was the first time an NBA player has scored 33 points with as few as 12 field goal attempts since Houston's  Yao Ming  accomplished it in December 2008. NOT:  Portland's point guards,  Raymond Felton  and  Jonny Flynn , combined to hit 3-of-15 shots from the field. QUOTABLE II:  "Can't lose any more, it's as simple as that. We can't drop any more games."   --  Matthews. INSIDE THE ARENA:  The crowd announced at 20,050 was the 187th straight sellout at the Rose Garden dating to December 2007. GOOD MOVE:  Utah, the No. 2 rebounding team in the NBA, went inside often to Millsap and  Al Jefferson , winning the points-in-the-paint battle 56-34. BAD MOVE:  Felton turned the ball over when he dribbled the ball off his foot and out of bounds with a minute to go and Portland ahead 97-96. With 26.9 seconds left and the Jazz ahead 98-97, Utah's  Jamaal Tinsley  stole an in-bounds pass from  Nicolas Batum  intended for Felton that led to a Millsap dunk. QUOTABLE III:  "It's hard to swallow a (loss) like that. To be a point guard and make a turnover like that at the end of the game, it's mindboggling for me. i'm upset at myself, more so than anybody else. I could (not) care less about anybody else being upset with me. I'm mad at myself about what happened. I'll try to put it behind me -- try. It's going to be hard to sleep tonight."   --  Felton.  UP NEXT:  For the Blazers, vs. New Jersey Wednesday, @ Dallas Friday, @ Milwaukee Saturday. For the Jazz, vs. Phoenix Wednesday, vs. Golden State Friday, @ San Antonio Sunday.
