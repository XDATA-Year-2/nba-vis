 THE FACT:  The bench scored 56 of Milwaukee's 104 points as the Bucks snapped a nine-game losing streak.  
 
 THE LEAD: Caron Butler  scored 30 points as the Milwaukee Bucks snapped a nine-game losing streak with a 104-101 victory over the Detroit Pistons Wednesday night at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. 
 On a night where the Bucks gave away Butler bobble-head dolls, the veteran forward led a big night for the bench as Milwaukee (8-33) won for the first time in 2014.  Brandon Knight  added 16 points, nine assists and seven rebounds against his former team. 
 
 Brandon Jennings , who went to Detroit in a summertime deal that sent Knight to Milwaukee, led the Pistons (17-25) with 30 points but missed his last five shots, including an 0-for-4 fourth quarter. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It looks like my cousin. But it'll do. We're all related." --  Butler on the bobble-head of him that the Bucks gave away Wednesday night 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Led by Butler's 30, the Bucks bench combined to go 22 of 39 for 56 points. The Bucks' bench also pulled in 20 of the team's 45 rebounds and contributed 14 of the team's 29 assists. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Just 20 seconds after re-entering with 5:16 in the fourth, Bucks forward  John Henson  blocked a shot by  Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  that led to an 18-footer by Butler. That gave the Bucks the lead for good at 98-97. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We weren't helpless. We've got big bodies, too. We gave our best to compete and we put great energy (into the game) and it paid off." --  Bucks center  Miroslav Raduljica , who contributed eight points and eight rebounds off the bench  
 
 
 HOT:  Butler finished 12 for 21, but he was particularly good inside the arc, where he went 10 for 11. 
 
 NOT:  Detroit's  Kyle Singler  went scoreless on 0-for-7 shooting in 19 minutes. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Along with his 30 points, Butler added seven rebounds, five assists, a block and a steal.  
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Bucks coach  Larry Drew  would normally go back to his starting five a few minutes into the fourth quarter but recognized who had the hot hand. Thus, he kept Butler,  Khris Middleton  and Raduljica on the floor for all but a couple of seconds in the fourth quarter.  
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Bucks first-round pick  Giannis Antetokounmpo  moved from small forward to shooting guard and posted four points, five rebounds and three assists in 26 minutes.  
 
 NOTABLE:  After the Bucks got hammered on the boards in a matchup with the Pistons on Dec. 4, Drew went with a big lineup that featured  Ekpe Udoh , Henson and  Ersan Ilyasova  across the front line, with the 6-foot-9 Antetokounmpo moving to guard. The Bucks won the rebound battle, 45-40. ... Center  Larry Sanders  and guard  O.J. Mayo  missed the game for Milwaukee with illnesses. ... The Bucks won for just the fourth time at home (4-15). ... The last time Butler scored 20 or more points coming off the bench was Dec. 16, 2005 against the Los Angeles Lakers while with the Washington Wizards. ... Middleton had four steals for the second straight game. ...  Andre Drummond  (11 points, 12 rebounds) had his ninth double-double in the last 10 games. ... Bucks center  Zaza Pachulia , out since Dec. 4 with a fracture in his right foot, said he hopes to return in the next two weeks before the All-Star break.
