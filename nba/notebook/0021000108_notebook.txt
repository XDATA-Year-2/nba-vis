The Bucks rode a 45-18 skein over the final 16 minutes of the first half to a 54-40 halftime lead and ran the margin to 30 points in the third quarter on the way to handing the Hawks (6-3) their third straight loss. Milwaukee's two best offensive performances have come on back-to-back nights after the Bucks (4-5) beat New York 107-80 at home Tuesday.  Corey Maggette  scored 16 of his team-high 20 points in the first half, and bench-mate  Irsan Ilyasova  scored 17 for the Bucks, who have won three of their past four. QUOTABLE:  "We started the game really sluggish so we have to give our bench a lot of credit tonight. They came back and got our guys back in the game. You come in here and have a [30]-point lead against the Hawks . . . and you're doing something right."    -- Milwaukee coach  Scott Skiles THE STAT:  17 x 2. Over the final 16 minutes of the first half, the Bucks made 17 of 30 shots and out-rebounded Atlanta 17-6, 23-8 when adding loose ball and team rebounds as Milwaukee took advantage of an Atlanta power outage (lack of energy) to turn a 22-9 deficit into a 54-40 halftime lead. TURNING POINT:  It came over the latter part of the first quarter and early in the second, when the Hawks all but stopped playing defense and the Bucks flexed their defense outward. Atlanta used an 16-2 run to take a 20-7 lead in the first quarter on the strength of five jumps shots -- including two 3-pointers by  Mike Bibby .  Joe Johnson  added a jumper to make it 22-9. But The Hawks missed 11 of their next 14 jumpers (those beyond eight feet) over the final 16 minutes of the half, and Atlanta turned the ball over seven times in that span. QUOTABLE II:  "I'm not getting the energy from the bench. I have to find better combinations to use that can sustain the energy."   --  Hawks first-year coach  Larry Drew .  Of the 47 points scored by Atlanta's bench, 32 came in the fourth quarter -- all of which qualified as garbage time given that the Hawks trailed 88-58 very late in the third quarter. The fact that reserve center  Zaza Pachulia  led Atlanta in scoring with 16 underscored this; 14 came in the final period. HOT:  Milwaukee's  Brandon Jennings  made 4 of 5 3-pointers on the way to scoring 19, and has made 20 of 40 shots (and 8 of 14 treys) over his past three games. He has 16 assists and four turnovers in that span. . . . In the past two games, Milwaukee has made 85 of 165 shots (51.5 percent), including 13 of 31 3-pointers with a modest 13 and 12 turnovers while turning the ball over 12 fewer times than the Knicks and Hawks. NOT:  Atlanta "super sub"  Jamal Crawford  has made just 9 of 29 shots in Atlanta's three-game losing streak, including 3 of 13 3-pointers. . . .Al  Horford has grabbed 11 rebounds over the past two games. . . .  Josh Smith  has made 9 of 24 shots in the past two games, including 3 of 9 Wednesday. GOOD MOVE:  Skiles' decision to play Ilyasova more off the bench (nearly 23 minutes Wednesday) paid off. He made 8 of 16 shots and grabbed 10 rebounds Wednesday when his playing time was increased in part because starting guard/forward  Carlos Delfino  missed his second straight game with a strained neck. ROOKIE WATCH:  Atlanta's  Jordan Crawford  got more run than in any game this season, and turned in a career-high 11 points on 5 of 8 shooting with three rebounds and two turnovers. He's got nice burst when he puts the ball on the floor, and elevates quickly. NOTABLE:  Each team was missing a starter, and the Bucks came out much better for it. They're 2-0 with the two best offensive outings of the season without Delfino. The Hawks fell to 1-3 without small forward  Marvin Williams . That win came at lowly Minnesota. "Defensively, it obviously changes up their athleticism with Jason [Collins] being more of a banging center and taking away Al Horford from the center position," Bucks center  Andrew Bogut  said of Hawks without Williams (bone bruise in knee) . "It slows them down a little bit." . . . Bibby scored 9 points to push his career total to 14,008. . . . With two offensive rebounds, Josh Smith passed  Moses Malone  (1,021) and moved into ninth place on the Hawks' all-time list (1,022).  Kevin Willis  is at the top with 2,615. UP NEXT:  For the Bucks, Saturday vs. Warriors, Tuesday vs. Lakers, Nov. 19 @ 76ers. For the Hawks, Friday vs. Jazz, Sunday vs. T-Wolves, Tuesday @ Pacers.
