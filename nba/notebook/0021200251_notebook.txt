 THE FACTS:  Reserve guard  Alexey Shved  scored 17 points and  Josh Howard , making just his third start of the season, added a season-high 16 as the Minnesota Timberwolves drubbed the Philadelphia 76ers 105-88 Tuesday in the Wells Fargo Center. 
 
 Howard, who started at small forward when  Andrei Kirilenko  didn't make the trip because of back spasms, shot 7-for-12 from the field. He also grabbed a season-high 10 rebounds, in recording his first double-double since April 10, 2009, when he played for Dallas. 
 
 All-Star forward  Kevin Love  was limited to a season-low six points, but seven players cracked double figures for the Wolves (8-8). They shot 53.2 percent from the field (41-for-77), and made a season-high 13 3-pointers in 25 attempts, for a season-best 52 percent. They also scored over 100 points for the first time in 13 games, and recorded their most one-sided victory of the year. 
 
 
 J.J. Barea  also had his first double-double of the season, with 11 points and 10 assists. 
 
 
 Evan Turner  led the Sixers (10-8), who have dropped two straight, with 19 points. 
 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "You aren't always going to play like we did tonight. Sometimes you have a bad game. ... I think we're doing a good job of staying aggressive, and it's working out for us."  
 
 -- Minnesota guard  J.J. Barea 
 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Minnesota owned a 57-23 advantage in bench scoring. 
 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Wolves outscored the Sixers 29-19 over the opening nine minutes of the second quarter to take a 63-40 lead. Their advantage was 65-47 at halftime, and never smaller than 14 thereafter. 
 
 
 HOT:  Shved, who entered shooting 38.9 percent from the floor, went 5-for-8, 4-for-7 on 3-pointers. 
 
 
 NOT:  Love, playing his seventh game since returning from a hand injury, shot 2-for-10 for his six points, and saw his double-double streak end. He did grab 10 rebounds. 
 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We've got a 10-8 record, and there's nothing to be sad about. (The loss is) a concern, but it's nothing to go crazy about." 
 
 -- Philadelphia guard  Jason Richardson 
 
 
 
INSIDE THE ARENA : The announced attendance was 13,986. 
 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "They cut it to 14 and everything, but we always made a shot. We kept making shots, and that's the biggest thing." 
 
 -- Minnesota coach  Rick Adelman 
 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The decision by Adelman to play Howard in place of Kirilenko. Howard, averaging 5.9 points before Tuesday, scored 10 in the first quarter alone. 
 
 
BAD MOVE:  The decision by the Sixers to take the floor. They led only once, at 7-6, and were down 34-21 after a quarter. 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Richardson (14),  Jrue Holiday  (13) and  Thaddeus Young  (13) also reached double figures for the Sixers. ... Holiday also had nine assists, and Richardson paced his team with seven rebounds. ... The other Wolves to crack double figures were  Dante Cunningham  (13),  Luke Ridnour  (10),  Malcolm Lee  (10) and  Derrick Williams  (10). ... The Wolves' 65 first-half points were the most they have scored in any half this year, and the most the Sixers have allowed in a half. 
 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Timberwolves, Wednesday @ Boston, Friday vs. Cleveland, Dec. 12 vs. Denver. For the Sixers, Friday vs. Boston, Saturday @ Boston, Dec. 10 vs. Detroit.
