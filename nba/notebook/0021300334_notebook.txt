 THE FACT:   Kevin Garnett  grabbed his 14,000th rebound during the third quarter, becoming the 10th player in league history to reach that mark. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Center  Andre Drummond  and power forward  Greg Monroe  combined for 44 points and 24 rebounds as the Detroit Pistons (11-13) ended a three-game losing streak with a 103-99 victory over the Brooklyn Nets (8-15) on Friday night at The Palace of Auburn Hills. Guard  Rodney Stuckey  added 17 points and forward  Kyle Single r chipped in 16 off the bench for Detroit, which led by 21 early in the fourth and barely survived the Nets' late rally. Point guard  Deron Williams  led Brooklyn with 22 points and nine assists while forward  Andray Blatche  had 20 points and 12 rebounds. The Nets, who saw their three-game winning streak snapped, also received 17 points from reserve forward  Mirza Teletovic . 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It wasn't isolations that got us that lead. We were moving the ball and moving around. You shouldn't change that. Just play the same way. Sometimes it calls for that, trying to beat the clock up, but not for a whole seven or eight minutes." --  Pistons guard  Chauncey Billups  on the Pistons' offensive struggles during the fourth quarter  
 
 
 THE STAT:  Six. Drummond had made just 30 of his 80 free throw attempts coming into the game but he knocked down six straight during the second quarter, when he scored 16 of his points. Drummond sometimes gets intentionally fouled when the Pistons are ahead but that strategy will have diminishing results if he has more nights like Friday.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  Drummond and Stuckey combined for 30 of Detroit's 38 second-quarter points as it took a 61-44 halftime lead.  The Pistons shot 12-for-21 from the field and 14-for-19 from the free throw line during the quarter while forcing six turnovers.  
 
 HOT : Nets coach  Jason Kidd  started Teletovic in the second half in an attempt to shake things up and that move paid large dividends. Teletovic erupted with five second-half 3-pointers and finished one point shy of his career high.  
 
 NOT:  Pistons point guard  Brandon Jennings  got caught up in his one-on-one matchup with Deron Williams and paled in comparison. Jennings made just 3-for-14 field-goal tries and had just four of the team's 23 assists.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I work hard at it every day and the results are going to show up sooner than later. Tonight was an example of the hard work I put into it." --  Drummond, who raised his season free throw shooting percentage to 40.9 by making six of eight 
 
 
 FANTASY FOCUS : Stuckey has been dynamite in his role as a sixth man most of the season, reaching 15 points in 15 of 21 games. He'll continue to rack up big offensive numbers since coach  Mo Cheeks  likes to put the ball in Stuckey's hands when he's in the game.  
 
 NOTABLE:  Brooklyn played without center  Brook Lopez , who sprained his left ankle during its 102-93 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday. Lopez also missed the first meeting between the clubs, a 109-97 Detroit win at Brooklyn's Barclay Center on Nov. 24. Brooklyn is 1-7 without Lopez ... Pistons forward  Josh Smith , who scored 10 points, was playing in his 700th career game. ... Nets forward  Paul Pierce  has come off the bench for three consecutive games, doubling his career total in 1,120 games. He had 12 points.... The Nets had won their last two games at The Palace after dropping 15 of 17. ... Detroit's two steals was a season low but Drummond recorded his 100th career steal. ... Blatche's 20-12 game was his second double-double this season, and his first 20-10 game of the season...Williams is averaging 20.7 ppg in three games since returning...the Pistons are 9-4 when holding opponents under 100 points. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Nets, Monday vs. Philadelphia, Wednesday vs. Washington, Friday @ Philadelphia. For the Pistons, Sunday vs. Portland, Monday @ Indiana, Wednesday @ Boston.
