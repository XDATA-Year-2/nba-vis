  Notebook: Thunder 92, Bulls 78   By Randy Renner, for NBA.com Posted Sunday April 1, 2012 4:29PM THE FACTS:  A dramatic game between the top teams in the Western and Eastern Conferences wasn't to be in Oklahoma City as the Thunder never trailed, led by as many as 30 points and won their sixth straight game in blowing out Chicago 92-78.  OKC's  Russell Westbrook  (27 points) and  Kevin Durant  (26) easily led all scorers and didn't play in the fourth quarter. Chicago had to play without point guard  Derrick Rose  for the 10th straight game. He's battling a groin injury and  Rip Hamilton  missed his 15th consecutive contest with a bruised shoulder. The Thunder defense was stifling, holding the Bulls to just 30.6 percent shooting almost halfway through the fourth quarter. Chicago's  Kyle Korver  (14 points) was the only Bulls starter in double figures. Reserve guard  John Lucas III  led the Bulls with 19 points, but 14 of them came in the fourth quarter after the game was decided. QUOTABLE:  "We played our best defense of the year. We challenged every pass, challenged every look and every shot. We came out with good energy and toughness and I thought it was important that we do that in this game."   --Thunder coach  Scott Brooks THE STAT:  In the third quarter Oklahoma City held Chicago to just 23.8 percent shooting (5-for-21). The Thunder shot 54.5 percent (12-for-22). For the game the Thunder held the Bulls starters to just 39 points on 32.7 percent shooting. TURNING POINT:  The Thunder never trailed, but Oklahoma City really ran away from Chicago in the third quarter by holding the Bulls to just 10 points in the first nine and a half minutes of the quarter and only 12 for the entire frame. Meanwhile, OKC scored 31, turning a 10-point halftime advantage into a 29-point cushion going into the fourth quarter. QUOTABLE II:  "It wasn't just the third quarter, it was the second and the first too. We didn't come ready to play and that's on me. They were much more aggressive than we were and I didn't think our defense was very good either. When you play like you're basically beating yourself."   -- Bulls coach  Tom Thibodeau HOT:  The Thunder started 4-for-6 (66.7 percent) ... Durant and Westbrook were each 2-for-2 ... Durant finished the first half 6-for-9 (14 points), Westbrook was 7-for-12 (18 points) at the break ... For the game, Durant was 11-for-16 (2-for-2 on 3-pointers) and Westbrook was 10-for-18 ... In the fourth quarter, Lucas scored 14 points on 5-for-10 shooting. NOT:  The Bulls started 1-for-6 (16.7 percent) and finished the first quarter 9-for-23 (39.1 percent) ... Chicago shot just 35.6 percent (16-for-45) in the first half ...  Joakim Noah  was 0-for-5 and Lucas was 2-for-8 in the first 24 minutes ... Noah finished 1-for-8,  Luol Deng  was 4-for-13. INSIDE THE ARENA:  11-year old  Addison Baker  from Norman, Okla., got the crowd fired up early with a rousing rendition of the National Anthem ... Legendary former University of Oklahoma and Dallas Cowboys football coach  Barry Switzer  was in the crowd. GOOD MOVE:  Thibodeau opted to start Korver ahead of  Ronnie Brewer  and Korver responded by hitting three of his first five shots, two of them 3-pointers. GOOD MOVE, TOO:  Despite the Bulls' reputation as the best defensive team in the NBA, it was the Thunder who brought the "D" in the first half, limiting Chicago to 35.6 percent shooting. The Thunder bothered the Bulls with active hands throughout the first half forcing difficult shots, a trend that continued all game. NOTABLE:  With the win, the Thunder has the tie-breaker over the Bulls should the two teams finish with the same record in the regular season. That could come into play if both teams make it to The Finals ... Chicago's 78 points is the second fewest for the Bulls this season ... OKC has won six straight games, the third such streak of the season ... The Thunder has now held 14 opponents to less than 40 percent shooting this season ... Oklahoma City is now 16-3 in national TV games and 6-0 on Sundays. UP NEXT:  For the Bulls, Monday vs. Houston, Thursday vs. Boston, Sunday @ New York. For the Thunder, Monday vs. Memphis, Wednesday @ Miami, Friday @ Indiana.
