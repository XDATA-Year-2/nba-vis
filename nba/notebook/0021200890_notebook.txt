 THE FACTS: Monta Ellis  scored 34 points,  Brandon Jennings  added 20 points and 17 assists and  J.J. Redick  scored eight of his 17 points in overtime to help the Milwaukee Bucks to a 109-108 victory over the Utah Jazz Monday night at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. 
 Jennings' 3-point shot with 8.4 seconds in regulation sent the game to overtime tied at 99, and Redick scored Milwaukee's first eight points of the extra period before Ellis drilled a huge 18-footer with 14.7 seconds left that made it 109-106. 
 
 Larry Sanders  chipped in eight points, 16 rebounds and six blocked shots as Milwaukee (30-28) won its fourth straight. 
 
 Derrick Favors  led the Jazz (32-28) with 23 points and 15 rebounds, and  Paul Millsap  added 22 points and 14 rebounds. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "You look at the game Monta had and the game Brandon had ... I know OK City puts up some combo numbers, as does Miami and so on, but that was a hell of a backcourt duo putting on quite a show. There was a time I was like, 'This must be a great game to watch if you're sitting in the stands.'" --  Bucks coach  Jim Boylan  on his backcourt duo's performance. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Milwaukee's tandem of Jennings and Ellis outscored Utah's starting backcourt of  Randy Foye  and  Earl Watson , 54-0. Foye and Watson combined to go 0-for-10, Jennings and Ellis were 23-of-35. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Redick was just 1-for-5 on 3-pointers in regulation but his second 3-pointer of the overtime gave the Bucks a 107-105 lead with 47 seconds left, and the Jazz never got back to even. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I was just taking what was there. I don't feel like I was struggling at all. I had some good looks and the ball was in-and-out a lot of times. I never feel like I'm struggling. I always feel like the next one is going in." --  Redick on going 3 - for-5 in overtime after being 4-for-9 in regulation. 
 
 
 HOT:  Ellis went 15-for-21 (71.4 percent) and is 24-for-39 (61.5 percent) in his last two games. Before these two games he was shooting 40.1 percent (391-for-975). 
 
 NOT:  Foye (0-for-6), Watson (0-for-4) and bench player  Gordon Hayward  (3-for-16) combined to go 3-for-26. Only backup point  Alec Burks  (7-for-10, 19 points) had any backcourt success for the Jazz. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Combined with his 11 points and 19 assists Saturday, Jennings is averaging 15.5 points and 18 assists in his last two games. Since the acquisition of Redick he's embraced the role of distributor.  
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Although the Jazz big men were killing his team, Boylan went with the three-guard combo of Jennings, Ellis and Redick for the entire overtime. Redick scored eight and Ellis had the Bucks' other two points in the extra five minutes. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Favors had 17 points and 14 rebounds in 18 first-half minutes, but Jazz coach  Tyrone Corbin  used him for just 12 of a possible 29 minutes in the second half.  
 
 NOTABLE:  Jazz center  Al Jefferson  missed his second straight game with a sprained left ankle, and guard  Jamaal Tinsley  was not with the team to attend a family funeral. ... The victory marked the first time since Feb. 15 and 17, 1991 that the Bucks won consecutive overtime games. ... The Bucks now lead Philadelphia by seven games for the final playoff spot. Looking up, they're now just a game behind seventh-place Boston, 2 ½ behind sixth-place Atlanta and 3 behind Chicago and Brooklyn, which are tied for fourth. ... The Bucks have played eight straight games that were decided in the last minute, with six of them decided by five or fewer points in regulation and two in overtime. ... Jennings became the first Buck with back-to-back games of 15 assists or more since  Sam Cassell  had 15 and 18 Dec. 4 and 5, 1999. ... Sanders has blocked at least one shot in 40 straight games. ... Small forward  Marvin Williams  was scoreless on 0-for-5 shooting, giving the Jazz three starters that were shut out. ... Utah outrebounded the Bucks, 59-42, including 23-12 on the offensive glass. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Jazz, Wednesday @ Cleveland, Friday @ Chicago, Saturday @ New York. For the Bucks, Wednesday @ Los Angeles Clippers, Saturday @ Golden State, Sunday @ Sacramento.
