 THE FACT:  With their fourth straight win, the Grizzlies got back to .500 for the first time since Dec. 9.  
 
 THE LEAD:   James Johnson  scored eight points during a 12-0 run to open the fourth quarter, as the Memphis Grizzlies gutted out an 82-77 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks Wednesday night at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. Johnson, signed out of the Developmental League a month ago, finished with 15 points, six rebounds, six blocked shots, five assists and two steals as the Grizzlies (19-19) won their fourth straight and ninth in their last 13 games.  Mike Conley  added 15 points, seven rebounds and five assists. 
 
 Brandon Knight  scored 27 to lead Milwaukee (7-31), which lost its seventh straight game. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I've been able to get to them, luckily, using my athleticism and timing people's jump shot at the top." 
 -- Johnson, who had four of his six blocks in the fourth quarter. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Bucks shot just 37.8 percent (31 for 82) and were done in by streaks of 15 straight misses in the first quarter and 12 straight misses spanning the last minute of the third quarter and the first 5:30 of the fourth quarter. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Bucks trailed by as many as 14 in the second quarter, but rallied to take a 60-58 lead entering the fourth quarter. To that point, the Grizzlies had just five points off 13 Milwaukee turnovers. But Johnson scored six points off three Milwaukee miscues in the opening 4 and 1/2 minutes of the fourth quarter during the decisive 12-0 run.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "That is an effort stat. It really is. At halftime we had forced 10 turnovers and created three points off them. When the other team turns it over, it's like jail break, right. 'Let's go! Let's go!'" 
 -- Memphis coach  Dave Joerger  on the Grizzlies turning turnovers into points in the fourth quarter. 
 
 
 
 HOT:  Grizzlies reserve forward  Ed Davis  made 7-of-8 shots for his 14 points. 
 
 NOT:  After making 11-of-16 shots for a season-high 29 points on Monday, Bucks forward  Ersan Ilyasova  was just 2-for-11. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The attendance was announced as 11,379, but there were considerably fewer actually on hand.  
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Joerger would normally come back with  Marc Gasol  in the fourth quarter, but with Gasol struggling in just his second game back from a knee injury, Joerger stuck with Johnson, who had a monster quarter. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Bucks had a chance to tie in the closing seconds, but the only player they could get open was center  Larry Sanders , whose 3-pointer with 5 seconds left bounced off the back of the rim. Sanders has not made a 3-pointer in five career attempts. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Bucks first-round pick  Giannis Antetokounmpo  was plagued by early foul trouble and finished with six points, one rebound and one assist.  
 
 NOTABLE:  Guard  O.J. Mayo , who was the Bucks' leading scorer over the first eight weeks of the season, played just 6 1/2 minutes -- none in the second half. ... The Bucks had three players with double-figures in rebounds -- Sanders (12), Ilyasova (13) and  John Henson  (13). ... Bench players scored 18 of the Grizzlies' 24 fourth-quarter points. ... Bucks forward  Khris Middleton  sprained his ankle in practice on Tuesday and did not start. He did come in off the bench but made just 1 of 6 shots and is 6 for 35 over his last four games. ... Memphis has won the last six games in the series with the Bucks, holding Milwaukee under 100 in each of the six games. ... Memphis went on a 24-3 run after falling behind, 8-1. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Grizzlies, Friday vs. Sacramento, Monday vs. New Orleans, Thursday @ Houston. For the Bucks, Saturday @ Houston, Sunday @ San Antonio, Wednesday vs. Detroit.
