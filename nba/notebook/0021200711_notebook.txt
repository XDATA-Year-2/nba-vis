 THE FACTS :  The Miami Heat defeated the Charlotte Bobcats 99-94 Monday at AmericanAirlines Arena. Forward  LeBron James  led the way with 31 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. Center  Chris Bosh  had his second consecutive strong game, scoring 23 points on 11-for-18 shooting. Despite a poor shooting night, guard  Dwyane Wade  finished with 20 points and 12 rebounds.  
 The Heat (31-14) trailed 74-73 with 7:45 remaining before going on an 8-0 run to take control.  Ramon Sessions  led the Bobcats (11-36) with 18 points.  
 
 QUOTABLE : "We'll take it. Charlotte played tough and those guards, for a while it looked like we were playing in a [6-foot-4]-and-under league. They were able to really attack and really just spread the court but I thought our guys came back with a decent amount of energy."  
   --Heat coach  Erik Spoelstra  
 
 
 THE STAT :  The Heat held the Bobcats to just 42 percent shooting.  
 
 TURNING POINT : After playing nearly to a standstill, the Heat broke things open with the 8-0 run in the fourth quarter.  
 
 HOT : James shot 13-for-14 from the field, with most of his points coming on the interior. It was the most efficient shooting game of his career.   
 
 NOT : Wade was just 7-for-19 from the field, but was able to make up for it with his defense and rebounding. His six offensive rebounds were especially beneficial to the Heat.  
 
 GOOD MOVE : When in doubt, go to James. That has been the Heat's motto for most of the season. They turned to the reigning MVP for a second straight game to avoid falling to an inferior opponent.  
 
 BAD MOVE : The Bobcats at times settled for the 3-point shot. They made eight, but 25 attempts were just too many when guards  Kemba Walker  and Sessions were able to create their own shot against the Heat.  
 
 NOTABLE : It was the fifth time Wade, James and Bosh scored at least 20 points. ... Wade's 12 rebounds were a season-high. ... Bobcats' center  Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  did not play because of a concussion.  
 
 UP NEXT : For the Heat, Wednesday vs. Rockets, Friday vs. Clippers, Sunday vs. Lakers. For the Bobcats, Wednesday @ Cavs, Friday vs. Lakers, Saturday @ Sixers.
