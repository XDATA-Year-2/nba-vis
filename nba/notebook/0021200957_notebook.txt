 THE FACTS :   John Wall   tallied 23 points and 10 assists as the Washington Wizards let a 20-point, second half  lead slip away but hung tough for a 106-93 win over the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday night. 
 After leading 66-46 early in the third quarter, the Wizards (21-42) found themselves on the wrong end of a 32-9 run and entered the fourth period trailing 78-75. Even with momentum now on the Bucks' side, Washington scored the first seven points of the fourth quarter in what turned into an 18-6 spurt. 
 Six Wizards scored in double figures, including  Martell Webster  with 20 and  Trevor Ariza  with 14.  Nene  had 13 points and 13 rebounds, while  Trevor Booker  set season-highs with 13 points and 12 rebounds.  
 Webster scored 17 and went 3-for-4 on 3-pointers in the first half as Washington used a 14-0 second quarter run to lead 60-44 at halftime. 
 
 Monta Ellis  paced the Bucks (32-31) with 26 points.  Ersan Ilyasova  had 12 of his 21 points during the Milwaukee's third quarter rally and grabbed 12 rebounds. The Bucks missed 11 of his 17 shots in the fourth quarter en route to their second straight loss. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "Like coach [Randy Wittman] said, 'We basically won the game twice.'" 
 -- Wizards guard  Garrett Temple  describing the back-and-forth second half. 
 
 THE STAT : The Wizards scored at least 30 points in all but the second quarter, including 31 in the fourth as they outscored the Bucks by 16. Washington shot 50 percent from the field and made half of its 16 3-point tries. 
 
 QUOTABLE II :  "Just a terrible game. We made our run, but we shouldn't have been in that position anyway." 
 -- Monta Ellis on the Bucks' disappointing finish  
 
 HOT : Wall picked up his second double-double in as many games after finishing with 27 points,14 assists in Monday's road loss against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Over the last five games -- all played without his back-court partner  Bradley Beal  -- Wall is averaging 19.6 points and eight assists. 
 
 NOT : After averaging 17 points over his last two games, including one as a starter, Bucks forward  Mike Dunleavy  played a 26 scoreless minutes, missing all six of his field goal attempts. 
 
 GOOD MOVE : With Beal and  A.J. Price  (sore right groin) out, Wall and Temple were the only true guards on Washington's roster. Rather than get cute and play others for long stretches in the backcourt, Wizards coach  Randy Wittman  stuck with his two starters for over 41 minutes each. Temple made 6 of his 7 shots and scored 13 points. Combined, the pair had 14 assists with only four turnover while making 16 of their 26 field goal attempts. 
 
 QUOTABLE III :  "Just being more aggressive and taking better shots than what I was taking," Wall said of the recent uptick in production. "Just give credit to me working harder with [assistant coach]  Sam [Cassell]  on my jump shot, those type of things." 
 -- John Wall on his recent rise in production 
 
 NOTABLE :  Wall and Wittman were seen arguing late in the third quarter. Both later blew off any issue, describing the matter as the two trying to figure out how to stop Ilyasova. "Oh, that's coaching. C'mon," Wittman said emphatically. "I love that." ...  Larry Sanders  finished 17 points and 11 rebounds before being ejected late in the fourth quarter after picking up two technical fouls. ...  J.J. Redick  scored 16 for the Bucks. ... Ariza was a game-time decision with a sore left knee, but ended up playing 30 minutes. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Bucks, Thursday vs. Heat, Saturday vs. Magic, Monday at Trail Blazers. For the Wizards, Friday vs. Hornets, Saturday vs. Suns, Monday @ Bobcats.
