  Notebook: Clippers 74, Blazers 71 Posted Friday February 17, 2012 2:32AM By Kerry Eggers, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  Los Angeles outscored Portland 22-11 in the fourth quarter to pull out a grinding, come-from-behind 74-71 victory Thursday night at the Rose Garden. It was the fourth straight home loss for the Blazers (16-15), who were playing their third game in three nights. Blake Griffin  collected 21 points and 14 rebounds for the Clippers (19-9), who were playing the second of back-to-back games. Chris Paul -- 0-for-7 and scoreless through three quarters -- was 5-for-8 and scored all 13 of his points in the final stanza. Portland held an 18-point advantage early in the third period but scored on 28 second-half points.  Nicolas Batum  and  Jamal Crawford  each scored 19 points for the Blazers.  Wesley Matthews  -- whose desperation, turnaround 3-point attempt at the buzzer went awry -- added 16. QUOTABLE:  "I couldn't make a shot. [The Blazers] were doing a really good job of defending. ... I'm still mad I didn't perform, but in the fourth quarter I was telling the guys that's where it matters."    -- Chris Paul, who scored all 13 of his points in the final 9:35 of the game. THE STAT:  The Clippers won despite shooting .385 from the field, including 2-for-17 from 3-point range. The winners missed their first 13 attempts from beyond the arc. Portland shot .380 from the field after shooting .577 through a quarter in a half. Over the last 2 1/2 periods, the Blazers made 12-for-44 from the field (.273). TURNING POINT:  Portland led 66-64 inside the final five minutes. At that point, the Clippers were 0-for-13 on 3-point attempts. Then  Mo Williams  and Paul each drilled one from beyond the arc for a 70-67 lead. The Blazers never recovered. QUOTABLE II:  "We had a pretty good win last night. We were in a good mood today. We did a good job the first half. Then we started to relax a little bit and killed ourselves."    -- Portland's Nicolas Batum, who scored 15 of his 19 points in the first quarter. HOT:  Batum's first quarter was suitable for framing -- 15 points on 6-for-7 shooting, including 2-for-2 from 3-point range. He hit his first shot of the second quarter, a 19-footer to give the Blazers a 39-24 lead. He was 1 for 8 the rest of the way. NOT:   Raymond Felton  continued his shooting woes, going 0-for-7 from the field. Portland's point guard was scoreless with two assists and five turnovers in 24 minutes. QUOTABLE III:  "Coach [ Vinny ]  Del Negro  kept telling us, 'In the fourth quarter -- that's when it's going to happen.' And that's when we made our run."    -- Clippers forward Blake Griffin. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Actor  Timothy Hutton , in Portland filming his TV series "Leverage," was courtside. GOOD MOVE:  The Clippers began switching everything on the Blazers' pick-and-rolls sets late in the first half. From that point, Portland's offense went stagnant. BAD MOVE:  Batum, the Blazers' best offensive threat through three quarters, took only one shot the final 12 minutes. NOTABLE:  It's the first time Portland has lost four straight home games since Dec. 29, 2006 through Jan. 7, 2007. UP NEXT:  For the Blazers, Saturday vs. Atlanta, Monday at L.A. Lakers, Tuesday vs. San Antonio. For the Clippers, Saturday vs. San Antonio, Monday at Golden State, Wednesday vs. Denver.
