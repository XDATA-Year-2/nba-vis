 THE FACTS: Dwyane Wade  and  LeBron James  carried the Miami Heat to their 10th consecutive victory following a 24-point rout of the Philadelphia 76ers, 114-90, before a sellout crowd of 20,665 Saturday night at the Wells Fargo Center. Wade had a sensational shooting night, going 14-for-18 for a game-high 33 points while James earned his 35th career triple-double with the Heat after compiling 16 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds.  Mario Chalmers  scored 14 points and  Chris Bosh  had 13 for the Heat, who improved to 39-14, the best record in the Eastern Conference.  Ray Allen  and  Norris Cole  also added 12 points each off the bench. 
 The Sixers (22-31) continue to spiral in the wrong direction following their fourth consecutive loss.  Jrue Holiday  scored 21 points and  Nick Young  added 19 points.  Dorell Wright  scored 17 points and  Evan Turner  had 16 for the Sixers, who have dropped two in a row since the All-Star break to fall a season-worst nine games under .500. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We had our chances and we took advantage of them. When we're moving the ball like that, we're a very, very good team." --  Bosh. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Sixers were not credited with any fast break points. The Sixers are averaging 12.3 fast break points per game this season. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Heat built a 56-47 lead at halftime and then outscored the Sixers 31-24 in the third. Miami won every quarter but that third quarter was the difference. 
 
 HOT:  Wade knocked down 14 of his 18 shots while James was 7-for-12. The Heat shot 58.4 percent as a team -- 45-for-77. 
 
 NOT: Spencer Hawes  missed four of his five shots while  Lavoy Allen  was 2-for-7. It was a fairly empty night for the Sixers' big men. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "That team is big-time good. They're a great, great team. I don't see any weaknesses." --  Sixers coach  Doug Collins , on the Heat. 
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  James had his third triple-double of the season and the 35th of his career with 16 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  There was an electric crowd of 20,665 for this anticipated matchup against the Heat. The fans were loud and enthusiastic from the opening tip to the final buzzer, though those cheers turned to boos following a 24-point loss by the home team. A number of Philadelphia Flyers' players took in the action from a suite. The Flyers defeated the Winnipeg Jets, 5-3, earlier Saturday at the Wells Fargo Center.  
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "I don't need to score for us to win. Every time I drove, I had two or three guys coming at me and I was looking to move the ball." --  LeBron . 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Heat monitored James' minutes and allowed him to get some much-needed rest. With 29 regular season games remaining, the Heat are smart enough to realize they'll need James to be as fresh as possible. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Sixers could have played a more physical style against Wade and James. They're not a physical team on a consistent basis, but on this night, it might have been wise to put some extra pressure on Miami's dynamic duo. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Heat forward  Jarvis Varnado  was scoreless in 2:57. For the Sixers, forward  Arnett Moultrie  had three rebounds in 6:50. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Heat guard  Mike Miller  didn't make the trip to Philadelphia because of sinus and ear infections. ... Wade has scored 30 or more points in three of the past eight games. ... Turner had the Sixers' lone steal. It was a floor record for least number of steals by a team, dating to 1996 when the arena opened. ... The Sixers have scored below 93 points in each of the past nine games. ... The Heat shot a season-high 58.4 percent from the field. They are 24-2 when shooting 50 percent or better. ... The Sixers are 0-12 when allowing the opponent to shoot 50 percent or better. ... Holiday has scored 20 or more points 20 times this season. ... Eight of Miami's 10 straight wins have been by double figures. ... Injured Sixers center  Andrew Bynum  practiced with the team last Friday for the first time this season. Bynum hasn't made his debut with the Sixers since being acquired in the offseason. "He looked like a guy who hadn't played in nine months," Collins said of Bynum's performance in practice. 
 
 UP   NEXT:  For the Heat, Sunday vs. Cleveland, Tuesday vs. Sacramento, Friday vs. Memphis. For the Sixers, Sunday @ New York, Tuesday vs. Orlando, Thursday @ Chicago.
