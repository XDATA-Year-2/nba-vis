 THE FACT : The Knicks lost their fifth straight home game and dropped to 1-5 at Madison Square Garden.  
 
 THE LEAD:   Jeff Teague  scored 16 points and  Kyle Korver  had 15 as eight Atlanta Hawks reached double-figures in a 110-90 blowout win over the Knicks at Madison Square Garden. 
 
 Paul Millsap  added 14 points and 13 rebounds and  Al Horford  and  Shelvin Mack  tallied 12 points apiece. 
 
 Carmelo Anthony  led the Knicks with 23 points on 8-for-21 shooting and  Andrea Bargnani  had 16.  
 New York's last home win came Oct. 30, opening night. The last time the Knicks lost five straight home games was in February 2010 under  Mike D'Antoni . 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "They were the only team to hold us to 100 points. We just made it interesting, keep our pace going, play fast. When we're playing like that we're a tough team." 
 -- Teague 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Knicks entered the night -11.4 in free-throw differential, 30th among 30 NBA teams. 
 
 THE STAT II:  The Hawks' bench outscored the Knicks' reserves, 43-26. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Hawks outscored the Knicks 30-21 in the second period to take a 54-47 halftime lead. Atlanta then outscored New York, 56-43, as New York never made a run after the intermission. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I just though they played harder than we played. You're not going to beat anybody playing soft the way we did." 
  -- Knicks coach  Mike Woodson 
 
 
 WHO'S HOT:  Teague has scored 16, 33 and 25 points in his last three games, for a total of 74 points. The 33 was a career-high Friday night against Philadelphia. 
 
 WHO'S NOT:  J.R. Smith  shot 3-for-18 and 1-for-9 from the arc for seven points. Some Knicks fans chanted "Put in Chris" in reference to J.R.'s younger, who has yet to play this season. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  'Excuse my language, but I'm playing like [crap]." 
 -- Smith 
 
 
 NOTABLE: Amar'e Stoudemire , who has been on a 10-minute-restriction, played 14 minutes and produced five points on 2-for-5 shooting with two rebounds. He said before the game that he wanted to play 20-25 minutes per game for two games in a row and then rest for a game or two, á la  Tim Duncan . "I think now Woody's going to try to ramp up the minutes and we'll see if it gets better," Stoudemire said. Said Woodson pregame: "I just gotta get him comfortable in the short minutes that he's played. If it's 10 minutes, 15 minutes, we gotta get something. I just gotta help him. I gotta help him help us." 
 
 NOTABLE II:  Smith said he won't appeal the NBA's $25,000 fine for his inappropriate Twitter comments directed at Detroit's  Brandon Jennings , but that he will try to police himself better on Twitter. "No I'm not going to do that," he said when asked if he might quit Twitter. "I just have to be better at policing myself." 
 
 QUOTABLE IV:  "Right now we're not playing well as a basketball team and that's on me as a coach." 
 -- Woodson 
 
 
 QUOTABLE V:  "At the rate this is going, we're going to be in too deep of a hole to dig out." 
 -- Anthony
