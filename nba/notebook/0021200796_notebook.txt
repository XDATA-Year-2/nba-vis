 THE FACTS : The Sacramento Kings gave the NBA's best team a run for their money before falling 108-102 to the mighty San Antonio Spurs Tuesday night at Sleep Train Arena. 
 
 Tony Parker  notched game-high's in points with 30 points and assists with 11.  Danny Green  had an extremely efficient 21 points on 8-for-11 shooting and  Manu Ginobili  finished with 12 points and seven rebounds on the night for the Spurs (43-12).  
 
 Isaiah Thomas  led the Kings (19-36) with 22 point on 6-for-10 from the field and 8-for-8 from the foul line.  Tyreke Evans  added 20 points and five rebounds, while  DeMarcus Cousins  scored 11 points, grabbed six rebounds and handed out four assists in the loss.  
 
 QUOTABLE : "I can see a whale sighting. I can't tell you how close to shore, but I can see it."  
 -- Sacramento mayor  Kevin Johnson  on how close he is to announcing equity investors willing to match Seattle's offer to purchase the Kings 
 
 THE STAT : The Spurs outshot the Kings 46.7 percent to 37.8 percent, but it wasn't until late in the fourth that they eventually put the home team away.  
 
 TURNING POINT : Down 85-81 with just under nine minutes remaining in the fourth, the Kings went cold and the Spurs used a 7-0 run to pull away.  The Kings kept it close down the stretch, but never recovered from the lapse.   
 
 QUOTABLE II : "He's a great point guard, a great player and he leads that team. They're a great team and I love the way San Antonio plays."  
 -- Sacramento's Isaiah Thomas 
 
 HOT : Fresh off an 18-point,10-assist performance in the Rising Stars Challenge at All-Star Weekend, Thomas came out on fire, scoring 14 points on 4-for-6 shooting in the first half.  
 
 NOT : The Sacramento Kings shot 18.2 percent in the first quarter on 4-for-22 shooting and somehow only trailed by nine at 28-19.  
 
 GOOD MOVE : Coach  Greg Popovich  went to  Boris Diaw  to start the second half and the veteran forward really opened up the spacing for the Spurs on the offensive end.  
 
 BAD MOVE: John Salmons  is mired in an extended slump and he extended that tonight, finishing with just six points on 2-for-6 shooting in 28 minutes.  
 
 NOTABLE : Thomas went 8-for-8 from the free-throw line, extending his made free throw streak to 43.  The Spurs have won four straight and 15 of their last 16 games, overall. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Spurs, Thursday @ Clippers, Friday @ Clippers, Sunday @ Phoenix. For the Kings, Thursday @ Atlanta, Saturday @ New Orleans, Monday @ Miami.
