  Notebook: Thunder 122, Bobcats 95 Posted Saturday March 10, 2012 11:21PM By Randy Renner, NBA.com THE FACTS:  Just before Saturday's game against Charlotte, Oklahoma City Thunder coach  Scott Brooks  said he was still "angry" about Friday's disappointing loss to Cleveland and Saturday night his team played like it was in a foul mood too. The Thunder trio of  Kevin Durant  (26 points),  Russell Westbrook  (23 points) and  James Harden  (career high 32 points) led OKC to a 122-95 win over the visiting Bobcats. Charlotte was led by 22 points from  D.J. Augustin  and 21 from  Corey Maggette . The Bobcats came in as the worst-shooting team in the NBA (41.4 percent) and they couldn't even quite match that (40.9 percent) against the Thunder defense. Meanwhile, Oklahoma City's offense was clicking to the tune of 63 percent. The game was back-and-forth for much of the first quarter, then the Thunder used a 30-15 second quarter to sprint away and secure the team's 32nd win. QUOTABLE:  "Our guys look forward to the next game after a loss. We showed the film (from Friday's loss) and guys saw several times when we didn't play with enough energy and effort. Tonight I give the guys credit they came out and really played well."   -- Brooks THE STAT:  Through three quarters the Thunder trio of Durant, Westbrook and Harden hit more baskets (27) and scored more points (76) than the entire Charlotte roster (24 baskets and 70 points). TURNING POINT:  Early in the second quarter Charlotte hit two straight baskets to get within two points (31-29) from there though the Thunder defense forced seven straight missed shots and the Bobcats turned the ball over twice. That led to a 13-0 OKC run that extended to a 26-6 run and a 22-point Thunder lead (57-35) late in the second quarter. QUOTABLE II:  "I think if our first unit continues to play like that against most teams, teams that aren't as good as this one (OKC) then we will be up like we were in the first quarter. We have to play better."   -- Bobcats head coach  Paul Silas QUOTABLE III:  "Last night (the loss to the Cavs) was a big lesson for us. Sometimes it's good to be humbled. I was proud of the guys tonight. Everybody was moving the ball (27 assists) it's a good bounce back win but we've gotta keep pushing and keep getting better."   -- Durant, on the Thunder's bounce-back win HOT:  OKC hit six of its first eight shots (75 percent) and finished the first quarter shooting 61.1 percent (11-for-18) ... Westbrook started the game 6-for-6 with 13 points in the first nine minutes ... Harden was 7-for-10 (22 points) in the first half ... Westbrook, Harden and Kevin Durant were a combined 21-for-28 (75 percent) in the first half ... In the fourth quarter Bobcats center  Byron Mullens  was 6-for-7 (12 points)... NOT:  Charlotte was just 8-for-22 (36.4 percent) in the first quarter and finished the first half 13-for-43 (30.2 percent) ... Bobcats center  Bismack Biyombo  and guard  Gerald Henderson  were each 3-for-10. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Despite bad weather outside another sellout crowd filled Chesapeake Energy Arena, the 34th consecutive regular season sellout. BAD MOVE:  Silas opted to start  Tyrus Thomas  for the second straight game but Thomas started poorly going just 1-for-5 (2 points) in the first half. NOTABLE:  Harden has set a new career high twice in the last three games (30 points vs. Phoenix on Wednesday and 32 tonight) ... The Thunder's 63 percent shooting night is the sixth-best in franchise history and the best since January 21, 2002 when the then Seattle SuperSonics hit 66.1 percent against the 76ers ... Oklahoma City is now 8-1 this season in games played following a loss and 11-3 on the second night of a back-to-back... UP NEXT:  For the Bobcats, Monday @ New Orleans, Wednesday @ Houston, Thursday @ Dallas. For the Thunder, Tuesday vs. Houston, Thursday @ Denver, Friday vs. San Antonio.
