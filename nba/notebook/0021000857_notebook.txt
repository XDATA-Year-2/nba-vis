The Hawks have a trade pending that would deal starting point guard  Mike Bibby  plus reserve swingman  Maurice Evans  and reserve guard  Jordan Crawford , coach  Larry Drew  confirmed. So the three sat out the game. Drew didn't mention the trade partner but the deal is believed to be for  Kirk Hinrich  and  Hilton Armstrong  of the Washington Wizards. "It's no secret we have been trying to improve our point guard position," Drew said. "Hopefully, this trade goes through." The Hawks battled gamely, even tying it up 92-92 in the closing minutes before the Suns pulled away. For the Suns,  Channing Frye  had 20 points while  Jared Dudley  added 17 off the bench.  Steve Nash  had 13 points and 10 assists but was charged with seven turnovers.  Hakim Warrick  had a nice game in reserve, shooting 4-for-4 for 10 points. Josh Smith  led the Hawks with a game-high 26 points. The Suns (28-27) moved to within two games of Memphis (32-27) for the No. 8 and final playoff spot in the West. The Hawks fell to 34-23. QUOTABLE:  "We're approaching this like a college season. We had 28 games left. We don't have a conference tournament. So we have to get an at-large bid....But we don't want to be the 65 or 66 team."    -- Suns coach  Alvin Gentry  on his team's playoff chances. THE STAT:  The Suns  Marcin Gortat  rolled up his ninth double-double (13 points, game-high 12 rebounds), most in the NBA by any player coming off the bench (the Lakers'  Lamar Odom  has eight). TURNING POINT:  After  Joe Johnson  tied the game at 92-92 with a 3-pointer with 5:00 left, the Suns went on an 8-0 run to wrap it up. Frye hit a 12-footer and a 20-footer during the run. QUOTABLE II:  "Grant was great defensively on Joe Johnson."    -- Alvin Gentry, giving his seemingly nightly tribute to Grant Hill's defense. Johnson had a quiet 5-for-13, 12-point, four-turnover game. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Frye hit the 20-plus point mark for the third straight game, the second such streak of his career. He is averaging 25.0 points for the past three games and 22.0 for his last four. In those four games, he is shooting 73 percent from 2-point range and 55 percent on 3-pointers. NOTABLE:  The Suns are 42-19 after the All Star break (29-5 at home) in Gentry's tenure. He took over as head coach at the break two years ago. Gentry also is now 100-68 as the Suns' head coach. UP NEXT:  For the Hawks, Friday @ Golden State. Sunday @ Portland, Monday @ Denver.. For the Suns, Friday @ Toronto, Sunday @ Indiana and Monday @ New Jersey..
