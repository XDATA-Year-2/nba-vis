 THE FACT:  Miami Heat starters got the fourth quarter off for the second straight night in a 120-92 rout of the Orlando Magic. 
 
 THE LEAD:   LeBron James  had 21 points, six rebounds and seven assists, and seven Heat players (not including James) made 3-pointers in Miami's fifth straight win. 
 
 Arron Afflalo  scored a game-high 30 points for the Magic, who erased a 16-0 deficit but faded in the second half, giving up 120 points for the third time this season. 
 
 Chris Bosh  had 18 points for Miami and  James Jones  led the three-point barrage, making 5-of-7 and totaling 17 points. 
 The Heat made its first seven shots of the game and nine of its first 12 3-point shots. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "LeBron came down (in the Heat's 36-point third quarter) and imposed his will on the game. A lot of times after halftime they make adjustments and they come out and get in fourth or fifth gear." 
 -- Magic coach  Jacque Vaughn 
 
 
 THE STAT:  It was the first game in NBA history in which both teams made at least 15 3-pointers while shooting more than 50 percent from 3-point range. Miami was 15-for-24 (62.5 percent); Orlando shot 15-for-29 (51.7 percent). 
 
 THE STAT II:  James is the first player since  Shaquille O'Neal  in 1997 to average 25-plus ppg on 60 percent or better shooting through the first 12 games of a season. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Miami led, 33-32, having squandered its early 16-point lead, when James came off the bench with 6:46 left in the first half. He scored eight points and assisted two 3-pointers on a 16-7 run that pushed the Heat's lead back to 10. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "When I get out on the floor, I am extremely happy and extremely blessed to know that this game can be taken away from us at any day. You never know what can happen." 
 -- James 
 
 
 HOT:  A 30 percent 3-point shooter last season, Afflalo shot 7-for-9 Wednesday night and is 33-for-61 (54.1 percent) for the season. 
 
 NOT:  The Magic couldn't make anything (14-for-42) from inside the arc. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "Throughout the course of the game I thought our effort defensively was good. It was really the turnovers (14 in the first half) that were troubling us for a while." 
 -- Heat coach  Erik Spoelstra 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Dwyane Wade  sat out another game with a balky post-surgical knee. The Heat didn't need him. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Sensing contact and anticipating a whistle, James flipped up a half-court scoop that missed badly in the third quarter -- and got no call. 
 
 IN THE ARENA:  Tampa Bay Buccaneers cornerback  Darrelle Revis  and former Magic forward  Grant Hill  were in the front row.  
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  The Magic's Victor  Oladipo  followed a nine-turnover game with eight, but did score 20 points and post five steals in his first start. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Magic center  Nik Vucevic , who had three huge games against the Heat last season, had six points, six rebounds and six fouls ... Last in the NBA in rebound percentage, the Heat out-rebounded the Magic, 40-25. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Heat: Saturday vs. Orlando, Monday vs. Phoenix, Wednesday @ Cleveland. For the Magic: Saturday @ Miami, Sunday vs. Phoenix, Tuesday @ Atlanta.
