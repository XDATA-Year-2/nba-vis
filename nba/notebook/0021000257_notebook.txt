  Nets-Knicks notebook   By Adam Zagoria, for NBA.com Posted Tuesday November 30, 2010 10:39PM THE FACTS:   Amar'e Stoudemire  put up 35 points and nine rebounds and Raymond Felton had 21 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds as the Knicks beat the Nets 111-100 at Madison Square Garden for their seventh victory in eight games. QUOTABLE:  "In the third quarter, he had fire in his eyes."    -- Knicks guard  Landry Fields  on Stoudemire THE STAT:  The Knicks were 25-for-29 from the free-throw line. They entered play fourth in the league in FTA (28.72) and fifth in free-throw percentage (.799). TURNING POINT:  The Knicks rattled off a 14-2 run, including eight unanswered points, to turn a 65-63 deficit into a 77-67 lead late in the third quarter. The Knicks outscored the Nets 33-15 in the third period, getting 12 from Stoudemire and eight from Felton. QUOTABLE II:  "Any kind of step forward, we're taking. We're 10-9 but we are playing better and we can play a lot better than this."    -- Knicks coach  Mike D'Antoni HOT:  The Knicks had no answer for Nets center  Brook Lopez , who scored 36 points, one shy of his career high 37 set last March against Detroit. HOTTER:  Stoudemire scored 30 or more points for the second straight game. He had 37 in the double-overtime win Sunday in Detroit and has scored 30 or more four times this season. INSIDE THE ARENA:  NBA commissioner  David Stern , SI swimsuit model  Jessica White  and actor  John Turturro  sat courtside. ROOKIE WATCH:   Derrick Favors , the No. 3 pick in last summer's Draft, was a complete non-factor for New Jersey, managing just two points and four rebounds in 14 minutes.

I think we'd more like to resemble the Lakers."    -- Nets owner  Mikhail Prokhorov  earlier this week UP NEXT:  For the Knicks, Friday @ New Orleans, Sunday at Toronto, Monday vs. Minnesota.
