  Grizzlies-Trail Blazers notebook   By Kerry Eggers, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday April 13, 2011 2:10AM THE FACTS:   LaMarcus Aldridge  collected 22 points and 11 rebounds as the Portland Trail Blazers bounced Memphis 102-89 Tuesday night at the Rose Garden.  Rudy Fernandez  and  Nicolas Batum  added 18 and 16 points off the bench, respectively, as the Blazers (48-33) clinched the sixth spot in the Western Conference playoff picture. QUOTABLE:  "We didn't play sharp basketball. We lost focus when they didn't play their guys (starters  Zach Randolph  and  Tony Allen ). We played down to the level of the competition, but we got it done (gaining the sixth seed). The next goal is to get out of the first round."    -- Portland coach  Nate McMillan THE STAT:  The teams were almost identical in field-goal percentage (Portland .450, Memphis .456) and 3-point percentage (.500 both). The Blazers won the game at the foul line, making 21 of 23 (.913) to 11 of 18 (.611) for the Grizzlies. TURNING POINT:  Portland led only 78-73 with nine minutes left when Rudy Fernandez's trey keyed a 7-0 surge that gave the Blazers an 85-73 advantage. Memphis never got closer than eight points the rest of the way. QUOTABLE II:  "Tony's hurt, and I didn't want to play Zach these last two (regular-season) games because I wanted to get him rested and fresh. He hurt his elbow, and he has the bad knee. I didn't want to have him out here banging for two more games when we have the playoffs coming."    -- Memphis coach Lionel Hollins HOT:  Fernandez was 5-for-6, including 4-for-5 from 3-point range, in scoring 18 points in 28 minutes off the bench. In his previous three games, Fernandez was 1-for-15 shooting -- 0-for-11 on 3-point attempts. NOT:  Batum contributed 16 points and five rebounds, but the reserve forward started the game 1-for-7 and finished 4-for-14 shooting. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Aldridge's 22 points and 11 rebounds produced his 24th 20/10 performance of the campaign. GOOD MOVE:  McMillan treated it almost as a playoff game, using his regular rotation while playing each starter between 29 and 35 minutes. He'll be able to rest anyone he wants in the Blazers' regular-season finale Wednesday night at Golden State. BAD MOVE:  It seems as if Hollins could have played Randolph and Allen limited minutes and still accomplished his goal of rest. He could have sat them in Wednesday's regular-season finale against the L.A. Clippers. Maybe the Grizzlies are hoping for the eighth seed and a first-round matchup with San Antonio, with whom they split 2-2 this season. ROOKIE WATCH:  Memphis backup point guard Ish Smith saw 13 minutes, going for six points and two assists. NOTABLE:  Portland's  Gerald Wallace  got all of his 14 points and four rebounds in the second half. UP NEXT:  For the Blazers, Wednesday @ Golden State; For the Grizzlies, Wednesday @ L.A. Clippers
