  Knicks-Pacers notebook   By Conrad Brunner, for NBA.com Posted Monday April 11, 2011 12:22AM THE FACTS: Carmelo Anthony  made a 19-footer with 4.9 seconds left, and then blocked  Danny Granger's  19-footer, to lift New York to its seventh straight win, 110-109, over Indiana in the Pacers' final home game of the regular season Sunday night in Conseco Fieldhouse. The Knicks (42-38) scored the final seven points of the game to erase a 109-103 deficit as the Pacers missed their final six shots. Anthony finished with a game-high 34 for the Knicks, who took a one-game lead over Philadelphia in the race for sixth in the Eastern Conference. Granger led Indiana (37-44) with 20. QUOTABLE:  "(The game-winning play) was designed for  Chauncey (Billups)  to come off and me to come and get the ball. But they denied it. I told Chauncey to throw it over the top. The shot was cool but they still had time to come back down and get a shot. I just buckled down and made a great defensive stop out there."   --  Anthony. THE STAT:  Anthony is now 19-of-39 (.487) in his career on shots that either tie or give his team in the lead in the final 10 seconds of a game. TURNING POINT:  The Pacers put together a 16-5 run spanning the third and fourth periods to a 98-87 lead with 11:39 remaining. Thereafter, Indiana missed 16 of 20 shots and committed six turnovers as the Knicks took control down the stretch. QUOTABLE II:  "(Anthony)'s one of the best in the world. He made a terrific shot. It was well defended. What we take from this game is in the fourth quarter we have to counter what they throw at us. I thought we competed tonight. We just didn't close it out."   --  Indiana interim coach  Frank Vogel . HOT: Mike Dunleavy  scored 14 points in 19 minutes off the Indiana bench, hitting 6-of-11 shots. NOT:  The Knicks' two top scorers, Anthony and Billups, combined to shoot 15-of-42 (.357) from the field. NOTABLE: Amar'e Stoudemire  missed his third game of the season and second in a row with a sprained left ankle. New York is 3-0 in his absence... Asked if Stoudemire would play in either of the final two regular-season games, coach  Mike D'Antoni  said "I kind of hope it happens but we won't know till he says he can go." ... Pacers veteran point guard  T.J. Ford  played for the first time since Jan. 28, going scoreless in four minutes. Ford has replaced  Lance Stephenson  as the third guard in the rotation, the result of a disciplinary action for an undisclosed violation of team rules by the rookie...Indiana outscored the Knicks, 48-18, in the paint tonight....New York's 38 attempts from the 3-point line are the most ever against the Pacers in their NBA history...Anthony has averaged 30.9 points in the Knicks' seven-game win streak, hitting 23-of-48 (.479) from the 3-point line. UP NEXT:  For the Pacers, Wednesday @ Orlando. For the Knicks, Tuesday vs. Chicago, Wednesday @ Boston.
