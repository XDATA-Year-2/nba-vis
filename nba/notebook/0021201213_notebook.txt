 THE FACTS:   The Raptors ripped the host Hawks 113-96 Tuesday, and with the way  DeMar DeRozan ,  Rudy Gay  and company are playing, they look like they're going to the postseason rather than the playoff-bound opponent they drilled. DeRozan scored 30 points and Gay added 22. Even though they did not play in the fourth quarter, the Raptors (33-48) won their fourth straight game -- all over playoff-bound opponents --  as the defenseless Hawks hardly put up a challenge. 
 
 Al Horford  sat out the Hawks' home finale with a sore left shoulder, and the center wasn't the only Atlanta player who rested. 
 Other than Horford's stand-in ( Johan Petro ), no Hawks starter played more than 18:24. 
 Toronto led 68-51 at halftime after DeRozan scored 19 points, Gay added 17 and the Raptors shot 66.7 percent. Their 38-point second quarter and 68-point half were season highs. 
 The visitors led 96-75 after three periods.  
 Toronto has beaten the Bulls twice, the Nets and the Hawks consecutively. The Raptors also have won six of their past seven, and are 16-16 since acquiring Gay by trade.  
 
 Kyle Korver  was the only Atlanta starter in double figures, with 13 points. Reserves  Ivan Johnson   (12 points, 10 rebounds) and rookie  Mike Scott  (12, 12) were solid off the bench. 
 With the loss, the Hawks (44-37) are tied with Chicago (44-37) for the No. 5 spot in the East, which will meet No. 4 Brooklyn in the first round. The Bulls hold a tiebreaker over the Hawks.  
 One of those teams will end up No. 6 -- drawing  Indiana in the first round -- opposite Miami's bracket.  
 Atlanta plays at New York  on Wednesday, when the Bulls host the Wizards.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I've said it the last few days . . . I'm going to err on the side of caution given that Al is a little sore, and I thought Josh [Smith] looked a little gimpy tonight as well. Then, he banged knees and decided to rest in the second half. My focus right now is to try to keep this team competing at a high level, which I didn't think we did in the first half." 
 -- Hawks coach  Larry Drew 
 
 
 THE STAT:   17 shots-38 points -- The Raptors scored a season-high 38 points in the second quarter on just 17 shots. They made 12 (70.6 percent), including 4-for-5 3-pointers and 10-for-11 from the free throw line. The never drew closer than 11 points in the third quarter. 
 
 TURNING POINT:   The Hawks led 19-18 in the first quarter after rookie  Mike Scott  made an alley oop, and then missed 12 of their next 15 shots as the Raptors took a 30-23 lead. Five of the misses were dunks, layups or tips and two more were shots inside five feet. Meanwhile, Toronto shot 6-for-8 to turn the game for good. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We are just playing free out there; we're playing off of instance instead of thinking so much. We have a lot of talent on this team. When we play like we did tonight, we're a tough team to beat." 
 -- DeRozan. 
 
 
 HOT:   DeRozan has averaged 33 points over his past two games on 23-for-38 shooting. He scored nine points in the first quarter, 10 in the second and 11 in the third before sitting out the fourth.  
 
 NOT:   Devin Harris  shot 2-for-8 for the Hawks, making him 7-for-27 over Atlanta's past two games, and 9-for-33 over the past three. Toronto's  Alan Anderson  shot 1-for-9, and is 4-for-20 over the past three games.  
 
 NOTABLE:   Atlanta's Smith played just 12:44, and is battling tendinitis in a knee. ... Korver was 3-for-4 from distance, stretching his streak to 73 straight games making at least one 3-pointer. That's the fourth-longest streak in NBA history. ... Toronto rookie guard  Terrence Ross  aggravated his sprained left ankle in the fourth quarter and did not return. He missed the two previous games because of the injury. ... Horford is expected to travel with the Hawks for Atlanta's regular-season finale at New York. ... Atlanta won the season series against Toronto, 2-1. ... Hawks guard-forward  DeShawn Stevenson  missed the game with a cold.  
 
 UP NEXT:   For the Raptors, Wednesday vs. Boston. For the Hawks, Wednesday @ New York.
