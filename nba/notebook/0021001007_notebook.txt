  Magic-Bucks notebook   By Rick Braun, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday March 16, 2011 11:51PM THE FACTS:   Dwight Howard  had 31 points and 21 rebounds, and  Hedo Turkoglu  added 19 points, including eight in overtime, as the Orlando Magic clinched a playoff spot with a 93-89 victory over the  Andrew Bogut -less Milwaukee Bucks Wednesday night at the Bradley Center. QUOTABLE:  "You have to give a lot of credit to their guys on a back-to-back. They played harder than us. They had a lot of movement and a lot of energy, so we have to give them credit. But at the end we just knew how to execute better and make some big plays. We made some big shots and put the game away."   -- Hedo Turkoglu THE STAT:  While Howard attempted 24 free throws himself and the Magic had 35 attempts as a team, the Bucks went to the line just 17 times. With Bogut out, Bucks big men  Larry Sanders  and  Jon Brockman  fouled out and  Earl Barron  finished with five fouls. TURNING POINT:  With the score tied 87-87, Turkoglu beat the shot clock with a 20-footer from the left baseline with 1:00 left in overtime. After Barron missed for Milwaukee,  Jameer Nelson  hit a jump shot -- also as the shot clock was expiring -- with 23.5 seconds left, and the Magic finally shook off the pesky Bucks. QUOTABLE II:  "I'm happy to get out of here with a win. We did about everything wrong we could do at the end. Another game with 19 turnovers, we didn't make any free throws, we couldn't stop them. But we got out with the win, so I'm happy."   -- Orlando coach  Stan Van Gundy HOT:  Howard made 9-for-12 from the field to improve his season shooting percentage to 59.7 percent (534-for-894) -- second in the league. NOT:  Howard went 13-for-24 from the line (54.2 percent) and is just 58.5 percent (450-for-769) for the season. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Howard's numbers of 31 and 22 (eight offensive) along with three blocks are certain to please fantasy owners . BAD MOVE:  Nelson tried to grab  Brandon Jennings  before he could get a shot going to prevent a tying 3-pointer near the end of regulation. Instead, Nelson fouled Jennings too late, and the foul resulted in three free throws that Jennings made to send the game to overtime at 79-79. ROOKIE WATCH:  Sanders started in place of Bogut but had just four points and no rebounds and he fouled out in 18 minutes against Howard. NOTABLE:  Bogut missed the game because of a migraine headache. ... After baskets by Sanders and  John Salmons  gave the Bucks a 13-10 lead, Milwaukee missed its next 14 shots from the field and committed three turnovers over the next 7 ½ minutes.  Jason Richardson 's 3-pointer started a 17-1 run. After that, the Bucks made their next five field goals. ... Orlando made 18 of its first 30 shots, then made just 15 of its last 46. ... Jennings led the Bucks with 23 points, and Salmons had 22 -- 16 in the third quarter. UP NEXT:  For the Magic, Friday vs. Denver, Monday @ Cleveland, Wednesday @ New York. For the Bucks, Friday vs. New Jersey, Sunday vs. New York, Wednesday vs. Sacramento.
