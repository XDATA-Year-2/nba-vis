  Thunder-Trail Blazers notebook   By Kerry Eggers, for NBA.com Posted Saturday April 2, 2011 1:48AM THE FACTS: LaMarcus Aldridge  scored 32 points as the Trail Blazers overcame a slow start to defeat Oklahoma City 98-91 Friday night at the Rose Garden. The Thunder (50-25) led by as many as 12 points in the first quarter, but cold shooting spelled doom for the Northwest Division leaders. The win prevented a season sweep for Oklahoma City, which had won the first three games of the series. QUOTABLE:  "Gut check for us tonight. We got to the free-throw line and did a much better job taking care of the ball. (The Thunder) got off to a red-hot start, but we found a way to win. We got stops and made plays down the stretch."   --  Portland coach  Nate McMillan. THE STAT:  OKC's  Kevin Durant  was 9 for 24 from the field ? 6 for 10 in the first half, 0 for 10 in the game's next 22 1/2 minutes and 3 for 4 over the final 90 seconds. TURNING POINT:  Oklahoma City led 65-57 early in the third quarter when Portland went on a 15-0 run to go ahead 72-65. The Thunder never led again. QUOTABLE II:  "I'm not going to worry about starting or coming off the bench. My goal is more to finish the game, like tonight. Be aggressive on offense and defense and don't think about starting or not."   --  Portland's  Nicolas Batum , who scored 19 points, 14 in the first half, in his first game as a reserve since Dec. 13. HOT:  Oklahoma City made its first six shots from the field in jumping to a 16-8 lead. The Thunder shot .564 in the first half in mounting a 59-53 lead. NOT:  Ahead 65-57, the Thunder missed seven shots in a row to fall behind 70-65. They made only 10 of 39 shots (25.6 percent) in the second half. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Portland's LaMarcus Aldridge reached the 30-point plateau for the 12th time this season (32) and grabbed eight rebounds. Oklahoma City's  Russell Westbrook  collected 16 points, nine rebounds and six assists. INSIDE THE ARENA:  The Trail Blazers and Northwest Autism Foundation played host to "Autism Awareness Night" at the Rose Garden.  Sarah Mensah , Portland's chief operating officer, is a single parent to a son with autism. Mensah serves on the NWAF board and is spokesperson for its organization. INSIDE THE ARENA II:  Actor  Dan Aykroyd  was at courtside, sitting next to friend  Paul Allen , the Blazers' owner. GOOD MOVE:  McMillan called timeout with OKC ahead 65-57 early in the third quarter, imploring his players to extend out more on Thunder shooters. Something worked. BAD MOVE:  Ahead by eight points in the third quarter, the Thunder settled for perimeter shots. And suddenly, they weren't falling. Portland wound up winning the points-in-the-paint battle 34-30. NOTABLE:  Portland scored 15 points off 17 Oklahoma City turnovers. The Blazers committed a season-low five turnovers, resulting in five Thunder points.
