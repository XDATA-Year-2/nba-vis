
 Pacers-Spurs notebook   By Tim Price, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday October 27, 2010 11:57PM THE FACTS Tim Duncan  started his 14th season by scoring 23 points on 10-of-12 shooting and had 12 rebounds as the San Antonio Spurs defeated the Indiana Pacers 122-109 Wednesday at AT&T Center. QUOTABLE "I don't think Pop's going to be too happy about (scoring 122 points every game). Not the kind of games we want to have. To have that ability to go out there and be able to put up 120 points is great for us. We just don't want to give up 100-plus every night."    -- Tim Duncan THE STAT After scoring one point and turning the ball over twice in the first half, Spurs backup guard  George Hill  went 4-of-8 without a turnover after halftime to end up leading the Spurs' bench scoring with 16 points (San Antonio had a 32-17 edge in bench points). Hill connected on a four-point play that gave the Spurs a 15-point lead with 6 ½ minutes to play. TURNING POINT Richard Jefferson  missed the final 4 ½ minutes of the first half after picking up his third foul -- and played only 39 seconds of the third quarter when he picked up his fourth. But he opened the fourth quarter with a 3-pointer and sparked San Antonio to a decisive 18-6 run during the next 5:15. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT Averaging 11.7 points per game last season, Pacers center  Roy Hibbert  scored 28 points and had nine rebounds and three blocked shots. ROOKIE WATCH James Anderson , the Spurs' No. 1 pick (20th overall) out of Oklahoma State, made two of his first three shots -- all 3-pointers -- and finished with 10 points on 4-of-8 shooting from the floor in 27 minutes. NOTABLE Key Spurs reserve  Matt Bonner  left the floor with about three minutes left in the third quarter after suffering a sprained right ankle. X-rays taken at the arena were negative, but no definite timetable has been announced for Bonner's return. UP NEXT For the Pacers, Friday @ Charlotte, Saturday vs. Philadelphia, Wednesday @ Philadelphia. For the Spurs, Saturday vs. New Orleans, Monday @ Clippers, Wednesday @ Phoenix.
