  Celtics-Knicks notebook   By Adam Zagoria, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday December 15, 2010 10:36PM THE FACTS:   Paul Pierce  hit a step-back jumper to break a 116-all tie with .4 seconds left and  Amar'e Stoudemire 's 3-pointer at the buzzer was disallowed, enabling the Celtics to extend their winning streak to 11 games with a 118-116 thriller over the Knicks at Madison Square Garden. The Knicks' eight-game winning streak came to an end. QUOTABLE:  "It felt good. It just happened to be a second late."    -- Amar'e Stoudemire on the shot THE STAT:  Pierce, who said Tuesday that there wouldn't be a Knicks-Celtics rivalry until after he left the NBA, finished with 32 points and 10 rebounds. TURNING POINT:  After a Celtics 20-second timeout, Pierce jab-stepped toward Stoudemire and then stepped back to drain a jumper from the right side, giving the Celts a 118-116 led. QUOTABLE II:  "[It was a] high screen and roll to a switch. He was able to get the step back and he hit the jumper."    -- Amar'e Stoudemire on Paul Pierce's jumper HOT:  Stoudemire now has nine straight games of 30 points or more. He tied his season-high with 39 points and added 10 rebounds. NOT:  The Knicks' bench continues to struggle, managing just seven points. Head coach  Mike D'Antoni  played only one reserve,  Toney Douglas , for more than 10 minutes. INSIDE THE ARENA:   Donald Trump ,  Jamie-Lynn Sigler ,  Fabolous  and  Spike Lee  were courtside. Spike sported a No. 6  Landry Fields  jersey. Asked if he planned to run for President in 2012, Trump said, "Maybe." ROOKIE WATCH:  Filling in for  Shaquille O'Neal  (calf), Turkish center  Semih Erden  had six points and three rebounds for the Celtics. UP NEXT:  For the Knicks, Friday vs. Miami, Saturday @ Cleveland, Wednesday vs. Oklahoma City. For the Celtics, Thursday vs. Atlanta, Sunday vs. Indiana, Wednesday vs. Philadelphia.
