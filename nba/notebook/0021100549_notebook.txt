  Notebook: Nets 104, Bobcats 101 Posted Sunday March 4, 2012 9:48PM By Brian Joura, for NBA.com THE FACTS:   Deron Williams  scored the most points in a game so far in the 2011-12 NBA season and the Nets needed nearly every one of them as they held on for a 104-101 win over the Bobcats Sunday night in Charlotte. Williams had a career-high 57 points, six more than  Kevin Durant's  previous season-best mark. He went 16-29 from the floor, hit four 3-point buckets and was a perfect 21-21 from the foul line. Williams tallied 22 points in the third quarter alone, which allowed the Nets to rally from an eight-point halftime deficit. The Nets built a 101-94 lead with 37 seconds remaining but had to sweat out the final seconds as  D.J. Augustin's  long-distance three-pointer failed at the buzzer. QUOTABLE:  "I think we're a much better team when Deron's aggressive. We're going to be a much better team not only when Brook (Lopez) scores but when Deron scores the basketball."   -- Nets coach  Avery Johnson  prior to the game THE STAT:  The 57 points scored by Williams was the second-most ever against the Bobcats.  Kobe Bryant  put up 58 against Charlotte on December 29, 2006. TURNING POINT:  The Bobcats had a 16-point lead late in the second quarter, which the Nets whittled down to nine at the half. When  Kemba Walker  came on after Augustin picked up his fourth foul with 7:03 remaining in the third quarter, Williams scored the next 15 points for New Jersey, giving the visitors a five-point lead. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Walker came onto the court late in the first quarter wearing neon-orange shoes. ROOKIE WATCH:  Walker scored 14 points and was 8-8 from the free-throw line. NOTABLE:  Williams' previous high for points this year was 38 points, which he eclipsed in the third quarter. His previous career-high was 42 points, which he netted on April 6, 2010 versus Oklahoma City. NOTABLE II:  This was the first time in 21 games that the Bobcats reached triple-digits in points. UP NEXT:  For the Bobcats, Tuesday vs. Magic, Wednesday vs Jazz, Friday vs. Nets. For the Nets, Tuesday @ Miami, Wednesday vs. Clippers, Friday at Charlotte.
