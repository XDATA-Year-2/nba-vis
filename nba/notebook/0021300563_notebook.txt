 THE FACT:   Indiana's victory sent  Frank Vogel  and his staff to the NBA All-Star Game to coach the Eastern Conference team on Feb. 16 in New Orleans. He is the fourth Pacers coach to do so, following  Larry Bird  in 1998,  Isiah Thomas Thomas  in 2003 and  Rick Carlisle  in 2004.  
 
 THE LEAD:  The Indiana defense could not manage another season-low but the offense produced a season-high.  Paul George  broke out of a slump with 31 points, 24 in the second half to lead the Pacers to a 116-92 victory over Sacramento before 17,530 Tuesday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. In addition to the point total, the Pacers (30-7) shot a season-high .549 from the field while snapping the Kings' three-game win streak. Sacramento (13-23) got 31 points and 13 rebounds from  DeMarcus Cousins . 
 
 QUOTABLE:   "A complete game for our guys. They got going a little in the third quarter, Cousins in particular had a spectacular quarter but so did Paul George and our bench came in to start the fourth and busted the game open. It wasn't our best defensive effort, but pretty good, and offensively we moved the basketball well, got to the line and took care of business." 
 --  Vogel 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Sacramento had scored in triple figures in 12 consecutive games, averaging 107.8 points, but did come close to extending that streak. Aside from Cousins, the rest of the Kings combined to shoot 27-for-71 (.380). 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Kings took a 33-32 lead on  Aaron Gray's  jumper early in the second quarter but the Indiana second unit did most of the damage in a 23-5 run that pushed the Pacers into a 55-38 lead. During the six and 1/2-minute span of the run, the Kings shot 1-for-7 with six turnovers while the Pacers shot 9-for-10. Despite 19 points and 10 points from Cousins in the third quarter, the Kings could get no closer than eight, largely because George answered with 14 of his own including a buzzer-beating banked 3-pointer that put Indiana ahead 86-74 entering the fourth. Again the second unit took over with a 17-4 run that put it out of reach. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We just played Pacers basketball, to be honest. They've got a lot of guys that can put the ball in the basket, so we contested shots, funneled everything into  Roy (Hibbert)  and that's when we're at our best." 
 -- George on the Indiana defense. 
 
 
 HOT:  George shot 10-for-18, including 4-for-7 from the 3-point line. ... West was 7-for-11,  Lance Stephenson  5-for-7 and  C.J. Watson  5-for-6 for Indiana. ... Cousins shot 12-for-21. 
 
 NOT:   Rudy Gay  managed just 12 points on 6-for-14 shooting, and guards  Isaiah Thomas  and  Marcus Thornton  combined for 14 points on 6-for-16 shooting.  
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "They are a great defensive team but I thought we reverted back to our old ways tonight. We have to do a better job of proving we are a changed team." 
 - Gay 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Indiana won its eighth consecutive home game and improved its home record to 19-1. ... The Pacers became the first Eastern Conference team to reach 30 wins, doing so in the fewest games in the team's NBA history. ... The 34 points in the second quarter, 59 in the first half, and 25 on the fast break all were season highs for Indiana. ... The Kings outscored the pacers 56-50 in the paint and 22-16 on second-chance points. ... West scored 16 with eight rebounds, Stephenson 13 with five rebounds and five assists, and Watson and Hibbert 10 apiece for Indiana. ... Sacramento, which had played the fewest road games in the league this season, launched a six-game road trip. ... The Kings failed to produce their first four-game win streak since 2011. ... George had shot .347 overall and .209 from the arc in the previous seven games. ... Indiana has held eight consecutive teams to fewer than 100 points. 
 
 UP NEXT:    For the Pacers, Thursday vs. the Knicks, Saturday vs. the Clippers, Monday at Golden State. For the Kings, Wednesday at Minnesota, Friday at Memphis, Sunday at Oklahoma City.
