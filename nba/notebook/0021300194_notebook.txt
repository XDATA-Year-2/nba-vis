 THE FACT:  The Spurs have matched their best start in history by winning their 12th game in 13 outings. To set the franchise record, they need to win 14 of their first 15. The Spurs used a strong defense to build a 40-point lead and hold the the Cavaliers to 30.8 percent shooting. 
 
 THE LEAD: Danny Green  scored 17 points and  Patty Mills  added 15 off the bench as the Spurs (12-1) won their 10th straight game, a 126-96 blowout over Cleveland (4-10) on Saturday at the AT&T Center. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Good, old-fashioned behind kicking. We got our behinds kicked. We didn't do anything well. The only positive, I think, that we got out of this that we got to see how to play the game of basketball the right way." 
 -- Cleveland coach  Mike Brown 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Spurs shot 66.7 percent from behind the arc while the Cavs made only 30.8 percent of their 3-pointers. Green made more treys (five) than the entire Cleveland team (four). 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Spurs extended a nine-point first-quarter lead to 25 with 6:05 left in the half. They outscored the Cavs 35-11 in the second period. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "They're not as bad as it seemed tonight. And we're not as good as it seems. We just had one of those nights in the positive direction. They had one in the other." 
 -- Spurs coach  Gregg Popovich   
 
 
 HOT:   Tiago Splitter  scored 10 points on 4-for-5 shooting, all in the first half. Over the past three games, he's made 15-for-19 attempts -- 79 percent. 
 
 NOT: Tristan Thompson  missed all but one of the eight shots he attempted in 26 minutes. His lone field goal was a dunk with 6:24 left in the third. In his past three games, Thompson is 7-for-23 from the field.  
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:   Kyrie Irving  started slow in the first half (four points on 2-for-10 shooting). He improved in the second half to finish with 15 points on 7-for-17 shooting. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  The Cavs'  Matthew Dellavedova  scored 16 points, collected four steals, grabbed two rebounds and had two assists in his second start.  
 
 NOTABLE:   Anthony Bennett , the No. 1 overpick draft pick, scored a career-high nine points. He started the fourth quarter with a 19-foot jumper. Less than a minute later, he drained a 3-pointer. Though he wasn't listed as injured, Bennett did not play against New Orleans. In the Cavs' previous four games, he played only twice and scored two points.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Cavaliers, Wednesday vs. Miami, Friday at Boston, Saturday vs. Chicago. For the Spurs, Monday vs. New Orleans, Wednesday at Oklahoma City, Friday at Orlando.
