  Notebook: Thunder 149, Timberwolves 140 Posted Saturday March 24, 2012 12:17AM By Randy Renner, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  Another record setting night in Oklahoma City as the Thunder's  Russell   Westbrook  (45) and  Kevin Durant  (40) combined for 85 points and the Thunder survived a monster game from  Kevin Love  (51 points) to beat the Timberwolves in a thrilling 149-140 double overtime game. It's the first time in NBA history two teammates have scored at least 40 points in two games in the same season. The duo also did it against Denver on February 19th. Westbrook also had six assists and two steals. Durant pulled down 17 rebounds, the second most of his career, and added five assists and three steals. OKC's sixth man  James Harden  dropped in 25 points, grabbed six rebounds and handed out six assists. Love's 51 points are a career high; he also pulled down 14 rebounds. Love was a menace from long range all night going 7-for-11. Backup point guard  J.J. Barea  had 25 points and a career high 14 assists.  Anthony Tolliver  added 23 points. Big minutes for several players, Durant led the way with 52:24, Westbrook played 50:09 and Love was on the court for 49:19. Newly acquired Thunder point guard  Derek Fisher  played two seconds shy of 36 minutes but was just 2-for-11 and scored five points, he handed out three assists and grabbed two rebounds. QUOTABLE:  "I'm sure the fans and players enjoyed this one more than me. Both teams made incredible plays, just plays after plays after plays. Our team never gives up but we never could figure them out and Love had a big game against all our guys."  --  Thunder head coach  Scott Brooks. QUOTABLE II:  "It was a tough loss, a really tough loss. Our guys did everything you could to win the game. They played their tails off."  --  Timberwolves head coach  Rick Adelman. THE STAT:  In the second overtime OKC's Westbrook scored nine points on 4-for-4 shooting and the Thunder was 7-for-8 (87.5 percent) in the final frame and hit all five free throws. TURNING POINT:  The game twisted and turned back and forth most of the night. OKC led by as many as 13 and the Wolves by as many as seven. The Thunder blew a five point lead with 1:41 left in regulation. But Durant hit a long three with 3.6 left and then Love nailed a 3-pointer over Westbrook to send the game into the first overtime. Westbrook's nine points in the second OT proved decisive as the Thunder outscored Minnesota 20-11 in the second overtime. QUOTABLE III:  "We talk trash to each other all the time, he's my guy, he's my main man. He really talked trash to me after he hit that one right in my face. He kept saying, 'in your face, in your face."  --  Westbrook on his friend Love, a former teammate at UCLA. QUOTABLE IV:  "Doesn't matter now with the loss. We needed this game. It's a tough loss but now we go back home and try to get a win."  --  Love on his career night. HOT:  In the first five minutes of the game, T-Wolves forward Love was 4-for-6 (3-for-3 on 3-pointers) and scored 11 points. At halftime he had 19 points on 7-for-12 shooting (5-for-6 on 3-pointers)...OKC's Harden was 7-for-9 (17 points) in the first half... Nick Collison  was 5-for-6 (10 points) in the first half...Minnesota was 23-for-39 (59 percent in the first half and 9-for-14 (64.3 percent) on 3-pointers at the break...Barea was 4-for-4 (10 points) in the second overtime. NOT:  Timberwolves guard Barea was 1-for-4 in the first half...To start the second half Minnesota was just 1-for-8 (12.5 percent) on 3-pointers...Love was 0-for-2 (1 point) in the second overtime. INSIDE THE ARENA:  The Thunder honored a cancer patient from nearby Sulphur, Oklahoma, who kicked in the door of a burning home to save the family inside.  Emily Clark  saw the fire on her way to work early one morning. She called 9-1-1 then fearing there were people trapped inside she broke down a door. The family, including several young children, got out alive. Emily previously worked as a firefighter for the National Parks Service. GOOD MOVE:  Toward the end of the third quarter, Thunder forward Durant fakes to his right, then drives to his left around Tolliver. Tolliver fouls Durant and as he is falling down puts up a shot and drains it. BAD MOVE:  With Minnesota playing forward Love at center, Thunder head coach Brooks opted to have his center,  Kendrick Perkins , guard Love. It didn't work out well in the beginning. Love was 5-for-5 on 3-pointers in the first 20 minutes of the game and had 19 points. BAD MOVE TOO:  Perkins wasn't the only Thunder player having trouble guarding the T-Wolves. Oklahoma City played some of its worst defense of the season in the first half, allowing Minnesota to shoot 59.0 percent, (64.3 percent on 3-pointers) and score 61 points. GOOD MOVE TOO:  In the second half the Thunder switched up some defensive assignments and Love, after going 5-for-6 on 3-pointers in the first half was 0-for-2 in the second half until nailing a game-tying three ball with one second left. NOTABLE:  Oklahoma City has now won 11 straight against Minnesota...The last time two teammates scored 40+ points in a game before this season was February, 18, 1996 when  Michael Jordan  (44) and  Scottie Pippen  (40) did it...The last time the OKC franchise scored 149 points in a game was April 6, 2008 in a 151-147 double OT win against Denver...The 140 points is a season high for Minnesota. UP NEXT:  For the Timberwolves, Sunday vs. Denver, Tuesday @ Memphis, Wednesday @ Charlotte. For the Thunder, Sunday vs. Miami, Tuesday @ Portland, Thursday @ LA Lakers.
