  Pistons-Cavaliers notebook   By Rick Noland, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday February 9, 2011 10:23PM THE FACTS:  Detroit guards  Rodney Stuckey  (22 points) and  Will Bynum  (17) combined for 39 points off the bench as the Pistons defeated Cleveland 103-94. It was the Cavs' 26th straight loss, tying them with the 1976-77 Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the longest losing streak in American major sports history. QUOTABLE:  "That was probably the worst effort we've had in a month. It's that simple. We didn't come ready to compete."    -- Cavs coach  Byron Scott . THE STAT:  The Cavs committed 17 turnovers that led to 24 Detroit points. The Pistons committed only 11 that led to just 10 Cleveland points. TURNING POINT:  The Cavs led early, but Detroit went on an 11-2 run late in the first period to go up nine and never really looked back, leading by as many as 17 while winning for just the seventh time in 28 road games. QUOTABLE II:  "I'm mad as hell. I can deal with losing, especially when guys are playing as hard as we did the last few games. I find it very hard to deal with when guys don't come out ready to play."    -- Byron Scott. HOT:  Stuckey made just 6-for-16 from the field, but he went 8-for-10 from the line and repeatedly got to the basket. Fellow backup guard Bynum was 6-for-10 from the field and 4-for-4 from the line. Both guards penetrated almost at will. When they didn't score, they dished back outside for 3-pointers, as Detroit made 9-for-19 from long range. NOT:  Cleveland's bench had a total of 17 points, with  Daniel Gibson  accounting for 12. Cleveland reserves shot 6-for-15 from the field. Detroit, meanwhile, got 61 points from its reserves, with  Charlie Villanueva  joining Stuckey and Bynum in double figures with 13. NOTABLE:  Detroit reserves outrebounded Cleveland subs 19-6. ... The Cavs have lost 36 of their last 37 games, their one victory coming in overtime at home against the Knicks. ...  Richard Hamilton  did not suit up for Detroit due to a sore groin.
