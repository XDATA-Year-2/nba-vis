 THE FACT:  The Knicks won for the fourth time in seven games and for just the fourth time at home this season. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Carmelo Anthony went for a game-best 35 points, six rebounds and four assists and  Andrea Bargnani  added 23 points and six boards as the Knicks downed the Atlanta Hawks 111-106 at Madison Square Garden. Anthony scored 15 of the Knicks' 30 points in the fourth period.  Tim Hardaway Jr.  added 13 points off the bench. 
 
 Lou Williams  led the Hawks with 27 points, hitting 6-for-13 from three-point range.  Paul Millsap  added 18 points and  Al Horford  tallied 17. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We made shots tonight. We shared the basketball. We did it on the defensive end. Everybody committed themselves, put that game behind us from last night and bounced back so today was a great win for us." 
 -- Carmelo Anthony 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Knicks (7-16) had attempted fewer free throws than their opponents in the last 21 games entering this one. In this game, the Knicks shot 15-for-18 from the stripe and the Hawks 11-for 11. 
 
 THE STAT II:  The Hawks (12-12) went 15-for-32 from the arc, while the Knicks shot 8-for-19. 
 
 THE STAT III:  The Hawks committed 27 turnovers to 11 for the Knicks. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  After the Hawks got within 87-83 in the fourth, the Knicks used an 11-0 run to push the lead to 98-83. Anthony and  Pablo Prigioni  hit back-to-back 3-pointers, Prigioni added a steal and a layup and Bargnani hit a 3-pointer. 
 
 HOT:  Anthony has led the Knicks in scoring in every game this season, except once, when he was tied for the lead. 
 
 COLD:  After shooting just once and scoring two points in Friday's loss at Boston,  J.R. Smith  went 1-for-8 for two points in 24 minutes before going to the bench in the fourth quarter.  Iman Shumpert  went 1-for-3 for three points. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It's not a question of benching [Smith]. Timmy [Hardaway] was going well for us and I decided to go with Timmy and Iman." 
 -- Knicks coach  Mike Woodson 
 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "We was just being active, getting a lot of deflections, getting out in transition, getting easy baskets. Holding them to one shot and getting out and making our offense easy." 
 -- Carmelo Anthony on forcing 27 turnovers 
 
 
 NOTABLE:   Kyle Korver  went 4-for-9 from the arc and finished with 13 points. He has now hit a 3-pointer in 93 straight NBA games, extending his own NBA record.  
 
 NOTABLE II:   Kenyon Martin  (abdominal strain) and  Raymond Felton  (strained left hamstring) sat out for the Knicks. Woodson said Martin "is going to be out a little bit." There is no time frame on how long. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:   Roseanne Cash ,  Olivia Munn  and  Christie Brinkley  sat courtside. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Knicks, Monday vs Washington, Wednesday @ Milwaukee, Saturday vs. Memphis. For the Hawks, Monday vs. L.A. Lakers, Wednesday vs. Sacramento, Friday vs. Utah.
