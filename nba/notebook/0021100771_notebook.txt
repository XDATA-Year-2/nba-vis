  Notebook: Sixers 95, Hawks 90 Posted Saturday March 31, 2012 11:08PM By Rob Maaddi, for NBA.com THE FACTS:   Elton Brand  scored a season-high 25 points, getting 13 in the fourth quarter to help the 76ers beat the Hawks 95-90 on Saturday night at the Wells Fargo Center. It was Philadelphia's third straight win at home and pulled the Sixers within a half-game of Atlantic Division-leading Boston.  Andre Iguodala  added 18 points for the Sixers.  Josh Smith  led the Hawks with a season-best 34 points and  Joe Johnson  had 15. QUOTABLE:  "He looked like he was 23, 24 out there."   --  Evan Turner  on Brand. THE STAT:  Brand had 10 rebounds and five assists. It was the first time he had 20-10-5 since April 15, 2007. TURNING POINT:  After  Marvin Williams  nailed a 3-pointer to get the Hawks within 88-86, Brand knocked down a 14-footer to extend the lead with 90 seconds remaining. HOT:  Brand was 10-for-12 from the floor, posting up with success and hitting short jumpers. NOT:   Jeff Teague  and Williams each shot 2-for-8 for the Hawks. They combined to go 1-for-5 from beyond the arc. QUOTABLE II:  "I was in my best  Tony Robbins  mode tonight. I ran out every motivational phrase I could think of."   --  Doug Collins . FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Brand did it all, shooting, rebounding and even dishing the ball. Smith had 34 points, nine rebounds and six assists. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Former Sixers center  Darryl Dawkins  received a rousing ovation when he was introduced in the first quarter. Team owner  Josh Harris  also sat courtside with his wife on their 17-year wedding anniversary. QUOTABLE III:  "They got our number right now. This team I am sure believes that they can beat us and they've shown it, but we got to learn that it's going to be a physical game."   -- Hawks guard  Willie Green  on losing all three games to the 76ers this season. GOOD MOVE:  The decision to get the ball down low to Brand. The veteran had his way against whoever was guarding him and when he was double-teamed he found the open man for two key 3-pointers in the fourth quarter. BAD MOVE:  A couple defensive lapses by the Hawks allowed Iguodala and  Jrue Holiday  to slip wide open for 3-pointers. ROOKIE WATCH:  Hawks forward  Ivan Johnson  was the only rookie to see action. He scored seven points and grabbed six boards in 16 minutes. NOTABLE:  The Sixers have held opponents under 100 points in 21 of the past 22 games. ... The Hawks are 20-5 when Smith scores 20 or more points. ... If the Sixers finish 5-9 or better, they'll secure their first winning season since 2004-05. ... The Sixers won for just the third time this season by seven or fewer points. They are 3-14 in games decided by that margin. ... The Hawks became the first team to have a 30-point scorer in a loss to the Sixers. Philadelphia is 1-5 when allowing a player to score 30 or more. ... It's the first time the Sixers swept the season series against Atlanta since 2000-01. NEXT:  For the Hawks, Wednesday vs. Charlotte, Friday @ vs. Detroit, Saturday @ Charlotte. For the Sixers, Tuesday at Miami, Wednesday vs. Toronto, Saturday vs. Orlando.
