 THE FACT:   In five games this season against his hometown teams, the New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets, Indiana's  Lance Stephenson  has averaged 20.2 points on 37-for-66 shooting (.561). 
 
 THE LEAD:   Stephenson recently launched a YouTube video campaigning for an All-Star selection. He might want to consider substituting the game film from Thursday night, because his performance made the most compelling argument for the Pacers guard. Stephenson scored a career-high 28 to spark the Pacers to their ninth straight home win, 117-89 over the New York Knicks at Bankers Life Fieldhouse.  Paul George  added 25 for Indiana (31-7), which improved to 20-1 at home.  Carmelo Anthony  led New York (15-24) with 28 points, but just 10 came after his first-quarter eruption. 
 
 QUOTABLE:   "[Stephenson is] getting better and better.  He's efficient making the right basketball plays.  If he's flashy, he's being flashy making basketball plays.  One of our assistants said, 'boy I wish I had Lance's energy every day.'  His competitive spirit is as high as anyone we've coached."  
 -- Indiana coach  Frank Vogel 
 
 
 THE STAT:   After scoring fewer than 100 points in seven consecutive games, the Pacers have produced season-high point totals twice in the last three nights, following up 116 against Sacramento with 117 against the Knicks. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  With Anthony scoring 18 first-quarter points, the Knicks got off to a fast start and lead 36-34 early in the second quarter. But the Pacers put together a quick 11-1 run to push the lead to 45-37 and it steadily grew from there, reaching 63-48 at the half. The Knicks tried to creep back into the game in the fourth quarter, cutting the lead to 91-75 early in the period, but Stephenson sparked a 16-4 burst that blew it wide open. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:   "When I play against my hometown games, I've got to show out because I know my family and friends are watching." 
 -- Indiana's Lance Stephenson 
 
 
 HOT:  Stephenson shot 10-for-17 overall, 3-for-7 from the 3-point line. His teammate  David West  hit 6-for-11 for Indiana.  
 
 NOT:   Aside from Anthony (3-for-3), the Knicks shot 1-for-16 from the 3-point line. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "They're a good team, but I don't think they're 30 points better than our team. We were awful."  
 -- New York coach  Mike Woodson 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  In its nine-game home winning streak, Indiana has outscored opponents by an average of 21.3 points. ... The Pacers had a season-low six turnovers, and set a season high with 63 points in the first half. ... The Knicks lost two forwards to sprained left ankles.  Kenyon Martin  left early in the second quarter and  Amar'e Stoudemire  went down late in the third. Woodson said both players likely would miss "a few" games. ...  J.R. Smith  was back in the Knicks' rotation but  Pablo Prigioni  won't be back until Monday. Smith was benched twice in the previous four games as reports surfaced of a rift with Woodson, but the Knicks coach said after the morning shootaround he needs Smith "every game." Smith scored 12 points in 27:50 off the bench. ... West scored 12,  Roy Hibbert  and  Danny Granger  11 apiece and  Luis Scola  10 for Indiana. ...  Tyson Chandler  scored 13 with  Raymond Felton  adding 12 for the Knicks. ... Out since fracturing a bone in his right foot on Dec. 16, Prigioni told Woodson he needed additional conditioning time before returning to game action, so the coach said he would be back in uniform when the Knicks host the Nets. ... Prigioni and  Metta World Peace  (sore left knee) were New York's inactives, while rookie  Solomon Hill  was a healthy scratch for Indiana. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Pacers, Saturday vs. L.A. Clippers, Monday @ Golden State, Wednesday @ Phoenix. For the Knicks, Friday vs. L.A. Clippers, Monday vs. Brooklyn, Wednesday vs. Philadelphia.
