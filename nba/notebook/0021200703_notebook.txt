 THE FACTS: Damian Lillard  scored 23 points and dished out eight assists as Portland outdueled Utah down the stretch to win 105-99 Saturday night at the Rose Garden and snap a five-game losing streak in its series with the Jazz. 
 
 J.J. Hickson  chipped in 21 points and 11 rebounds,  LaMarcus Aldridge  had 18 points and 11 boards and  Nicolas Batum  came within an assist of a triple-double for Portland (24-23). Batum finished with 12 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists. 
 
 Randy Foye  scored 23 points and  Paul Millsap  collected 18 points, eight rebounds and five assists for the Jazz (26-22). 
 
 THE STAT : On Friday night, Portland shot 36.7 and scored a season-low in an 86-77 loss to Utah at EnergySolutions Arena. A night later, the Trail Blazers shot at a 50.7 clip against the same team. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "Twenty-four hours makes a difference. [Friday] night, we couldn't score against them. Tonight, we did a much better job."  
 -- Portland coach  Terry Stotts 
 
 
 TURNING POINT : Utah extended a three-point halftime lead to 63-53 on three 3-pointers by Foye midway through the third quarter. The Blazers responded with a 14-0 run,  Will Barton' s driving layup giving them a 67-63 edge.  
 
 QUOTABLE II : "We played hard. We made some mistakes. We had the 10-point lead but got away from executing a little bit and they made a run at us. I felt good about our opportunity to come back, but we just couldn't get over the hump." 
 -- Utah coach  Tyrone Corbin 
 
 
 HOT : Portland's  Nolan Smith  entered the game with a 33.3 shooting percentage and a 2.3-point scoring average. The little-used guard, pressed into action by ankle injuries by guards  Wesley Matthews  and  Ronnie Price.  He scored a season-high 13 points on 5-for-7 shooting, including a clutch 3-pointer down the stretch, in 18 minutes off the bench. 
 
 NOT : Second-year center  Enes Kanter  thought they put a lid on the Rose Garden baskets. Utah's second-year center was 0-for-7 from the field despite shooting nothing but layups and short jumpers.  
 
 GOOD MOVE : In the third quarter, Millsap found teammate  Marvin Williams  wide open underneath. As Williams rose up to dunk, Batum came from nowhere to make a spectacular dunk that led to a Blazer basket at the other end. 
 
 BAD MOVE :  DeMarre Carroll  had a great shooting night (5-for-5) off the bench for Utah, but drew a fourth-quarter technical for complaining about a no-call on one of the attempts. 
 
 NOTABLE : Utah had won nine of its previous 11 games. ... Portland won the rebound battle 49-37 after losing it 47-40 the previous night. ... Portland leads the NBA with 11 wins this season after trailing at halftime (11-16 record). ... The Blazers are 8-0 this season when shooting 50 percent or better. ... Hickson notched his 26th double-double of the season. ... Portland made 10 of his 18 3-point attempts while Utah was 8-for-19 from beyond the arc. ... Both teams were shorthanded. Portland was without Matthews, Price (ankle) and reserve forward  Sasha Pavlovic  (foot). Utah was minus starting point guard  Mo Williams  (hand), reserve point guard  Earl Watson  (knee) and reserve forward  Gordon Hayward  (shoulder). 
 
 QUOTABLE III : "That's the best the bench has played all year. All the guys who came in tonight were ready. That was big for us."  
 -- Nicolas Batum 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Jazz, Monday vs. Sacramento, Wednesday vs. Milwaukee, Friday vs. Chicago. For the Trail Blazers, Monday @ Minnesota, Wednesday @ Dallas, Friday @ Houston.
