  Raptors-Wizards notebook    By John Mitchell, for NBA.com Posted Tuesday November 16, 2010 11:20PM THE FACTS:  The Washington Wizards, playing their first game without rookie sensation  John Wall  in the starting lineup and with  Gilbert Arenas  making his first appearance in the starting lineup, dispatched the visiting Toronto Raptors 109-94. Wall missed the game with a sprained left foot. With him out of the game, Washington (3-6) got strong contributions from  Andray Blatche  (22 points, seven rebounds, five assists), Arenas (20 points) and  Nick Young  (20 points, six rebounds). The Wizards broke the game open in the third quarter when they outscored the Raptors (2-9) 36-21. QUOTABLE:  "Just from seeing him play the last game I could tell that he was getting his confidence back. I was hoping and praying that he would come out and do the same thing. It's great to have him back and play at a high level."    - Blatche on getting Arenas back in the starting lineup  THE STAT:  The Wizards have been doing a great job of sharing the ball lately.  Kirk Hinrich  had a season-high 12 assists and the Wizards had 28 for the game. TURNING POINT : After Toronto's  Reggie Evans  hit a putback layup with 9:34 left to trim Washington's lead to eight, the Wizards went on a 13-3 run to help salt away the win.
