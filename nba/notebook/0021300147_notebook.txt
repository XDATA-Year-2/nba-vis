 THE FACT: Rudy Gay  has now made six game-winning or tying shots in the final 10 seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime in his last four seasons, passing  Carmelo Anthony  (5) for league-most. 
 The Portland Trail Blazers (8-2) continued their solid start to the season, winning their sixth game in a row, defeating the Toronto Raptors (4-7), 118-110 at the Air Canada Centre in overtime on Sunday. The Blazers had a balanced attack with three starters scoring 24 points or more with  Damian Lillard  and  LaMarcus Aldridge  scoring 25 and  Nicolas Batum  adding a season-high 24 points. 
 After a closely contested first half where Toronto shot 56.8 per cent from the floor and the Blazers shot 46.7 percent from the 3-point line, the visitors were up 57-54 going into the break. With 5:41 left In the third quarter, Aldridge and Batum scored all but one point of an 11-4 Portland run to force the first double-digit lead of the game, closing the quarter at 79-69. However, the Raptors made a final surge, with 2:24 left in the fourth, going on a 13-2 run, capped off by a Gay buzzer-beating lay-up to send the game into overtime.  
 Despite the Raptors momentum leading into the final frame, the Trail Blazers outscored 16-8, with Lillard and Batum combining for 13 of those points with three, 3-point shots. The Raptors were led by Gay's game-high 30-point and 10-rebound double-double and  DeMar DeRozan's  29 points. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "That's not the first time we doing it, I think four or five times in a row, we had a good lead and we have to close out the game and the other team came back. But we did a good job in overtime." --  Blazers forward Batum on the Blazers surrendering a double-digit lead. 
 
 
 THE STAT : The Blazers were effective with their ability to spread the floor on offense. That spacing led to 32 attempts from behind the arc where they knocked down a season-high 15 shots for a 46.9 percentage, almost making more 3-point shots than the Raptors attempted (17). 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Raptors 19-6 run of the final 4:02 of the fourth quarter to force overtime appeared to be the game changer, but with 2:30 left in the extra frame the Blazers went on a 14-2 run to close out and win the ball game. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "That's been one of our strengths. I thought in the first half we moved the ball really well, but I think we're playing pretty unselfishly to find the open man. We have enough good shooters that if you give them time they're going to make more than their share of shots." --  Blazers head coach  Terry Stotts  on ball movement. 
 
 
 HOT : Batum was 8-for-15 for 24 points, with six rebounds, four assists and two blocked shots, but was key from the 3-point line, shooting 5-for-8, particularly in overtime where he went 2-for-2 with big baskets that put the game out of reach. 
 
 NOT : The Blazers interior defense gave up 62 Raptors points in the paint. They have had difficulty protecting the painted area all season, giving up a poor 48.2 points per game prior to Sunday, yet it hasn't affected their ability to win games. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Portland has won nine of its last 10 games versus the Raptors. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Raptors; Wednesday @ 76ers, Friday vs. Bullets, and Tuesday vs. Nets. For the Trail Blazers; Monday @ Nets, Wednesday @ Bucks and Friday vs. Bulls
