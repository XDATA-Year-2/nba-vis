 THE FACT:  Atlanta Hawk  Al Horford  hits a jumper to cap electrifying comeback from 17 down to get past the Dallas Mavericks. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Horford hit a 19-foot jumper from the top of the key with 4.2 seconds remaining as the Atlanta Hawks (9-8) stunned the Dallas Mavericks (10-7) in Atlanta 88-87 Friday night.  Jeff Teague  scored a game-high 25 points, 15 of them in the fourth quarter when Atlanta outscored Dallas 24-12. Horford added 17 with 12 rebounds for the Hawks, who snapped a three-game losing streak and a two-game home skid.  
 Forward  Paul Millsap  set up Horford's heroics, hitting his first 3 of the game and only his seventh of the year, with 1:16 left, to pull Atlanta to within one possession for the first time since the last minute of the first quarter. Dallas had one final chance, but  Vince Carter 's 20-footer rimmed out at the buzzer.  
 
 Dirk Nowitzki  and  Jose Calderon  each had 16 points to lead the Mavs, but Calderon was slowed by a first-quarter ankle injury, left the game in the third quarter and didn't play in the fourth.  DeJuan Blair  pulled down a game-high 18 rebounds. Dallas led by as much as 17 in the third quarter and held a 70-53 edge with 4:05 left in the frame, but went only 3-for-19 in the fourth quarter. 
 
 THE STAT:  Atlanta held a 46-16 advantage on points in the paint, shot 54.8 percent (23-for-42) in the lane and dominated on the break, holding a 23-2 edge. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  With 3:34 remaining in the third quarter, Calderon left the game for good, unable to play on his injured right ankle. At the time, Dallas had a 70-57 lead and had only nine turnovers in the first 32:30. Over the final 15:30 the Mavericks were outscored 31-17 and committed nine turnovers. It turns out Calderon injured his right ankle late in the first quarter but played through as long as he could. 
 
 HOT:  Teague took advantage first of Calderon, then of anyone Dallas put at the point, in scoring his 25 points. Teague used his speed to get to the basket, scoring three of his four first-quarter baskets on drives in the paint. Then, in the second half, while he shot only 3-for-6, he got to the line 11 times, making nine of his attempts. 
 
 NOT:  While their last 3-pointer, Millsap's with 1:16 remaining, left a nice impression, the Hawks really missed  Kyle Korver  and his three-point shooting. Atlanta made only 3 of their 15 attempts from long range (20 percent), and was outscored from behind the arc, 27-9. ... Neither team got much from its Bench. Hawks and Mavs reserves combined for 30 points (Dallas, 20, Atlanta, 10), on a combined 23.1 percent shooting (9-for-39). Dallas got 20 points from its bench, on 5-for-22 from the field, 1-for-8 from 3, while Atlanta's reserves totaled 10 points on 4-for-17, 1-for-6 from long range.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It impacted, but that's why we are called professionals. We have to have guys waiting to come in and step up and play minutes when we need them. It's a sport. Guys go down with injuries every day. So the next person has to be in line, ready to come in, step up and play."

 QUOTABLE II:  "That wasn't how we planned it. It was guts by Paul. Then on my play, Jeff was double-teamed so he kicked it to me. We've worked so much on that pick-and-pop over the years. I feel comfortable taking that shot."  
 
 -- Atlanta center Al Horford on the Hawks' final two possessions 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  In two games against Atlanta, Dallas has made 20 treys, and shot .416 (20-for-48)...The Mavs, who came into Friday's game averaging 8.9 per game, stayed on their average, hitting that their ninth with 10:39 remaining in the fourth quarter...Horford got a scare 17 seconds into the fourth quarter, as he got hit in the mouth by the back of head of Dallas' Blair. ...The Hawks recorded 10 steals for the sixth time this season...The 15.8 fourth-quarter shooting by Dallas was the lowest for a Hawks' opponent in any quarter this season 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Hawks, Saturday @ Washington, Monday at San Antonio, Wednesday vs. Los Angeles Clippers. For the Mavericks, Saturday vs. Minnesota, Tuesday vs. Charlotte, Wednesday @ New Orleans.
