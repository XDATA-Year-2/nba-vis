  Heat-Knicks notebook   By Shandel Richardson, for NBA.com Posted Tuesday December 28, 2010 10:48PM THE FACTS:  Miami's Big Three of  Dwyane Wade  (40 points, nine rebounds),  LeBron James  (18 points, 10 rebounds, eight assists), and  Chris Bosh  (18 points, 10 rebounds) led the way and delivered a 106-98 Heat victory, their 15th win in 16 games. Miami never gave up the lead after going ahead, 4-2. New York made a couple of notable runs, getting within 61-55, 88-80, and 97-94, but the Knicks could never close the deal. QUOTABLE:  "They kept on coming."  --  Heat coach  Erik Spoelstra  on New York making comebacks to get with 61-55, 88-80 and 97-94. THE STAT:  Miami, which doesn't have a strong low-post presence, ended with a season-best 56 points in the paint. The Heat got those points on fastbreaks and in transition offense. In both cases Miami used its 50-32 rebounding edge to get easy buckets in the paint. TURNING POINT:  Tough to say for sure but it was fairly early. Miami took a 34-15 lead late in the first quarter and at one point had a 14-2 rebounding edge. New York closed to 37-27 in the second quarter but Miami went on a 12-0 run. Miami also went on a 12-4 run when New York got within 61-55 in the third quarter. QUOTABLE II:  "Hopefully we can turn things around by having some more energy and execute a little better."    -- New York coach  Mike D'Antoni  on what the Knicks could do differently from the first time these teams met in a 113-91 Miami victory. HOT:  Knicks forward  Amar'e Stoudemire  (30 points) had his 16th consecutive game of at least 20 points and is averaging 26.2 points per game, second in the NBA. NOT:  Knicks forward  Danilo Gallinari  is 6-for-24 (.250) on three-pointers in his last four games. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Center  Zydrunas Ilgauskas  had 12 points and nine rebounds in the first quarter. He didn't play in the second quarter for some reason, but, hey, when you almost have a double-double in the first quarter you deserve a break. The 7-foot-3 Ilgauskas ended with 14 points and 10 rebounds in just 14 minutes because the Knicks play small lineups. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Knicks fan extraordinaire  Spike Lee , the highly-acclaimed director, was sitting courtside in his Knicks apparel. He chatted up James a couple of times, chatted up Heat guard  Mario Chalmers  and waved a "hello" to actress  Gabrielle Union , Wade's girlfriend. ROOKIE WATCH:  Knicks forward  Landry Fields  had a rough night, finishing with just two points on 1-for-6 shooting. He went to the line with the Knicks trailing, 100-94, and hit 1-of-3. He grabbed six rebounds, but clearly didn't have one of his better games. GOOD MOVE:  Miami wasn't shooting three-pointers well (it was 2-for-7 in the first half and 2-for-10 at one point in the third period) so it stopped shooting them. Nice recognition. BAD MOVE:  The refs were handing out technical fouls like they were going out of style. There were six in total. Both coaches got one, and so did Wade, Stoudemire,  Shawne Williams  (from the bench) and Ilgauskas. Maybe half were deserved. UP NEXT:  For Miami at Houston (Wednesday), against Golden State (Saturday), at Charlotte (Monday), against Milwaukee (Jan. 4), at Milwaukee (Jan. 7). For New York at Orlando (Thursday), against Indiana (Sunday), against San Antonio (Jan. 4), at Phoenix (Jan. 7), at Lakers (Jan. 9).
