 THE FACTS: Tony Parker  and the San Antonio Spurs hammered the Dallas Mavericks for the second straight Sunday, stretching their winning streak to five with a 111-86 victory at the American Airlines Center. Parker scored 21 points,  Manu Ginobili  added 20 and  Tim Duncan  tallied 18 points and 10 rebounds as the Spurs (24-8) led wire-to-wire against the miserable Mavericks (12-19), who have lost six straight and nine of 10. 
 Three-point shooting was a decisive factor again. Last Sunday, the Spurs set a franchise record with 20 3-point field goals in a lopsided 129-91 defeat of Dallas at the AT&T Center. San Antonio was a more modest 8-for-19 this time, but the Mavericks were just 1-for-16 from behind the arc (6.3 percent). 
 
 Darren Collison  had 18 points and eight assists and  Elton Brand  contributed 14 points and 10 boards off the bench for the Mavericks.  Dirk Nowitzki  had eight points, five rebounds, three blocked shots and two assists and played 22:30 in his fourth game back from knee surgery. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We were fortunate. Obviously Dirk is not ready. He's not Dirk Nowitzki, basically one of the greatest players that's ever played, so it's going to take time for him. Everybody's just trying to figure out their place and work around and get back into a rotation. It's very, very difficult when you have a guy like that out and then he comes back.." --  Spurs head coach  Gregg Popovich . 
 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The last time the Mavericks were seven games under .500 was on April 6, 2000 (34-41). That was the first season  Mark Cuban  owned the team. 
 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Every time the Mavericks pulled within single digits, the Spurs had an answer. Ginobili finally took the wind out of Dallas for good when his 28-foot heave just beat the shot clock and put San Antonio up 80-70 with 31.9 seconds left in the third quarter. 
 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We've got to stick together and we've got to fight -- and we've got to fight harder than we did tonight." --  Mavericks head coach  Rick Carlisle. 
 
 
 
 HOT:  Parker was 10-for-17 from the field with a game-high nine assists and five rebounds. 
 
 
 NOT: Shawn Marion, Rodrigue Beaubois  and  Chris Douglas-Roberts  shot a combined 2-for-15 for the Mavericks. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  It was Brand's third double-double of the season and 399th of his career, his first since a Dec. 1 win against the Pistons. He was 7-for-11 from the floor. Brand had scored a combined eight points in his previous three games. 
 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The Mavericks had a moment of silence before the game for the late  Horace Ardinger , one of the original owners/investors of the franchise. ... Members of the Oklahoma and Texas A&M football teams, in town for the Cotton Bowl, attended the game. 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Mavericks used their 14th different starting lineup in 31 games, with Vince Carter getting his first start of the season (948th of his career). ... This was the Mavs' eighth loss by 20 or more points this season. They had four in 2011-12. ... San Antonio improved to 18-3 when scoring 100-plus points, 17-1 when leading at halftime and 13-0 when shooting 50 percent or better from the field (50.6). ... The Spurs are 13-1 when two or more players score at least 20 points. ... San Antonio snapped a four-game road losing streak. ... Dallas outscored San Antonio 19-2 in second-chance points. 
 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Tuesday @ Washington, Wednesday @ Miami, Saturday vs. New Orleans. For the Spurs, Monday vs. Brooklyn, Wednesday @ Milwaukee, Thursday @ New York.
