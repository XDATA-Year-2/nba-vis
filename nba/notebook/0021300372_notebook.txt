 THE FACT:   Kyle Korver  tied his career high with eight 3-pointers while scoring a season-high 28 points. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Largely behind Korver, the Hawks tied their season high with 15 treys to rout the visiting Kings 124-107, as one of the NBA's worst defenses gave up 58 percent shooting. Sacramento had a shot at just its third road win of the season. But after entering the fourth quarter with a two-point lead, a defense that had barely met the definition of that word showed up -- or disappeared -- in earnest. Atlanta shot 60 percent (14-for-20) in the final period, and 5-for-8 on 3-pointers.   
 Center  Al Horford  remained hot with 25 points and 10 rebounds, five assists and four blocked shots, and scored 12 points in the fourth quarter on 6-for-6 shooting. Korver scored 11 in the period with 3-for-4 shooting from beyond the arc.  
 The Hawks also had a season-high 38 assists in a game where point guard J eff Teague  tied his career high with 15 assists while scoring 18 points.  
 Sacramento led 87-85 entering the fourth, and  DeMarcus Cousins  would go on to score 28 for the visitors while  Rudy Gay  went past 20 for the third time in four games since being traded from the Raptors (22). 
 The final period, however, was remarkable for the ease with which the Hawks scored. 
 
 Mike Scott  made a trey for the Hawks to open the period and give the home team a lead, and after the Kings took it back a couple times, Atlanta went up for good (93-91) on another long ball by Scott with 10:06 left.  
 Every Atlanta starter scored at least 14 points, and Sacramento point guard  Isaiah Thomas  scored just two of his 20 points in the fourth quarter after frustrating the Hawks repeatedly through the first three periods.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "About everything was working in the second half ... everyone was dangerous. I got a lot of really good looks tonight. I don't usually get that many. That was a product of a lot of our spacing, and just everyone knocking down shots." 
 -- Kyle Korver, who scored 17 points in the second half.  
 
 
 THE STAT:  38 -- The Hawks' 38 assists were a Philips Arena record. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Hawks scored on their first five possessions, and seven of the first eight -- including two 3-pointers each by Scott and Korver. Atlanta had a 12-4 rebounding edge in the period.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I don't know where to begin. I guess I'm not doing a good enough job to give our players a game plan that they can execute, and I'm not doing a good enough job explaining who the players are on their team who can make shots. We're one of the worst defensive teams in the NBA, and we come on the road and give up 39 points in the fourth quarter and let them shoot 58 percent." -- Kings coach  Michael Malone 
 
 
 HOT:  Korver, who stretched his NBA record to 95 consecutive games with at least one 3-point shot made, hit 19-of- 35 (54.3 percent) over the past four games. ... Over the last four games, Horford averaged 23.8 points, 10.5 rebounds, shot 63.2 percent (43-for-68) and made 80 percent of his free throws (8-for-10). ... With 106 points in a loss to the Knicks, 114 in a win over the Lakers and 124 Wednesday, Atlanta has averaged 114.7 points in the past three games -- against attrocious defensive teams. ... Cousins (28 points) has scored 20 or more in 10 of his last 12 games. ... Thomas is averaging 22.3 points over the past six games. ... The Hawks shot 55.2 percent over the past three games (132-for-239) and 48.8 percent on treys (41-for-84).   
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "We broke down completely defensively tonight. I think Kyle Korver shot 8-for-10 from the land of three, and he's known as a shooter but we didn't defend him." 
 -- Cousins 
 
 
 NOT:  After missing all four of his shots, Sacramentos Travis Outlaw is 10-for-37 (27 percent) over the past six games.  
 I N THE ARENA:  NBA/Turner TV megastar  Shaquille O'Neal  was at Philips Arena, although the big fella had to change seats several times as he kept taking up those paid for by patrons. O'Neal is a minority owner of the Kings. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Kings guard  Marcus Thorton , who has been the subject of trade rumors, picked up his second straight DNP-CD after playing in 18 of Sacramento's first 22 games, and starting six. ... Sacramento rookie  Ben McLemore  broke a 6-for-35 slump over five games with 10 points on 5-for-6 shooting. He added five rebounds. ... Korver's eight made 3-pointers not only tied his career high, but tied the Philips Arena mark -- which he set last season.  
 
 UP NEXT : For the Kings, Friday @ Miami, Saturday @ Orlando, Monday vs. New Orleans. For the Hawks, Friday vs. Utah, Monday @ Miami, Thursday @ Cleveland.
