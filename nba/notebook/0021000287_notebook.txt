  Kings-Lakers notebook   By Bryan Chu, for NBA.com Posted Saturday December 4, 2010 1:55AM THE FACTS:  The streak has ended. After dropping four straight, the Lakers rebounded at home, taking out the Kings with ease, 113-80, Friday at the Staples Center. This game was exactly what the Lakers (14-6) needed as the Kings (4-13) came into the game struggling mightily as well. With the loss, their eight straight to the Lakers, the Kings have now dropped 12 of their last 13 games. Six Lakers scored in double figures.  Kobe Bryant  had a game-high 22 points.  Lamar Odom  and  Pau Gasol  tallied 16 apiece. Sacramento had three players in double figures with  Jason Thompson  scoring a team-high 19 points.  Tyreke Evans  added 15 points and  Pooh Jeter  chipped in with 11. The contest got out of hand early. The Lakers used a 20-6 run midway in the second quarter to lead by as many as 18 points in the first half. They were up 52-35 at the break. Los Angeles' biggest lead in the game was 35 points. QUOTABLE:  "It wasn't a good time for us to catch the world champs at home. They took it to us. The biggest problem is we turned the ball over too many times and then as the turnovers continued and the poor shooting continued, the avalanche started. We couldn't do anything about it...there was no coming back for us tonight."   -- Kings coach  Paul Westphal   THE STAT:  33: The Lakers' margin of victory, which was a season high. Their previous was a 28-point advantage against the Warriors on Nov. 21. TURNING POINT:  The Lakers used an early 11-0 run in the first quarter. Then to start the third quarter, they buried the Kings by making nine of their first 11 shots to go up 72-42 with 5:02 left in the third period. HOT:  In 26 minutes of action, Bryant scored a game-high 22 points on 9-for-18 shooting. NOT:  Second-year swingman Evans scored 15 points, but it took him 15 attempts.
