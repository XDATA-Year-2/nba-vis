 THE FACTS:  The Nets routed the Kings at Barclays Center, 113-93, with help from six players scoring between 14 and 18 points. After a fast start -- neither team playing much defense on the second night of back-to-backs -- the Nets outscored the Kings by 13 in the second quarter and left little doubt the rest of the way.  Brook Lopez  scored 18 points in under 17 minutes, while  DeMarcus Cousins  (28 points, 11 rebounds) continued to put up gaudy numbers for the Kings.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It was great, our starters came out focused. Our bench came in and took our energy to a whole other level." - Lopez 
 
 THE STAT:  The Nets shot 67.5 percent in the first half en route to 65 points.   
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Nets took control with an 11-0 run in the second quarter, sparked by seven points from  Mirza Teletovic. 
 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I just feel like the energy wasn't there from the beginning. It hurt us once again."  --  Cousins .   
 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  Barclays Center was sold out for the 12th time in 19 home games.  
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Teletovic finished with a career-high 14 points, six rebounds and two blocks...  Thomas Robinson  didn't contribute much in 16-plus minutes, save a few spectacular dunks with the outcome already decided.  
 
 NOTABLE:  Teletovic shot his first free throws of the season in the second quarter. ...  Travis Outlaw , signed by the Nets in the summer of 2010, went scoreless in his Brooklyn debut, misfiring on all five of his field goal attempts. ... The Nets had 50 bench points, led by  Andray Blatche  (15),  MarShon Brooks  (15) and Teletovic. ...  P.J. Carlesimo  is now 5-1 as the Nets' interim coach.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Kings, Monday vs. Memphis, Thursday vs. Dallas, Saturday vs. Miami. For the Nets, Tuesday @ Philadelphia, Friday vs. Phoenix, Sunday vs. Indiana.
