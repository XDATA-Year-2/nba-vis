 THE FACTS :  Goran Dragic  spun around  Marc Gasol  and sank a running left-handed hook shot with 0.5 seconds left and the Phoenix Suns beat the Memphis Grizzlies 82-80 Wednesday night to snap a seven-game losing streak. 
 
 Rudy Gay  tied the game for Memphis on a 16-foot turnaround jumper over  P.J. Tucker  with 46.8 seconds left. But Gay's attempt to give the Grizzlies their first lead since the 7:07 mark of the fourth quarter went off the rim and was pulled down by  Markieff Morris  to set up Dragic's game-winning basket. 
 
 Shannon Brown  and  Jared Dudley  had 15 points apiece, Dragic had 12 and Morris finished with 11 for the Suns (8-15), who won for the first time since Nov. 27 at Cleveland. 
 Gay scored 21 and pulled down 11 rebounds,  Zach Randolph  had 18 points and 10 rebounds and Gasol finished with 15 for the Grizzlies (14-5), who have lost consecutive games for the first time this season. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "That play was improv for me. I [played] pick and roll and [took] that last shot."  
 -- Goran Dragic 
 
 THE STAT : The Grizzlies outscored the Suns 60-38 in the paint in their 108-98 overtime win on Dec. 4. Despite Randolph's best efforts, Phoenix flipped the script tonight, outscoring Memphis 42-38 in the paint and pulled down 19 offensive rebounds to the Grizzlies' 10. 
 
 TURNING POINT : Through the game's first 20 minutes, the Suns were 12-for-39 from the floor --30.8 percent. Phoenix was 22-for-50 the rest of the way, a more respectable 44 percent.  
 
 QUOTABLE II : "The refs were letting us play out there. They weren't calling fouls on us, so we started hacking them. It was a big hack fest out there."  
 -- Jared Dudley 
 
 HOT : Dudley notched season highs in rebounds (9) and assists (5) and matched a season high with three steals. He finished 7-for-14 from the floor and has shot better than 50 percent from the field in four of his past five games. 
 
 NOT : Luis Scola returned to the Suns' starting lineup for the first time in 11 games, but scored only four points on 1-for-6 shooting in 13 minutes. Fellow Phoenix forward  Michael Beasley  was 2-for-11, also with for four points, in 10 minutes. Subtract those two shooting lines and the rest of the Suns shot 31-for-72 -- 43.1 percent. 
 
 NOTABLE : The Suns held on despite not scoring from the 4:05 mark of the fourth quarter until Dragic's basket. 
 
 IN THE ARENA : WWE wrestler Dolph Ziggler and ring announcer Justin Roberts were courtside. ... Attendance was 13,093, more than 5,000 below capacity at US Airways Center. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Grizzlies, Friday @ Nuggets, Saturday @ Jazz, Monday vs. Bulls. For the Suns, Friday vs. Jazz, Monday vs. Kings, Wednesday vs. Bobcats.
