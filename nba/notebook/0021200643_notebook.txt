 THE FACTS : The Philadelphia 76ers opened a season-high, eight-game homestand with a resounding 97-80 victory over the New York Knicks Saturday night at the Wells Fargo Center.  Jrue Holiday , who was recently named to his first NBA All-Star Game, scored a career-high 35 points while  Evan Turner  and  Nick Young  contributed 20 points each.  Thaddeus Young  had 10 for the Sixers, who improved to 18-25. 
 
 Carmelo Anthony  led the Knicks with 25 points but needed 28 shots to accomplish the feat.  Amar'e Stoudemire  scored 20 points and  Tyson Chandler  swept 10 rebounds. The Knicks fell to 26-15, and 12-9 on the road. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "I think we did better defensively. We still have a ways to go." 
 -- Sixers center  Spencer Hawes 
 
 
 THE STAT : The Knicks struggled all night long from 3-point land, going 4-for-27. 
 
 TURNING POINT : The Sixers led by 26 after three quarters. After the Knicks got within 18 early in the fourth, Philadelphia responded with another spurt and pushed the advantage back to 26. 
 
 HOT : Holiday knocked down 16 of his 25 shots while Turner was 8-for-14. 
 
 NOT:  Anthony was 9-for-28 while  J.R. Smith  (0-for-8),  Iman Shumpert  (0-for-6) and  Jason Kidd  (0-for-3) combined to shoot 0-for-17. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "We didn't come to compete tonight and that was disappointing." 
 -- Knicks coach  Mike Woodson 
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT : In addition to Holiday's career-high 35 points, he also had six assists, five rebounds and one steal. Young had 20 points in a start for the Sixers, adding four rebounds, four assists and one steal. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA : The sellout crowd of 20,540 was buzzing throughout for this rivalry matchup. It was loud from start to finish. Phillies shortstop Jimmy Rollins attended the game and received a warm ovation. 
 
 QUOTABLE III : "I know it gives me a lot of energy, especially when we start off hitting like we did." 
 -- Jrue Holiday on the team's fast start against the Knicks 
 
 GOOD MOVE : Turner continues to handle a bulk of the ball-handling duties for long stretches of minutes. It gives Holiday a chance to rest and freelance around the perimeter and it paid huge dividends on this night. 
 
 BAD MOVE : The Knicks could have gone to Stoudemire more often. Especially on a night when Anthony's shot was off. Stoudemire was having quite a bit of success in the low post, but the Knicks kept shooting jumpers. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH : Knicks guard  Pablo Prigioni  had six points, four rebounds and two assists, while forward  Chris Copeland  scored six points and added two rebounds. For the Sixers, forward  Arnett Moultrie  was scoreless with one rebound in 4:05. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Sixers coach  Doug Collins  left the court in the third quarter and was treated for a blocked nasal passage and sinus infection. All tests came back negative and he's listed as day-to-day. ... Knicks point guard  Raymond Felton  returned to the starting lineup after missing the past 12 games with a fractured right fifth finger. ... The Sixers played without guard  Jason Richardson  for the third straight game because of left knee synovitis. ... Hawes started his first game of the season. ...The Sixers won despite being outrebounded 47-34. They are now 1-7 this season when being outrebounded by 10 or more. ... The Knicks' 80 points were their second-lowest total of the season -- 76 at Indiana on Jan. 10. They have scored below 90 in each of the past three games. ... The Sixers are 6-0 when shooting 50 percent or better and 9-0 when holding the opposition to below 40 percent shooting. ... Kidd didn't register an assist in 14:57. ... The Knicks missed 12 consecutive field goals from 11:21 to 3:59 of the third quarter. ... Collins and  Royal Ivey  each received a technical foul. So did Chandler. ... Holiday's 35 points is the most by a Sixer since  Willie Green  had 37 on April 18, 2007 at Toronto. Over the past six games, Holiday is averaging 25.2 points on 50.4 percent shooting.
