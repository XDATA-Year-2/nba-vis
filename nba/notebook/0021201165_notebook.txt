 THE FACTS:   The Miami Heat played without  LeBron James ,  Dwyane Wade  and  Chris Bosh , attempted a franchise record 41 3-pointers, committed 25 turnovers, and still defeated the Washington Wizards 103-98 on Wednesday night. The victory clinched home-court advantage throughout the playoffs. 
 
 Ray Allen  matched his season high with 23 points, Rashard had 17 points and  Shane Battier  tallied 15 points on five 3-pointers for the Heat (62-16). Miami has won four straight and six of seven. 
 
 John Wall  had 17 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds for the Wizards (29-50), who have lost three straight and had their nine-game home-court winning streak snapped. 
 The Heat played their first game this season without James (sore right hamstring), Wade (sore right knee) or Bosh (flu) in the lineup. James played 30 minutes against Milwaukee on Tuesday night and sported a thick wrap on his right thigh after Wednesday's win. 
 
 Udonis Haslem , who has been dealing with an ankle injury, also sat out the victory that ensured every playoff series the team participates in will begin in Miami. 
 Allen and Lewis combined for 19 points in the fourth quarter. Leading 87-86 with 4:59 remaining, Allen scored six straight points including his first 3-pointer of the game. Chris Andersen's two free throws capped the 11-2 run for a 98-88 with 2:52 left.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Want to make sure he feels right. He was a little bit tight yesterday after the game. That was probably to be expected. It was the same amount of tightness he had after Saturday night's game, but we had two days off in between, so he was able to manage that. That was not the case (Wednesday) with the quick turnaround, so hopefully we can continue to get him stronger each day." - - Heat coach  Erik Spoelstra  on sitting out the nine-time All-Star. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Heat made more 3-point field goals (17) than 2-point field goals (16). Four of their starters - Lewis, Battier, Mike Miller and Mario Chalmers - made at least three shots from beyond the arc, sinking a combined 15 for 29. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:   " If was up to me we would have shot more." 
 
 -- Miller who made four 3-pointers and scored 14 points. 
 
 
 HOT:  Price matched Battier with five 3-pointers on eight attempts and finished 8 of 12 from the field 
 
 NOT:  The Wizards 3-point field goal defense needs a tune-up. Including Tuesday's loss at New York, Washington has allowed 37 made shots from beyond the arc. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:   "Honestly we should have blown that team out. To tell you the truth, we just couldn't get it going. You have to be able to take care of those games." 
 -- Forward  Martell Webster  on the Wizards losing to the undermanned Heat. 
 
 
 NOTABLE:   Webster left the game in the third quarter with sore abdominals and did not return. ...Nene had 13 points for the Wizards, but only three rebounds. Miami outrebounded Washington 47-34...Chalmers had 13 points with three 3-pointers. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Heat, Friday vs. Celtics, Sunday vs. Bulls, Monday at Cavs... For the Wizards, Friday vs. 76ers, Monday at Nets, Wednesday at Bulls.
