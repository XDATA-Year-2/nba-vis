  Notebook: Suns 125, Lakers 105 Posted Sunday April 8, 2012 1:21AM By Mike Tulumello, for NBA.com THE FACTS:   Kobe Bryant  sat out Saturday night. Instead,  Michael Redd  did his best Kobe impression. The Phoenix Suns' graybeard, the latest reclamation project of the Suns' medical and training staff, poured in 17 points in the second quarter to turn around a Suns' deficit into a lead, propelling them to a 125-105 win. The win puts the Suns (29-27) one game behind No. 8 Denver in the Western Conference. They are 17-8 since a big win over the Lakers at home on Feb. 19. The Lakers dropped to 35-22. Bryant missed the game with what Lakers trainer  Gary Vitti  called tenosynovitis, or inflamed tendons, of the left shin. "He's been playing with this, and it's not getting any better," he said. The trainer gave no timetable for Bryant's return. Pau Gasol  scored a season-high 30 points for the Lakers plus 13 boards.  Metta World Peace  hit 8-for-10 for 19 points.  Andrew Bynum , had 23 points and 18 rebounds but shot just 10-for-27. The Suns got 24 points from ex-Laker  Shannon Brown , including 20 in the third quarter. He hit a pair of 3-pointers in a 1:01 span to give the Suns a 74-63 lead. The Lakers never got closer than six. Redd, a one-time Olympian and All Star, signed early in the season in hopes of resurrecting his career in the same way  Grant Hill  and  Shaquille O'Neal  did before him with the help of the Suns' acclaimed medical and training staff. He is coming back from a series of devastating knee injuries. Redd, 32, finished with 23 points in 26 minutes. "His body is feeling better," said  Steve Nash , who had 13 points, 11 assists and just one turnover. "I'm excited for him." Redd, part of a Suns' bench that outscored the Lakers' reserves 58-10 said, "We don't come in with any predetermined plan. We just come in and play." QUOTABLE:  "I haven't turned the corner. I've just taken advantage of the opportunity."    -- Michael Redd. THE STAT:  The Suns turned the ball over just three times. That's the lowest total in the 44-season history of the franchise. "We did a great job of playing up tempo, but not overdoing it, and taking good shots."    -- Suns coach  Alvin Gentry . TURNING POINT:  When Redd fired in shots from all over the floor. The Suns trailed 34-25 early in the second quarter, then -- moments later -- Redd got a steal and layup, hit a pair of 3-pointers and a couple of free throws, got another steal and layup as the Suns took a 45-44 lead. He hit two mid-range jumpers as the Suns moved to a 62-57 halftime lead. QUOTABLE II:  "Our medical staff can make anybody healthy enough to play."    -- Alvin Gentry. HOT:  The Suns hit 14-for-29 on 3-pointers. The 14 makes represent a season high. Their 125 points also was a season best. NOT:  The Lakers were 1-for-9 on 3-pointers. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  In the past four games, Redd has averaged 18.3 points. Also, Brown has scored in double figures in a career-high eight straight. In the seven games he's replaced Grant Hill as a starter, he's averaged 17.3 points. INSIDE THE ARENA:  The near-sellout crowd of 18,237 was the season's largest. Front-row fans included  Michael Oher , the football player who inspired the book and movie "The Blind Side." ROOKIE WATCH:  The Suns'  Markieff Morris  had one of his best games. In 26 minutes, he shot 4-for-5 for 13 points. He added five rebounds, two blocks and had just one turnover. NOTABLE:  The Suns now are 5-5 without Hill, who could return for the final week of the season. They have won four of their last five without him. UP NEXT:  For the Lakers, Monday @ New Orleans, Wednesday @ San Antonio and Friday @ Denver. For the Suns, Monday @ Minnesota, Wednesday @ Memphis and Friday @ Houston.
