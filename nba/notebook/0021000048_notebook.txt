
 Sixers-Wizards notebook   By John Mitchell, for NBA.com Posted Tuesday November 2, 2010 11:43PM THE FACTS:  In the first meeting between the two top picks in the 2010 draft,  John Wall  and his Washington Wizards got the best of  Evan Turner  and the visiting Philadelphia 76ers in the Wizards 116-115 overtime victory at Verizon Center. Wall led the way in spectacular fashion, finishing with 29 points, a game-high 13 assists and a franchise-record tying nine steals.  Lou Williams  led the Sixers with 30 points off the bench. Turner scored nine points in reserve. QUOTABLE:  "Oh, he's a fantastic player, a special talent. He's so big, fast and strong. He's going to be very special for Washington."  -- Sixers coach  Doug Collins  on the play of Wall THE STAT:  The Sixers shot 55 percent from the field and still lost the game. Collins said this is because the team has "bad habits that are hard to break." TURNING POINT:  Trailing 106-103 with 3.1 seconds to play, Washington's  Cartier Martin  checked into the game and proceeded to hit a 26-footer with 0.1 seconds to play that sent the crowd into convulsions and the game into overtime. QUOTABLE II:  "There were some big shots but that one was the biggest of the game." -- Wizards forward  Andray Blatche  on Martin's 3-point shot   GOOD MOVE:  Wall picked up his defensive intensity in the second half, recording eight of his franchise-record tying nine steals. NOTABLE:  Lost in the big numbers put up by Wall were the 13 assists and 14 points from Philly's second-year guard  Jrue Holiday . UP NEXT:  For the Sixers, Wednesday vs. Indiana, Friday vs. Cleveland, Sunday vs. New York. For the Wizards, Friday at New York, Saturday vs. Cleveland, Wednesday vs. Houston.
