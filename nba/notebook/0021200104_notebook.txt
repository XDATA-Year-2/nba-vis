 THE FACTS:   Carmelo Anthony  scored 25 points,  J.R. Smith  came off the bench for 21 and the New York Knicks pulled away in the fourth quarter for a 99-89 victory over the Orlando Magic. 
 The Knicks held the Magic to 13 points in the final period to run their record to 5-0 for only the third time in the franchise's 66 seasons. 
 
 J.J. Redick  led Orlando with 18 points, but after taking a one-point lead into the fourth quarter, the Magic shot 5-for-16 with seven turnovers  in losing their fifth straight. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We buckled down on our defense and slowed them down. We kept them off the glass, and once we had a chance to rebound the basketball, we got out."
 --  Carmelo Anthony . 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Knicks' 20-9 advantage in turnovers is consistent with what they have done during their fast start. Through five games the Knicks have committed 54 turnovers while forcing 92. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "This is the fifth straight game we haven't allowed over 40 points in the second half. That just tells me our defense is right where it needs to be."
 -- Knicks coach  Mike Woodson . 
 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Orlando led, 80-79, when  Jason Kidd  nailed a 3-pointer with 8:44 remaining. Kidd followed with a nine-foot runner for his only other basket of the game, and the Knicks pulled away. 
 
 HOT:  J.R. Smith shot 9-for-14 overall, including 5-for-5 with a 3-pointer in a 12-point third quarter. 
 
 NOT:  The Magic's  Arron Afflalo  shot 4-for-14 with seven turnovers, six of them in the second half. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  New York used excellent ball movement to set up  Raymond Felton , Smith,  Steve Novak  and  Pablo Prigioni  for 3-pointers late in the first quarter and early in the second, building a 10-point lead. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  After a big first half (10 points, six rebounds), Magic rookie  Maurice Harkless  played only seven minutes in the second half. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "We've got to finish games. We can't use being young as an excuse. We've got to learn. We've got to get it now or we're going to look up and we'll be 2-10. I'm not used to that. I've never been on a 2-10 team."
 -- Magic forward  Glen Davis . 
 
 
 IN THE ARENA:  The game was held up for more than 10 minutes after the first quarter when  Jamie Woode , a member of the Magic Stunt Team, fell on her head. She was taken from the arena on a stretcher and taken to to a local hospital, where she was reported breathing on her own and moving her extremities. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Magic rookies Harkless and  Andrew Nicholson  combined for 21 points, nine rebounds and four blocks in 29 minutes. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Knicks made it to the NBA Finals in 1969-70 and 1993-94, the only other seasons in which they started 5-0. ... After scoring 68 and 74 points in their two preceding games, the Magic had 53 at halftime. ... Magic point guard  Jameer Nelson  missed his sixth game with hamstring and groin issues. He will probably play Friday night. ... Orlando's Redick missed his fourth free throw of the season. He did not miss his fourth free throw last season until Dec. 23. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Knicks: Thursday @ San Antonio, Friday @ Memphis, Sunday vs. Indiana. For the Magic: Friday @ Detroit; Sunday @ Toronto; Monday @ Atlanta.
