 THE FACTS: Spencer Hawes  played one of his best all-around games in a Philadelphia 76ers uniform with a season-high 24 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists in their 106-97 victory over the Brooklyn Nets Monday night at the Wells Fargo Center. Hawes led six Philadelphia players in double figures.  Thaddeus Young  and  Evan Turner  scored 16 points each while  Jrue Holiday  and  Dorell Wright  added 15 points apiece for the Sixers.  Damien Wilkins  scored 13 points for Philadelphia, which snapped a five-game losing streak and improved to 24-39. 
 
 Deron Williams  led the Nets with 27 points and 13 assists,  Joe Johnson  scored 20 points and  Brook Lopez  had 19.  Reggie Evans  swept 11 rebounds for the Nets (37-27), who had won three in a row entering this game. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It's been tough. No one likes to lose and I know that I've been taking it home. It's nice to get a big win and see all the happy faces in this locker room. It's been a while." --  Hawes. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Sixers shot 18-for-27 at the free throw line while the Nets were 11-for-16. It's the first time the Sixers have had as many or more free throws than the opponent since December 8 at Boston. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  After the Nets sliced a 14-point deficit to five midway through the fourth quarter, the Sixers responded with five straight, extending the lead back to 10. The Nets made one last surge, but it was too little too late. 
 
 HOT:  Hawes was 10-for-15, Young was 6-for-9 and Wright was 6-for-10. The Sixers shot 40-for-76 -- 52.6 percent. 
 
 NOT: Gerald Wallace  missed six of his eight shots and finished with just four points in 25:37. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Our guys came with a real sense of purpose." --  Sixers coach  Doug Collins. 
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Hawes had 24 points, 10 rebounds, seven assists and two blocked shots. Williams was solid for the Nets with 27 points, 13 assists and six rebounds. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The crowd was rather lively for this matchup against the upstart Nets. New Philadelphia Eagles coach  Chip Kelly  met with Collins before the game. Collins was asked sarcastically before the game if he had any "words of warning" for Kelly. "I told him just the opposite, what an incredible city this is and how much they love their Eagles, the fan base here and stuff," Collins said. "It was just the opposite. I said, he couldn't find a better place to be a coach." Former Sixers center  Darryl Dawkins  was also in attendance and received a nice ovation. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "I think they wanted the game a little bit more than us." --  Williams. 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Sixers continued to run offense through Hawes. He started strong and ended even stronger. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Nets probably could have played Wallace for longer stretches, especially with his defense prowess. When Wallace was on the bench, the Sixers seemed to get to the basket more often. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Nets guard  Tyshawn Taylor  and forward  Tornike Shengelia  each received a DNP-CD. Forward  Mirza Teletovic  had four points and six rebounds in 17:01. For the Sixers, forward  Arnett Moultrie  had two points and two rebounds in 9:41. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Sixers guard  Nick Young  was out with a sprained left ankle. ... The Sixers wished a happy 91st birthday to Sixers Director of Statistical Information  Harvey Pollack . He is former PR director of the 76ers and the Philadelphia Warriors. Pollack has only missed three home or neutral-site games since 1946. ... The Sixers have scored 100 or more points in three of the past seven games. ... Philadelphia had a season-high tying 31 assists. ... Three Sixers registered a double-double in the same game for the first time this season. In addition to Hawes, Young had 16 points and 10 rebounds while Holiday added 15 points and 11 assists. ... Williams scored his 10,000th career point on a free throw with 9:23 remaining. He needed 23 points reach 10,000 and wound up with 27. Williams, on what the milestone meant to him: "Nothing really. Just another number." ... The Sixers are 8-1 when shooting 50 percent or better this season.
