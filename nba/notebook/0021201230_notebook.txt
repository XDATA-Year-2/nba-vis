 THE FACTS: Klay Thompson  poured in 24 points and  David Lee  added 20 points and 10 rebounds as the Golden State Warriors beat the Portland Trail Blazers 99-88 Wednesday night at the Rose Garden to claim the sixth seed in the Western Conference playoffs.  
 
 Stephen Curry  added 15 points and set the NBA single-season record for 3-pointers for the Warriors (47-35), who face a first-round matchup against No. 3 Denver.  LaMarcus Aldridge  collected 30 points and a season-high 21 rebounds for Portland (33-49) despite sitting for the entire fourth quarter. It was the 13th straight loss for the Trail Blazers, matching the franchise record set in 1971-72. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "There's a lot to be proud of. We talked about chopping down accomplishments one by one, but the big accomplishment is continuing to win and moving forward." -- Golden State coach  Mark Jackson 
 
 
 THE STAT : Curry entered the game trailing  Ray Allen  (Seattle, 2005-06) by one trey. Curry made 4-for-11 from beyond the arc and hiked his season total to 272, three more than Allen's previous mark. 
 
 TURNING POINT : The Warriors led only 76-73 when they went on a 10-2 run for an 86-75 lead with 5:20 remaining. The Blazers could get no closer than nine the rest of the way. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "I'm disappointed in the season. I'm disappointed we lost tonight. I'm disappointed I couldn't play. I don't look at [the season as] rebuilding. I thought we had enough firepower to be playing on April 20."  
 -- Portland guard  Wesley Matthews , who missed the game due to a sprained ankle 
 
 HOT : Aldridge scored 14 of Portland's 17 first-quarter points and kept on rolling, scoring his 30 points in only 32 minutes. 
 
 NOT : Golden State is trying to work center  Andrew Bogut  back into form from an ankle injury, but the 7-footer couldn't find the range, making 1 of his 8 shots. 
 
 GOOD MOVE : Aldridge went inside often, pounding the ball at Lee in a matchup that has been fierce with plenty of give-and-take all season. 
 BAD MOVE: The Blazers' defense couldn't keep up with Golden State's firepower. 
 
 QUOTABLE III :  "It's special. I grew up watching Ray Allen shoot in shooting drills when he played with my dad in Milwaukee. I have an appreciation for how well he shot the ball in his career, and especially that one season. My teammates helped me along the way, setting screens and running our offense. It's a pretty special moment for everybody."  
 -- Stephen Curry, son of former NBA sharpshooter Dell Curry, on his 3-point record 
 
 NOTABLE : Curry and Thompson built on their NBA single-season 3-point record, making nine Wednesday to finish at 483. ... Lillard averaged 19.1 points and 6.5 assists, joining  Oscar Robertson, Allen Iverson  and  Damon Stoudamire  as the only rookies in history average better than 19 points and six assists. Lillard played 3,167 minutes, becoming the first rookie to lead the category since  Elvin Hayes  in 1968-69. ... Aldridge finished with a career-high 38 double-doubles, combining with  J.J. Hickson  (40) for 78, the most by any two teammates in the NBA this season. 
 UP NEXT: For the Warriors, playoffs, against the Nuggets. For the Blazers, end of season.
