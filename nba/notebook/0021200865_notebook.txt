 THE FACTS :   Carmelo Anthony  scored 30 points and  Raymond Felton  had 23 as the New York Knicks finished off the Washington Wizards with runs starting and ending the fourth quarter for a 96-88 win on Friday night. 
 
 J.R. Smith  finished with 13 points and a career-high 12 rebounds for the Knicks (35-20), who opened the fourth quarter with 10 straight points and then ended the game on a 9-2 spurt. New York gained revenge after falling at Washington last month.  Bradley Beal  scored a career-high 29 points and grabbed 11 rebounds for the Wizards (18-39), who have lost two straight.  John Wall  had 16 points, T revor Ariza  15 and  Emeka Okafor  had 11 points and 10 rebounds.  
 Washington led 77-73 entering the fourth quarter, but missed its first seven shots of the quarter. Anthony's layup gave the Knicks their largest lead of fourth quarter at 87-79. The Wizards went on a 7-0 run with Beal's fourth 3-pointer making it 87-86. However, the Wizards never made another field goal and Anthony's 3-pointer with 2:23 extended New York's lead to 92-87. 
 
 QUOTABLE : " We locked down in spurts. Still not where we really want to be. We had the game won a few times, but let them back in [a few] times. We finally got rebounds, loose balls starting falling our way and after that it was off to the races." 
 -- J.R. Smith on the Knicks finally closing out the back-and-forth game 
 
 THE STAT : The Wizards missed 14 of their 17 field goal attempts in the fourth quarter with Beal and Wall combining to go 2-for-10. Washington, which had not lost two straight home games since Dec. 22-26, also coughed the ball up six times in the fourth. 
 
 QUOTABLE II :  "We had, I think, three or four open floor turnovers, where we didn't get a shot. In a tight game, gotta get an attempt." 
 -- Wizards coach  Randy Wittman  on his team's struggles 
 
 HOT : Free throws are never the sexiest stat, but the Knicks sank 18 of their 21 including 8-for-9 from Anthony. The Wizards were 19-for-29 attempts.  
 
 NOT : With  Nene  missing his second straight game with a right shoulder injury,  Chris Singleton  made his first start since Dec. 18. It was not a memorable one for the second-year forward, who missed all six of his field goal attempts and played a scoreless 21 minutes. 
 
 GOOD MOVE : After starting 48 of his 49 games this season,  Jason Kidd  came off the bench, replaced by  James White . The 39-year-old Kidd, who shot 19.6 percent from the field in February, said he spoke with Knicks coach  Mike Woodson  before the game and agreed with the idea of the point guard's skills helping New York's second unit. Regardless of who started, Kidd played most of the fourth quarter and contributed directly to five points during a 10-0 run. 
 
 QUOTABLE III :  "The shots have no effect of what I do on the floor. I didn't come into the league as a scorer and it doesn't look like I'll leave as a scorer." 
 -- Jason Kidd 
 
 NOTABLE:  Amar'e Stoudamire  scored 12 points. ...The Knicks won despite shooting 8-for-28 from beyond the 3-point arc. ...Wizards point guard  A.J. Price  did not play after suffering a bruised right quad. Price had split the point guard duties with Wall in Washington's previous two games. ...The Knicks have won two of the three head-to-head meetings this season. The final matchup comes April 9 in New York. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Knicks, Sunday vs. Heat, Monday @ Cavaliers, Wednesday @ Pistons. For the Wizards, Sunday vs. 76ers, Wednesday @ Timberwolves, Friday @ Nets.
