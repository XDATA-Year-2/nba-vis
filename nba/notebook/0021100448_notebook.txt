  Notebook: Pistons 114, Kings 108 Posted Friday February 17, 2012 11:22PM By Dana Gauruder, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  Guard  Rodney Stuckey  had a season-high 36 points as the Detroit Pistons defeated the Sacramento Kings, 114-108, Friday night for their second straight victory. Rookie point guard  Brandon Knight  supplied his second double-double with 23 points and a career-high 10 assists as Detroit reached its season high in points. Center  DeMarcus Cousins  led the Kings with 26 points and 15 rebounds. QUOTABLE:  "Tonight was Stuck's night. He can get to the basket at will and draw fouls. He carried us and did a great job of just keeping us moving offensively. Not only that but the blocked shots and hustle plays he had really changed the game for us."   -- Knight on Stuckey's performance. THE STAT:  59. The Pistons beat the Kings at their own game, outscoring them on fast-break points, 30-29. Detroit hadn't given up more than 25 fast-break points this season (Chicago, Jan. 4) and hadn't scored more than 17 (vs. Dallas, Jan. 10) prior to Friday's shootout. The Pistons had a 17-6 advantage in fast-break points in the second half while outscoring the Kings, 58-48. TURNING POINT:  The Pistons trailed 104-102 before hitting two of their six 3-pointers. Knight made the first of those off a  Tayshaun Prince  kickout. Knight then found Stuckey open in the right corner after Sacramento's  Tyreke Evans  missed a 3-pointer. After Cousins scored, Knight drove across the lane for a layup with 1:11 remaining to preserve a four-point advantage. QUOTABLE II:  "He's a phenomenal player. I love playing with him. We're going to have a lot of years together and we're only going to get better."   -- Stuckey on Knight. HOT:  Stuckey is averaging 28 points over the last three games. His 36-point outburst Friday was four shy of his career high and his biggest output since he scored 38 against the Kings on Jan. 2, 2009. The last time he reached the 30-point mark was a 31-point performance against Oklahoma City on Dec. 18, 2009. NOT:  In the battle of highly-touted second-year centers, the Pistons'  Greg Monroe  was clearly the loser. He had a season-low three points on 1-of-7 shooting against Cousins, who shot 11-of-19 from the field and outrebounded Monroe 15-8. GOOD MOVE:   Isaiah Thomas  made his first start at The Palace since April 1994. Well, not quite. Thomas, the Kings' rookie guard out of Washington, made his first career start in the same building where Isiah Thomas spent a good portion of his Hall of Fame career. The Kings' Thomas had 13 points and four assists and helped Sacramento score 31 first-quarter points. BAD MOVE:  Kings coach  Keith Smart  only played Thomas three seconds during the fourth quarter and stuck too long with reserves  Travis Outlaw ,  Jimmer Fredette  and  Chuck Hayes  down the stretch as the Pistons outscored Sacramento 28-20 in the fourth. NOTABLE:  Prince had his first double-double this season with 22 points and a season-high 10 rebounds. ... Guard  Marcus Thornton  added 24 for Sacramento but went scoreless in the fourth. ... Detroit's previous high point total was 109 against New Jersey Feb. 10. It was just the second time the Pistons have reached 100 points in regulation. UP NEXT:  For the Kings, Sunday @ Cleveland, Tuesday @ Miami, Wednesday @ Washington. For the Pistons, Sunday vs. Boston, Tuesday @ Cleveland, Wednesday @ Toronto.
