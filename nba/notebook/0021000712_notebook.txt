  Wizards-Mavericks notebook   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Tuesday February 1, 2011 1:21AM THE FACTS: Dirk Nowitzki  scored a game-high 24 points and  Tyson Chandler  registered his 10th double-double with 18 points and 18 rebounds as the Mavericks kept the visiting Wizards winless on the road with a 102-92 victory Monday. Dallas has won five straight and Washington, now 0-24 away from home, has dropped five straight.  Rashard Lewis  and  Nick Young  led the Wizards with 18 points each. QUOTABLE:  "They've got some talented guys that know how to play and can put the ball in the basket. We made them take tough shots and gave up some offensive rebounds that we didn't want to, but we got some great looks on the offensive end. This is a tough team to play, no matter what their record is. They come out and play hard."   --Mavericks guard  Jason Kidd THE STAT:  Superior ball handling kept Washington in the game. The Wizards scored 21 points off 14 turnovers by Dallas. Washington only turned the ball over seven times (once in the first half), bettering its previous season low of eight set Friday at Oklahoma City. TURNING POINT:  In a game that featured seven ties and 12 lead changes, the Mavericks were down by as many as 12 points in the first half. They were still trailing 60-58 midway through the third quarter, but sixth man  Jason Terry  scored eight points during a 16-8 run to finish the period and the Wizards never regained the lead. QUOTABLE II:  "It's tough to say we've lost 24 in a row. ... We're going to get one, sooner or later."   --Wizards head coach  Flip Saunders HOT:  Nowitzki followed up his 8-for-11 shooting night Saturday against Atlanta with a 7-for-11 effort from the field against Washington, a good sign that he is getting back into form after initially struggling when he returned from a nine-game injury absence. ... Chandler matched his season high for rebounds and set a new high for offensive boards (eight). NOT: Andray Blatche  posted his 11th double-double for the Wizards with 16 points and 13 rebounds, but he missed 12 of his first 14 shots from the field and finished 4-for-17. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Kidd narrowly missed his 107th career triple-double with 11 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds. ...  Yi Jianlian  had a busy game off the bench for Washington with 14 points, 11 rebounds, four steals and a blocked shot. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Attending the game were several members of the AFC champion Pittsburgh Steelers, in town for Sunday's Super Bowl XLV clash with the Green Bay Packers at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington. GOOD MOVE:  Mavericks head coach  Rick Carlisle  elected to start  Brian Cardinal  at small forward to replace  Sasha Pavlovic , who had started the previous six games before being released when his second 10-day contract expired. Cardinal was 3-for-5 from 3-point distance in the first half and finished with nine points and four rebounds. Starting Cardinal enabled Carlisle to keep his explosive bench tandem of  Shawn Marion  (14 points, nine rebounds) and Terry (14 points, eight assists) together. ROOKIE WATCH:  Point guard John Wall (17 points, 10 assists) collected his 17th double-double, the most by any Washington player since  Juwan Howard  had 17 in 1994-95. NOTABLE:  After shooting 90.1 percent (100-for-111) from the line during the first four games of their winning streak, the Mavericks cooled off against the Wizards. Dallas shot 67.6 percent (25-for-37). ... Only Dallas (29) in 1992-93 and the New Orleans Jazz (28) in 1974-75 have started seasons with more consecutive losses on the road than Washington. ... The Mavericks are 22-1 when scoring at least 100 points. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Wednesday @ New York, Friday @ Boston, Saturday @ Charlotte. For the Wizards, Tuesday @ New Orleans, Friday vs. Orlando, Saturday, vs. Atlanta.
