 THE FACT:  The Trail Blazers are 18-2 when  LaMarcus Aldridge  leads them in scoring. 
 
 THE LEAD:  LaMarcus Aldridge's 21 points and 13 rebounds led the Portland Trail Blazers to a 112-104 victory over the Boston Celtics on Saturday night at the Moda Center. 
 Aldridge paced six players scoring in double figures for the Blazers (28-9), including  Wesley Matthews  with 18 points and  Nicolas Batum  with 16.  Robin Lopez  collected 15 points and 13 rebounds and guard  Damian Lillard  scored 15 points with six assists for the winners. 
 
 Avery Bradley  tallied 25 points for the Celtics (13-25), who lost their eighth straight game and finished 0-5 on their West Coast road trip. 
 
 QUOTABLE:   "We tightened up our defense, got out in transition and played with a lot more energy the second half." 
 --  Damian Lillard 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Boston led through the entire first half, shooting .619 (26 for 42) through two quarters. The second half was a different story, the Celtics shooting at only a .339 clip (18 for 53) to finish the game at .463. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Portland got its first lead at 69-68 on a 3-pointer by Mathews with 7:30 left in the third quarter, part of a 11-0 run that gave the Blazers a 75-68 lead. Boston never got the lead back the rest of the way. 
 
 HOT:  Batum scored only 16 points, but 11 of them came in a third quarter in which the Blazers seized the lead for good.  
 
 NOT:  Lillard never found his range, making only five of 15 shots from the field. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We haven't been able to finish games out the way we want to. We had a chance to win multiple games on this trip. It's very frustrating. I guess we can use it as motivation."  
 --  Avery Bradley 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Boston, which had scored 100 points in only two of its previous 10 outings, went up and down the court with the Blazers in leading throughout the first half. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  In the second half, the Celtics' ploy didn't work nearly as well. They shot .339 and scored only 44 points after intermission. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "We're still a work in progress. There is room for improvement. I've said that from the beginning. We had a good start to the season, but we aren't a finished product. We have to incrementally grow -- basketball-wise, and everything else."  
 -- Blazers coach  Terry Stotts 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Aldridge notched his 21st double-double and had his 15th game of at least 20 points and 10 rebounds. Lopez had his 14th double-double. ... Aldridge has moved into the top 10 on the franchise career list in most statistical categories, including scoring (fourth), rebounds (fifth) and blocked shots (seventh). With 10,172 career points, he is 233 short of No. 3  Cliff Robinson . ... Lopez tied his career high of nine offensive rebounds, which he set against Philadelphia on Jan. 4. ... Bradley was two short of his season high in scoring and three shy of his career high. ... Boston is now 27-25 over the years in Portland, the only team to have a winning record against the Blazers at home. 
 
 NEXT:  For the Celtics, Monday vs. Houston, Wednesday vs. Toronto, Friday vs. L.A. Lakers. For the Trail Blazers, Wednesday vs. Cleveland, Friday @ San Antonio, Saturday @ Dallas.
