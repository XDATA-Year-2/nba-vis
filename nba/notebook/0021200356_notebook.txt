 THE FACTS:   Lou Williams  had a season-high 24 points,  Josh Smith  had 17 points and 13 rebounds to lead the Atlanta Hawks to a 100-95 overtime win over the Washington Wizards on Tuesday night.  
 
 Jordan Crawford  had a triple-double with 27 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists.  Nene  had 18 points and  Bradley Beal  had 17 for Washington, which has lost 19 of 22. 
 The Hawks outscored the Wizards 10-5 in overtime.  DeShawn Stevenson , who played in Washington for five seasons, hit a 3-pointer with 2:08 remaining to put Atlanta ahead.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I look up every morning to make sure the sky is up there, that it's not falling in on me." 
 -- Wizards coach  Randy Wittman  on his team's run of bad luck. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Crawford's triple-double, the second of his career, came one game after he shot 2-for-12 against Miami in Washington's 30-point loss last Saturday 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Stevenson's 3-pointer, which caused him to preen to the crowd. "A lot of people was talking smack," Stevenson said. "So I had to bring it out."   
 
 QUOTABLE II:    "Tonight was one of those games where you didn't play well. We didn't play with a lot of energy, so I just wanted to be aggressive any time I had the ball." 
 -- Williams on the Hawks' win despite playing poorly. 
 
 
 HOT:  Atlanta's  Kyle Korver  had 16 points on 5-for-6 from the field and 3-for-4 from 3-point range.  
 
 NOT:   Beal was 6-for-7 from the field in the first half and 2-for-15 after that. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:   Hawks coach  Larry Drew  put in Stevenson, who he was originally going to rest, after  Devin Harris  suffered a foot injury in the first half. Stevenson hit all three of his field goals, the first two-pointers he'd made in nine games. His previous 25 baskets came on 3-pointers. "I had no choice but to play DeShawn," Drew said. "And I'll you what, he really stepped it up big time for me." 
 
 BAD MOVE:   Wittman continuing to start  Emeka Okafor  at center despite his lack of rebounding. He had just two rebounds in 25 minutes.  Earl Barron , who rarely plays, had 14 in 26 minutes. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Washington is 0-4 in overtime and they've lost four by more than 10 points. Two of the overtime losses were to Atlanta. 
 
 IN THE ARENA:  Wittman was heckled by fans behind the Wizards bench. They were frustrated that Wittman removed Nene from the game during overtime after he exceeded the 20-minute limit placed upon him in his recovery from a left foot injury. "They're killing me. I had to turn around and say something today," Wittman said. 
 
 NEXT:   For the Hawks: Wednesday vs. Thunder, Friday @ Sixers, Saturday vs. Bulls. For the Wizards:  Wednesday @ Magic, Friday @ Pistons, Saturday vs. Pistons.
