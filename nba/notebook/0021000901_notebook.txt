  Rockets-Blazers notebook   By Kerry Eggers, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday March 2, 2011 1:05AM THE FACTS:   Kyle Lowry  scored 21 points and dished out 11 assists and Houston led almost from start to finish in a 103-87 rout of the Trail Blazers Tuesday night at the Rose Garden.  Luis Scola  scored 21 points and  Kevin Martin  bombed in 20 for the Rockets (31-31).  Nicolas Batum  led Portland (33-27) with 22. QUOTABLE:  "We did a nice job of moving the ball and keeping them at bay, and we did a nice job of following our defensive plan. It was one of the best road wins we've had all year."    -- Houston coach  Rick Adelman . THE STAT:  The Rockets made 11 of their first 15 shots and never cooled, finishing at .572 from the field. It was the second-best an opponent has shot against Portland all season. TURNING POINT:  Ahead 53-42 at the half, Houston scored the first six points of the third quarter to build a 17-point lead. The Blazers never got closer than 11 the rest of the way. QUOTABLE II:  "This was a repeat of last game. I don't know where our swagger or spirit is. We look like we're not having fun. There's no connection out on that floor. I don't recognize that team, what we did tonight and in our last game."    -- Portland coach  Nate McMillan , after back-to-back losses to Atlanta and Houston. HOT:  Scola made his first five shots and scored 10 of Houston's first 18 points. He finished 10-for-11 from the field. NOT:  Portland's  Wesley Matthews  never found the range, making only 2-for-10 attempts from the field. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Lowry filled out the stat sheet with 21 points, 11 assists, four rebounds and two steals. INSIDE THE ARENA:  It was the 145th straight sellout at the Rose Garden (including playoffs) dating to December 2007. GOOD MOVE:  Houston defended 6-foot-11  LaMarcus Aldridge  with 6-foot-6  Chuck Hayes  and sent double-team help Aldridge's way at every touch. Aldridge, averaging 22.4 points and 9.1 rebounds, finishing with 14 points and three boards on 5-for-11 shooting. BAD MOVE:  The Blazers rarely got into the open court, scoring only two fast-break points. ROOKIE WATCH:  Houston forward  Patrick Patterson  had seven great minutes in the second quarter, making 3-for-4 shots from the field for six points, grabbing three rebounds and swatting two shots. NOTABLE:  Houston doubled up on Portland in points in the paint (52-26) despite having very little post game. The Rockets drove to the basket for uncontested shots all night long. UP NEXT:  For the Blazers, at Sacramento Wednesday, vs. Charlotte Saturday, at Orlando Monday. For the Rockets, at L.A. Clippers Wednesday, vs. Indiana Saturday, at Sacramento Monday.
