 THE FACT:   The Pistons dominated the scoring in the paint, putting up a 52-38 edge over the Wizards. Detroit's starting center and both forwards all scored in double figures. 
 
 THE LEAD: Josh Smith  scored 20 of his 22 points in the second half and  Rodney Stuckey  added 20 to lead the Detroit Pistons to a 104-98 win over the Washington Wizards on Saturday night. 
 Smith missed all six of his field goal attempts in the first half for Detroit (17-23), but he was 8-for-11 from the field in the second half as the Pistons overcame a 60-50 Washington advantage. Stuckey's jumper midway through the fourth quarter gave Detroit the lead. The Wizards (19-20), who were led by  John Wall 's 34, lost for a third time in their attempt to get over .500 for the first time since Oct. 31, 2009. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It was something I had to build within myself, just knowing that shots weren't falling for me, but I wanted to be able to stay positive, stay aggressive." 
 -- Detroit's Josh Smith on tuirning around his shooting mid-game 
 
 
 THE STAT:   A night after scoring just four points in a 21-point loss to Utah, Smith scored 20 in the second half.  
 
 TURNING POINT:   When Washington took a 60-50, Smith led a 20-6 run that gave the Pistons a four-point lead. They never trailed after that.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I think sometimes we pressure ourselves on that too much. Somebody just needs to not tell us our record and we'll just go out and play. Every time they tell us '.500', we just pressure ourselves too much and end up not showing up." 
 --Wizards' guard  Bradley Beal  on the team's inability to get over .500. 
 
 
 HOT:   Smith was 5-for-8 from the field in the third quarter and hit all three of his shots in the fourth.   
 
 NOT:  Both team's free-throw shooting was awful. Detroit was just 18-for-31 (58.1 percent). Washington shot 16-for-29 (55.2 percent).   
 
 GOOD MOVE:   Smith kept shooting in the second half after his first half no-show.   
 
 BAD MOVE:  Wizards'  Jan Vesely  extended his streak of missed free throws to 14 when he threw up an airball on a possible three-point play in the second quarter. In the third, he converted the first of two. He hadn't made one since Dec. 2.  
 
 NOTABLE:  Washington's  Trevor Booker  suffered a sprained left ankle early in the second quarter and did not return. Wizards coach  Randy Wittman  said Booker would be evaluated on Sunday.  
 
 IN THE ARENA:  Jay Gruden, the new coach of the Washington Redskins was introduced to the crowd during the third quarter and received a big ovation. 
 
 UP NEXT:   For the Pistons, Monday vs. L.A. Clippers, Wednesday @ Milwaukee, Friday vs. New Orleans. For the Wizards, Monday vs. Philadelphia, Wednesday vs. Boston, Friday @Phoenix.
