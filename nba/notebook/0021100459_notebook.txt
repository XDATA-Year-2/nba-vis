  Notebook: Trail Blazers 97, Hawks 77 Posted Sunday February 19, 2012 1:48AM By Kerry Eggers, for NBA.com    THE FACTS: Nicolas Batum  scored 22 points and grabbed eight rebounds to lead Portland past Atlanta 97-77 Saturday night at the Rose Garden. The Trail Blazers (17-15) also got 19 points and 10 rebounds from  LaMarcus Aldridge , returning after missing two games with a sprained left ankle.  Joe Johnson  scored 19 points for Atlanta (19-12), on the third game of a five-game road trip. Teammate  Josh Smith  finished an assist shy of a triple-double with 14 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists. QUOTABLE:  "We came out from the start and put pressure on them. If you give anybody life, they can find it. But we kept working and ended up winning the game."   --  Aldridge THE STAT:  The Blazers, who had been outrebounded in seven of their previous eight games, won the rebound battle 50-27. TURNING POINT:  Portland led 33-28 early in the second quarter, but the Blazers outscored the Hawks 19-9 the rest of the quarter to go into the half ahead 52-37. Atlanta never got closer than 12 points the rest of the way. QUOTABLE II:  "We got off to a good start, but (the Blazers) got off to a good start, too. We just had too many (defensive) breakdowns in the second quarter. They made shots and then we didn't make shots."    -- Atlanta coach  Larry Drew , whose Hawks started the game 8-for-11, then were 22-for-62 (.355) the rest of the way. HOT:  Portland made 14 of its first 18 shots and ran out to a 33-25 lead after one quarter, two points shy of its season-high scoring total for the first period. NOT:  Atlanta's  Jeff Teague  was 1-for-10 from the field, including 0-for-3 from 3-point range. QUOTABLE III:  "The bounces weren't going our way, but that's when we have to be a little more desperate. They were able to get their hands on balls and give themselves second opportunities to score."   -- Smith INSIDE THE ARENA:  The crowd announced at 20,635 was the Blazers' 176th straight sellout at the Rose Garen dating to December 2007. GOOD MOVE:  Portland went to Aldridge early and he responded with four straight baskets in the opening 4 1/2 minutes. NOTABLE:  Portland snapped a four-game home losing streak, its longest since December 2006/January 2007. The Blazers had also lost six straight to Atlanta in the series dating to February 2009. UP NEXT:  For the Blazers, Monday @ L.A. Lakers, Tuesday @ San Antonio, Feb. 29 @ Denver. For the Hawks, Monday @ Chicago, Wednesday @ New York, Thursday @ Orlando.
