 THE FACTS:  LaMarcus Aldridge  scored 31 points and grabbed 12 rebounds and front-line mate  J.J. Hickson  collected 18 points and 15 boards in Portland's 112-101 victory over Detroit on Saturday night at the Rose Garden,  Nicolas Batum  contributed 17 points, six assists, five rebounds and three blocked shots for the Trail Blazers (31-34), who rallied from a five-point halftime deficit to win their second straight game.  Rodney Stuckey  scored a season-high 32 points and  Will Bynum  came off the bench to add 23 for the Pistons (23-45), who lost for the eighth straight time and finished their road trip 0-4. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I just felt good tonight. I started kind of slow, but in the second half, I found my rhythm. I guess I was feeling it."  
 
 -- Aldridge 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Detroit shot 58.1 percent in the first half and 52.6 for the game. Portland was 0-for-14 against opponents shooting better than 50 percent this season. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Detroit led 57-52 at the half, but Portland started the third quarter on a 9-0 run to take a 61-57 advantage. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "No tooth, and now I have to go get stitches. I'm good, though."  
 
 -- Stuckey, who dislodged a tooth and took a cut to the forehead in a third-quarter collision with Portland's  Damian Lillard 
 
 
 HOT:  Aldridge was 13-for-21 from the field and 5-for-5 from the foul line and was sensational in a third-quarter stretch in which he knocked down four straight tough jumpers. 
 
 NOT:  Lillard had 14 points and seven assists but was 3-for-12 from the field. In his two games against Detroit, the rookie point guard 7-for-30. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  When Aldridge got two early fouls, Portland coach  Terry Stotts  went to little-used rookie  Joel Freeland . The 6-foot-11 Brit rewarded him with eight points on 4-for-6 shooting and two rebounds in seven first-quarter minutes. 
 
 GOOD MOVE II:  Batum came from behind to get all three of his blocked shots -- all against Detroit rookie  Kyle Singler . 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "During the game, I was joking with him. I said, 'I think I'm rubbing off on you.' "  
 
 -- Hickson, on Aldridge 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Hickson has 37 double-doubles, tied for second in the NBA behind Golden State's  David Lee . Aldridge has 31 double-doubles and five games with at least 30 points, 10 rebounds and 50 percent shooting -- tied with Miami's  LeBron James  for the league lead in that category. ... Aldridge, James and Oklahoma City's  Kevin Durant  are the only players with 1,300 points and 500 rebounds. ... It was Portland's 12th win when trailing at halftime. ... Guard  Brandon Knight , who scored 26 points in Detroit's 108-101 win over Portland on Nov. 26, missed his second straight game with a sprained ankle. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Pistons, Monday vs. Brooklyn, Friday @ Miami, Saturday @ Charlotte. For the Trail Blazers, Monday @ Philadelphia, Tuesday @ Milwaukee, Thursday @ Chicago.
