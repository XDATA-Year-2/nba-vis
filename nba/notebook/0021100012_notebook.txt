  Nuggets-Mavericks notebook   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Tuesday December 27, 2011 12:00AM THE FACTS:  For the second straight day, the defending champs looked defenseless.  Ty Lawson  scored 27 points to lead five Denver players in double figures as the Nuggets opened their season with a lopsided 115-93 victory Monday in Dallas.  Dirk Nowitzki  scored 20 for the Mavericks, who fell behind by more than 30 points for the second consecutive game and dropped to 0-2 on their home court. QUOTABLE:  "It's way too early to get crazy, but it felt good."  --  Nuggets head coach  George Karl THE STAT:  After giving up 30-plus points to Miami in each of the first three quarters on Sunday, the Mavericks allowed 32 points in the first quarter and 37 in the second to Denver. That's five of the first six quarters. Last season, no Dallas opponent registered a 30-point period until New Orleans scored 33 in the third quarter of the Mavericks' 10th game on Nov. 17, 2010. TURNING POINT:  After Jason Kidd drained a 3-pointer with 6:28 left in the second quarter to pull Dallas within 47-41, Denver scored 20 unanswered points until Nowitzki converted a technical free throw with 44.9 seconds remaining. Lawson scored nine of his 21 first-half points in that run, during which the Mavericks missed eight straight shots and committed six of their 20 turnovers. QUOTABLE II:  "We've got to rebuild trust defensively. We've lost some. We've lost a lot. I've got to do a better job coaching these guys, simple as that."  --  Mavericks head coach  Rick Carlisle. HOT:  Denver point guards Lawson and  Andre Miller  were a combined 16-for-23 from the field (5-for-8 from 3-point distance) and 8-for-8 at the line with nine assists, nine rebounds and six steals. Miller scored 18 points. NOT:  The Mavericks trailed by as many as 35 points (78-43) in Sunday's 105-94 loss to the Heat. They fell behind by 33 points (95-62) against the Nuggets. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Mavericks forward  Lamar Odom  shot 1-for-10 from the field (0-for-5 from long range) and finished with six points and seven rebounds. He's just 2-for-16 through two games.  Al Harrington  (18 points),  Danilo Gallinari  (15) and  Arron Afflalo  (11, all in the second half) also scored in double figures for Denver. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Just one day after the Mavericks raised the first championship banner in the franchise's 31-year history, fans at the American Airlines Center started booing the defending champs in the second quarter. ROOKIE WATCH:  Forward  Kenneth Faried , Denver's first-round pick (No. 22 overall), was inactive. "Being on the road ... first-game jitters," Karl said. Last season at Morehead State, Faried passed  Tim Duncan  to become the NCAA Division I modern-era (post-1973) career rebounding leader. NOTABLE:  The Mavericks have 21 more back-to-backs on the schedule, but only one more of the home-home variety (Jan. 13-14 vs. Milwaukee and Sacramento). ... The last time Dallas started 0-2 was in 2006-07 (0-4). ... Mavs forward  Sean Williams , playing in his first NBA game in nearly two years (Jan. 6, 2010 with the Nets), tossed in 12 points off the bench on 4-for-4 shooting before tossing his cookies on the sidelines. ... Eight players grabbed at least four rebounds for Denver, which won the battle of the boards 47-37. ... The Nuggets have won six of their last eight regular-season games played in Dallas. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Thursday @ Oklahoma City, Friday vs. Toronto, Sunday @ Minnesota. For the Nuggets, Wednesday vs. Utah, Thursday @ Portland, Saturday @ Los Angeles Lakers.
