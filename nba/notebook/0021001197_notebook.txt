  Hornets-Grizzlies notebook   By Marlon W. Morgan, for NBA.com Posted Monday April 11, 2011 12:11AM THE FACTS:  Leading by four at the half, the Memphis Grizzlies blitzed New Orleans in the third quarter in streaking to a 111-89 victory. The team's strong play from its bench, which scored a season-high 61 points, allowing the Grizzlies' starters to rest as they all played under 29 minutes. The Grizzlies were led by  O.J. Mayo's  18 points while  Marco Belinelli  had 18 for New Orleans, 16 of those coming in the first quarter. QUOTABLE:  "It felt real good to sit down. You have no idea. You get winded, especially this time of year. To play the amount of minutes I was, I was getting a little winded. To get to sit for a good period of time feels great. My legs feel great.''   --  Grizzlies point guard  Mike Conley. THE STAT:  The most glaring stat was that of New Orleans point guard  Chris Paul.  For the first time in is career, Paul was held scoreless, going 0 for 6 from the floor and 0 for 2 from the free throw line, although he did manage to dish out 10 assists. Paul played just over 28 minutes. TURNING POINT:  New Orleans was still in the game at 69-61 with 3:46 left in the third quarter. The Hornets were then outscored 28-10 in the next 7 1/2 minutes as the Grizzlies went up 97-71. ROOKIE SPOTLIGHT:  Grizzlies rookie point guard  Greivis Vasquez  made sure starter Mike Conley would be able to get some much needed rest. Vasquez scored a career-high 13 points and had five assists in 22 minutes. HOT:  The Grizzlies remained hot throughout the game. Their best quarter was the first in which they made 13 of 18 shots (72.2 percent). They never shot less than 53 percent in any quarter, that one being the third quarter in which they made 8 of 15 attempts. The Grizzlies finished the game shooting 60.3 percent, their fourth highest shooting percentage in franchise history. NOT:  The Hornets managed to stay close in the first half due to their 3-point shooting. They made 5 of 8 to start the game, four of those coming from Marco Belinelli. But after the first quarter, the Hornets missed six of their next nine 3's and couldn't score in the paint (28 points). QUOTABLE II:  "I just couldn't make anything. There is a first time for everything. It's funny, I think two years ago when we played Memphis, I think I scored two points. I had 43, 40 and then a two-point game against them. I don't know. It is what it is. I had some good looks tonight. They just didn't go in.''   --  New Orleans guard Chris Paul. NOTABLE:  With the win, the Grizzlies pulled even with New Orleans at 46-34. With the teams splitting their four games this season, New Orleans holds the tiebreaker by virtue of a better divisional record. New Orleans is now 9-6 in the Southwest Division with a game against Dallas remaining, while the Grizzlies finish the season at 8-8. The Grizzlies did, however, pull to within a game of sixth place Portland. The two teams meet for the final time in Portland Tuesday night with the season series tied at 1-1...Mayo led the Grizzlies in scoring in a victory for the first time since Dec. 15 against Charlotte...The Grizzlies finished the home portion of the season with 30 wins which ties for second-most in team history, joining the 2005-06 squad. The record is 31 set by the 2003-04 team...Memphis is now a season-high 12 games over .500, its most since finishing the 2005-06 season at 49-33.
