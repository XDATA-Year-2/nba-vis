 THE FACT: Kevin Durant  had his 14th 30-point game of the season, which leads the NBA, and netted a game-high 34 points including 14 in the fourth quarter in Oklahoma City's win. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Oklahoma City played without three-time all-star  Russell Westbrook,  who will be sidelined until at least the All-Star break after knee surgery, and held on to defeat the pesky Charlotte Bobcats 89-85 Friday night at Time Warner Cable Arena.  
 Durant scored a game-high 34 points, grabbed a game-best 12 rebounds and led five Thunder (24-5) players in double figures. The Bobcats were led by  Kemba Walker 's 18 points.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I just wanted to attack. I had a bigger guy on me most of the game and I just tried to be aggressive." 
 -- Oklahoma City forward Kevin Durant 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Oklahoma City is now 8-1 this season when holding its opponents to sub-40.0 percent field-goal shooting. Charlotte was 30-for-80 (37.5 percent) on the night. The Thunder has limited its opponent to the second worst field-goal shooting percentage in the NBA. Oklahoma City is also 7-0 when holding the opposition under 95 points.  
 
 TURNING POINT : With the Thunder seemingly in the driving seat late in the fourth quarter, the Bobcats staged a quick rally to make things interesting.  Anthony Tolliver 's 3 sliced an eight-point cushion to just five points. Walker continued the scoring burst with back-to-back baskets, which pulled the Bobcats within a point at 86-85 with just 14.9 seconds to play. The Thunder managed to hit three of four free throws down the stretch and hold on for the win.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Tonight, we really locked down on defense. We could not hit shots and just grinded them down on the defensive end. That's what got us the win tonight." 
 -- Oklahoma City guard  Jeremy Lamb 
 
 
  HOT:  Durant had the hot hand, especially when it counted, for Oklahoma City Friday night. Durant was 14-for-28 from the floor and scored a game-high 34 points. He also grabbed 12 rebounds for his 11th double-double of the season and led the Thunder with six assists. He has 14 30-point games, including three in his last six outings. He also has six games with at least 30 points and 10 rebounds.  
 
 NOT :  Reggie Jackson  struggled offensively Friday after replacing the injured Westbrook in the OKC starting lineup. Jackson was just off his season average with 10 points against Charlotte, but it took him 19 shots to get that total. Jackson, who was second in the league in free-throw shooting, also missed one of his two attempts at the charity stripe.  
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:   Al Jefferson  had a double-double with 16 points and 11 rebounds. It was his 17th consecutive double-figure game. He has a double-double in four of his last five games and nine of the last 14 games. During the 14-game stretch, he is averaging 17.6 points, 10.8 rebounds and 1.6 assists.  
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The Carolina Panthers had a big presence at Time Warner Cable Arena Friday night. Among those in attendance was quarterback Cam Newton and wide receivers Steve Smith, Brandon LaFell and Ted Ginn Jr. 
 
 NOTABLE:   The Bobcats are now 8-4 when making at least five 3s ... Charlotte has been held to an average of 85.9 points per game over the last eight games with Oklahoma City ... The Bobcats defense has now held 23 of its 30 games to date, which is tops in the league ... Walker scored 18 points, recording his 19th straight game in double figures and 27th overall ...  Serge Ibaka  has a streak of 22 games with at least one blocked shot, which is more than double the length of the next closest player ... OKC was won 11 of its last 12 games and 19 of its last 21 games and are tied for the best record in the league with Portland ... The Thunder are 19-2 when outrebounding its opponent on the year ... Oklahoma City recorded their seventh consecutive road victory, the longest single-season road winning streak during the Oklahoma City era ... the Thunder improved to 11-1 over the last 12 games against Charlotte. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Thunder, Sunday vs. Houston, Tuesday vs. Portland, Thursday vs. Brooklyn. For the Bobcats, Saturday @ Atlanta, Monday @ Utah, Wednesday @ Clippers.
