 THE FACTS : Reserves  Rodrigue Beaubois, Brandan Wright  and  Darren Collison  rallied the Dallas Mavericks to a 96-86 victory Friday against the visiting Cleveland Cavaliers. Those three players accounted for all of the Mavericks' points in a decisive 17-4 run to start the fourth quarter, giving surging Dallas (31-34) its fifth win in six games. All five starters scored in double figures for Cleveland (22-43), but its bench was outscored by a whopping 60-19 margin. 
 Beaubois was 3-for-5 from downtown and contributed 18 points and five assists in 21 minutes. It was first game in double figures since Jan. 25 and one point shy of his season high. Collison and Wright each had 13 points along with  Dirk Nowitzki,  who added 11 rebounds for his third straight double-double. 
 
 Dion Waiters  paced the Cavaliers with 21 points and fellow rookie  Tyler Zeller  added 10 points and 10 boards. Cleveland led by as many as 11 points and didn't trail until the 5:27 mark of the third quarter, but shot 36.8 percent (7-for-19) and committed six of its 18 turnovers in the fourth. The Cavaliers have lost five of the last six meetings with the Mavericks and 10 of their last 12 in Dallas. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "We missed a bunch of wide-open shots in the second half, and they made a bunch of wide-open shots. That was the difference I thought between the first half and the second half." 
 --Cleveland coach  Byron Scott 
 
 
 THE STAT : Even though the Mavericks were playing the second game of a back-to-back and the Cavaliers had not played since Tuesday, the Mavericks played with more energy in the second half and were much more effective at running the fast break. Dallas outscored Cleveland 19-4 in transition. 
 
 TURNING POINT : Trailing 68-67, Dallas seized control with a 17-4 surge that included eight points by Wright (two dunks and two layups), seven by Beaubois and a layup by Collison. 
 
 HOT : Dallas shot 70.6 percent (12-for-17) in the third quarter, including 3-for-4 from behind the arc. 
 
 NOT : The Mavericks missed 10 of their first 11 field-goal attempts and shot 33.3 percent (7-for-21) in the first quarter. Their 38 first-half points matched a season low. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT : Dallas sixth man  Vince Carter  only scored seven points, but his 3-pointer with 1:33 remaining was his 8,000th-career field goal. He is just the 33rd player in NBA history to reach that milestone. The only active players with more field goals are  Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan , Nowitzki and  Ray Allen . It was also Carter's 100th-career appearance off the bench. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH : Mavericks forward  Jae Crowder  grabbed a game- and career-high 14 rebounds. 
 
 NOTABLE : An MRI on Friday revealed a left calf strain for Mavericks forward  Shawn Marion , not the contusion the team suspected. He missed his fifth straight game and is not expected back anytime soon. Marion averages 11.7 points and a team-high 7.9 rebounds. ... Cavaliers guard  Wayne Ellington  was a late scratched with a sprained left ankle. ... It was the Mavericks' first win this season when scoring fewer than 20 points in the first quarter (1-5). ... Dallas is 15-2 when shooting 50 percent from the field and 19-8 when holding opponents under 100 points. ... Cleveland is 2-10 on the road against the West. ... Point guard  Chris Wright , the first NBA player with multiple sclerosis, made his Dallas debut and converted a layup with 9.4 seconds remaining for his first career points. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Mavericks, Sunday vs. Oklahoma City, Monday @ Atlanta, Wednesday vs. Brooklyn. For the Cavaliers, Saturday @ San Antonio, Monday vs. Indiana, Wednesday vs. Miami.
