 THE FACT:  Just two of Indiana's 12 wins have come against teams that entered Saturday night with winning records (Chicago and Memphis), and the cumulative record of the teams they've beaten was 49-86 (.363). 
 
 THE LEAD:   Roy Hibbert  scored 27 points, pulled 13 rebounds and blocked six shots as Indiana continued its NBA-best start with a 106-98 victory over visiting Philadelphia Saturday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. The Pacers (12-1) also got 19 points from  Paul George , 18 from  Lance Stephenson  and 17 with 11 rebounds from  David West . Philadelphia (6-9) was led by  Michael Carter-Williams  with 29 points, seven steals and six rebounds. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I don't care what anybody says, it's tough to play a game when you find out at the last minute that three or four of their top guys are out and you've got a lot of faces you're not familiar with, all playing to prove their worth, playing for opportunities."  --  Indiana coach  Frank Vogel. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Philadelphia missed 67 shots but rebounded 23 of them, converting those into 31 second-chance points. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Extending their defense and pounding the offensive glass, the Sixers opened the fourth quarter with a 19-4 run against the Indiana bench, taking a 85-81 lead on  Hollis Thompson's  3-pointer with 7:06 remaining. But the Pacers' starters returned and regained control with a 17-3 run of their own, holding the Sixers without a field goal for more than four minutes while building a 98-88 lead with 3:12 remaining. Philadelphia closed to 98-94 with 2:22 remaining but that's as close as the visitors would come. Hibbert had eight points, five rebounds and three blocks in the final 8:56. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We came out pretty strong. During the middle we faltered a little and didn't play Pacers basketball to the best of our abilities. We're an experienced team. We don't worry. We know that we can finish games."  --  Hibbert . 
 
 
 HOT:  Carter-Williams shot 11-for-21 for the Sixers. ... Hibbert was 7-for-12 and Stephenson 8-for-11 for Indiana.  
 
 NOT:  Aside from Carter-Williams, the Sixers shot 24-for-81 (.296). ...  James Anderson  was 4-for-18 overall, 1-for-10 from the 3-point line. ...  Evan Turner  shot 8-for-26 and missed all four of his 3-pointers. ... Indiana's second unit shot 4-for-19. ... Both teams were cold from the 3-point line, with the Sixers shooting 4-for-25 and the Pacers 5-for-18. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "Roy Hibbert ... he's a great defender. I don't know of many 7-footers you can attack 25 times and only have two fouls called against him. To be successful like that at a 95 percent clip, that doesn't make any sense to me."  --  Turner . 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Hibbert had career highs in free throws attempted (16) and made (13) ... Already shorthanded, the Sixers took a last-minute hit when center  Spencer Hawes  was unable to play due to left knee soreness.  Lavoy Allen  started in his place. ...  Tony Wroten , who sustained a lower back strain in Friday's 115-107 victory over Milwaukee and  Thaddeus Young  (personal reasons) also sat this one out for the Sixers. ... Indiana regained the services of backup point guard  C.J. Watson , who missed Friday's 97-82 victory in Boston with an upper respiratory infection. ... Indiana's point total, free throws (31) and free throw attempts (38) all were season highs. ... The Sixers shot 32 free throws, a season high for an Indiana opponent. ...  Daniel Orton  had his first career double-double with 10 points and 10 rebounds for Philadelphia. ... The Pacers are 5-0 against the Atlantic Division...This was Hibbert's seventh game this season with at least five blocks...Indiana has held 12 of its 13 opponents this season under 100 points...The Sixers have lost seven out of their last nine games...Turner has scored 20 points in 12 games this season.
