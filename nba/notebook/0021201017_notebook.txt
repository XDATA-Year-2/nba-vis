 THE FACTS : The Washington Wizards joined the growing list of teams ending lengthy road losing streaks in Phoenix.  John Wall  scored 19 points and added eight assists to lead the Wizards past the Suns 88-79 Wednesday night for their first victory in the Valley since December 22, 2006. 
 
 Nene  had 17 points and eight rebounds while  Kevin Seraphin  added 16 off the bench for Washington (24-43), which has won four of five and swept the season series against the Suns (23-46) for the first time since 2001-02. 
 
 Goran Dragic  scored 18 points and added 11 assists, and  Wesley Johnson  also scored 18 for the Suns, who have lost four of five. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "We didn't make it easy, but it was good to win that." 
 -- Wizards coach  Randy Wittmann 
 
 
 THE STAT : Washington played far from a perfect game -- the Wizards went 16-for-25 free throws and committed 21 turnovers leading to 21 points. But, after allowing the Suns to shoot 50 percent in the first quarter, Washington held Phoenix to 17-for-61 shooting (27.9 percent) the rest of the way. 
 
 TURNING POINT : The Wizards went on a 15-0 run early in the second quarter as part of a 17-2 start that brought them the lead. They went ahead after finding themselves in a one-point deficit, taking a 40-28 lead with 5:39 left in the first half. Washington, which held Phoenix without a field goal until the 4:24 mark of the period, extended its lead to as many as 18 points.  
 
 QUOTABLE II : "Defensively, that's what we take our pride in. When we play defense, we feel we can beat anybody." 
 -- John Wall 
 
 HOT : Washington's bench of  Trevor Ariza , Seraphin,  Bradley Beal  and  Trevor Booker  scored 32 first-half points on 14-for-19 shooting.  
 
 NOT : Pick a Suns player.  Jermaine O'Neal  was 3-for-11 before leaving the game with 1:05 left with a strained left calf. Dragic was 4-for-10 with four turnovers. And  Luis Scola  scored 11 points, but on just 5-for-12 shooting. 
 
 QUOTABLE III : "I wasn't happy with [any] of our young guys. It wasn't about mistakes they made, it was about effort." 
 --Suns coach  Lindsey Hunter 
 
 
 NOTABLE: Shannon Brown 's exile ended with 2:34 left in the third quarter. Brown, who had taken 13 DNPs in 14 games and played just eight minutes since the All-Star break, hit his first shot and finished with four points in eight minutes. ... If O'Neal is out for any length of time -- two teammates helped him to the locker room -- and with  Marcin Gortat  already out, the Suns' only healthy pivot is  Hamed Haddadi . ... Earlier this season, Milwaukee ended a 24-game losing streak Phoenix dating back to 1987. ... Three starters --  Jason Collins  and  Garrett Temple  for Washington and  Markieff Morris  for Phoenix -- did not score. 
 
 IN THE ARENA: P.J. Tucker  jumped over two rows of courtside seats to go after a loose ball, flying past a father and young son along the way. A few minutes later, the Suns gorilla came out and gave the youngster a Suns orange bicycle helmet. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Wizards, Friday @ L.A. Lakers, Saturday @ Golden State, Monday vs. Memphis. For the Suns, Friday vs. Minnesota, Sunday vs. Brooklyn, Wednesday @ Utah.
