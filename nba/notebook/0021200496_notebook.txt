 THE FACTS: Tony Parker  scored 20 points and  Manu Ginobili  came off the bench to add 19 as the San Antonio Spurs put an unforgiving end to Philadelphia's eight-game road streak with a 109-86 victory over the 76ers on Saturday at AT&T Center. 
 San Antonio (27-9) also got 16 points from  Tim Duncan  and double figures from three others (starters  Danny Green  and  Tiago Splitter  and reserve  Gary Neal ). 
 The Sixers (15-20) played four games in five nights -- including this back-to-back against Western Conference powers Oklahoma City and San Antonio -- but now will head back to Philadelphia. Though four starters scored in double figures,  Spencer Hawes  came off the bench to lead Philly with 22 points on 10-of-13 shooting. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "This would have been a tall order if we had eight days rest. This team (the Spurs) is as good as any team in the NBA."  --  76ers coach  Doug Collins. 
 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Sixers shot 40.5 percent last night in Oklahoma City and 41.7 tonight. Philly is 2-17 when failing to out-shoot opponents this season. 
 
 
 TURNING POINT:  San Antonio had a double-digit lead most of the night, but the Sixers had a chance to cut it to 11 when Hawes uncharacteristically missed a layup in the final minute of the third quarter. Hawes then committed two shooting fouls on Ginobili -- one that set up an and-one that Ginobili converted into a 3-point play -- and San Antonio scored the final five points of the third quarter.  
 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I didn't know they had been out on the road that long. That last game of that trip usually you try to give it your all, but you're usually dead out there. I can understand that. Our guys played well tonight. We made shots and we took them out."  --  Duncan. 
 
 
 HOT:  Hawes' 10-of-13 night comes at a good time. He entered the game with consecutive games of 3-of-11 shooting from the floor and also went 2-of-10 four games back at Portland. 
 
 NOT:  The Sixers went 3-of-17 from the 3-point line, including a combined 0-for-6 from  Nick Young  and  Evan Turner , and were outscored 24-9 from 3-point territory. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Though Parker's 20 points came with five assists and Ginobili added seven rebounds to his 19 points, Splitter had the only double-double of the night with 12 points and 10 rebounds. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Just four games back  Nando De Colo  enjoyed one of his better games of the season with 11 points off 4-of-7 shooting in 22 minutes against Brooklyn. It looked like he was becoming the backup at point guard for Parker, but he played 10 minutes tonight with three points and Neal started filling in as the second point. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Duncan passed  Adrian Dantley  for 24th on the all-time scoring list. ... The 76ers have a league-high 13 road games since December, but play 13 of the next 15 in Philadelphia. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the 76ers, Tuesday vs. Brooklyn, Wednesday @ Toronto, Saturday vs. Houston. For the Spurs, Monday @ New Orleans, Wednesday vs. L.A. Lakers, Friday @ Memphis.
