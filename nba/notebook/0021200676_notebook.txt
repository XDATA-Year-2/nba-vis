 THE FACTS:   Nate Robinson  scored 16 of his game-high 24 points in a pivotal second quarter as the Chicago Bulls cruised to a 104-88 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks Wednesday night at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. 
 Robinson had his way as the Bulls (28-17) built a 20-point lead and never allowed the Bucks to get closer than seven the rest of the way.  Jimmy Butler  added 18 points off the bench and  Luol Deng  (12 points, 13 rebounds) and  Joakim Noah  (12 and 12) had double-doubles. 
 
 Ersan Ilyasova  led the Bucks (24-20) with 18 points but made just 6-for-18.  Samuel Dalembert  had 14 points and 13 rebounds in his first start since Dec. 12. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "My teammates have been teasing me all season, talking about how I'm the three-time slam-dunk champion and I'm not getting any dunks. I don't dunk off one foot, so that kind of surprised everybody, including myself. My fans have been asking when I'm going to dunk again, so hopefully they'll get off my back now that they've seen me dunk and I don't have to dunk the rest of the season." 
 -- Nate Robinson, who at 5-foot-9 hadn't dunked yet this season but did so on a back-door cut and pass from Deng with 1:23 left in the half 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Chicago dominated inside all night long on its way to a season-high 66 points in the paint.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  Robinson played all but the final eight seconds of the second quarter and scored half of Chicago's 32 points. That helped turn a 23-19 lead after one quarter into a 55-37 edge at the half. Robinson's 16 second-quarter points nearly matched the Bucks' total of 18. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I've seen weirder things in this sport, but it just shows you that mindset is everything." 
 -- Joakim Noah on the fact that the road team won all four games in the season series 
 
 
 HOT:  Robinson shot a blistering 81.8 percent as he made 9-for-11 shots. Butler wasn't too far behind, going 8-for-12. 
 
 NOT: Brandon Jennings ,  Monta Ellis  and Ilyasova, Milwaukee's top three scorers in the starting lineup, each shot 33.3 percent. Jennings and Ilyasova were each 6-for-18, and Ellis was 4-for-12. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The crowd of 17,640, the Bucks' second-largest of the season, was probably about 40 percent Bulls fans who made the two-hour drive up from Chicago. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Bucks first-round pick  John Henson  had six points and three rebounds in eight minutes.  
 
 NOTABLE:  The teams split the season series, 2-2, with the road team winning all four games. ... Bulls forward  Carlos Boozer  sat out with a shoulder injury suffered in Monday's victory over Charlotte. He is day-to-day. ... Bucks center  Larry Sanders  missed the game with illness and wasn't in the arena. ... The Bucks couldn't get out of Detroit after Tuesday night's victory because of mechanical troubles with their charter plane and flew in at 11 a.m. Wednesday. ... The Bucks are now 4-7 in the second game of back-to-backs. ... The Bulls have won eight of their last 10 and now lead the Bucks by 3 ½ games in the Central Division. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Bulls, Friday @ Brooklyn, Saturday @ Atlanta, Monday @ Indiana. For the Bucks, Friday @ New York, Saturday vs. Orlando, Tuesday @ Denver.
