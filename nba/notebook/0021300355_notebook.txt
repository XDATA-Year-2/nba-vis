 THE FACT:  The Phoenix Suns are 10-2 playing with one day of rest.  
 
 THE LEAD:  The Golden State Warriors boast the NBA's most celebrated backcourt, but the Phoenix Suns' guard tandem might be just as good -- at least so far this season. The Suns'  Eric Bledsoe  and  Goran Dragic  went toe-to-toe with  Stephen Curry  and  Klay Thompson  with great effect as the Suns ran up consistent leads, then hung on to beat the visiting Warriors 106-102 Sunday night.  
 Currry-Thompson outscored Dragic-Bledsoe, 49-45, but the Suns' (14-9) guards were more efficient -- taking just 27 shots to 34 by the Warriors' (13-12) combo. The Suns win was their fifth straight. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We think our guards can play with any."  
 
 --Suns coach  Jeff Hornacek 
 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We're taking it a game at a time, figuring each other out."  
 
 --Eric Bledsoe said of his evolving relationship with fellow point guard Dragic 
 
 
 TURNING POINT:  A pair of 3-pointers, by Bledsoe with 3:52 left and  Channing Frye  with 3:20 left, opened the Suns' lead from 96-94 to 102-95.But after  P.J. Tucker  missed a fast-break layup, the Warriors managed to crawl back into contention in the closing seconds after Curry nailed a 3-pointer to make it 102-100 with 1:37 left. The game's clinching play came when the Warriors cleared out for Curry, who had the ball up top, hounded by Tucker, with fewer than 30 seconds left and the score still 102-100. With Tucker hanging close by, Curry missed an off-balance 18-footer.  
 
 QUOTABLE III: " You've got to press him, but still have enough room to recover if he decides to drive. You can't call what he's going to do. However you play defense, he'll do the opposite. In the end, "You don't go for the fake, and you hope he misses." 
 
 -- P.J. Tucker 
 
 
 QUOTABLE IV:  "We're trying to turn it around and put forth the effort and get us out of these substandard performances. We've got to change it." 
 
 -- Stephen Curry 
 
 
 QUOTABLE V:  "We've already won 14. We want to go up and be a playoff team."  
 
 -- Goran Dragic 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Suns' 3-point game was on target again as they hit 13-for-27 from long range. 
 
 HOT:  Dragic and Frye went a combined 7-for-9 on 3-pointers. 
 
 NOT:  The Warriors' reserves shot just 6-for-15 and were outscored by the Suns' bench, 28-18. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Over the past three games, Dragic has averaged 27.0 points while shooting 25-for-43 (58 percent), including 10-for-15 on 3-pointers. He is also the key to pushing the Suns' desired race-horse pace.  
 
 NOTABLE:  The Suns snapped a 6-game losing streak vs. the Warriors, the franchise's worst against the Warriors in the series that dates to 1968. All time, the Suns lead 135-86.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Warriors, Tuesday vs. Pelicans, Thursday vs. Spurs and Saturday vs. Lakers. For the Suns, Wednesday vs. Spurs, Friday @ Denver and Saturday vs. Mavericks.
