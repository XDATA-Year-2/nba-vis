  Magic-Mavs notebook   By Darrin Scheid, for NBA.com Posted Sunday January 9, 2011 12:00AM THE FACTS:  Orlando forward  Hedo Tukoglu  scored 13 points and dished out a career-high 17 assists, leading seven players in double-figures as the Orlando Magic beat the Dallas Mavericks 117-107 at the American Airlines Center. Orlando won for the ninth consecutive time to tie a franchise record. Dallas, playing without injured forward  Dirk Nowitzki , lost for the fifth time in seven games. Forward  DeShawn Stevenson  led the Mavericks with 24 points. QUOTABLE:  "Hedo was great tonight passing the ball. Seventeen assists for anybody is incredible, but a 6-10 forward with 17 assists, that's a phenomenal, phenomenal game. He made a lot of plays for us."   -- Magic head coach  Stan Van Gundy . THE STAT:  Orlando, which entered the game shooting 43 percent from the 3-point line during its win streak, started 2-for-11 and trailed, 50-34, with 3:30 left in the first half. When the Magic heated up from long range, the game changed. Orlando closed the half by hitting their final four from beyond the arc, and Magic guard  Jason Richardson  was fouled in the act of shooting another one. He hit all three free throws, and Orlando had cut a 16-point deficit to six, 57-51, by halftime. That run came with  Dwight Howard  on the bench most of the second quarter because of foul trouble. A 3-pointer by Magic guard  Gilbert Arenas  with a minute left in the third completed the comeback and put Orlando up, 80-79. The Magic was 12-for-21 from the 3-point line after the 2-for-11 start. TURNING POINT:  The Mavericks went on a 3-minute, 30-second scoring drought in the fourth quarter and watched an 88-87 deficit slip to 102-87 with 6:00 left. In that span, the Mavericks were 0-for-3 with three turnovers, an offensive foul and a technical foul on head coach  Rick Carlisle . HOT:  Orlando starting point guard  Jameer Nelson  and Arenas combined to go 10-for-21, 6-for-12 from the 3-point line, for 30 points. NOT:  The Dallas defense allowed a season-high 117 points, 51.9 percent shooting, and came one point away from allowing every Orlando player who saw action to finish in double-figures. Magic guard  J.J. Redick  was 2-for-7 from the field and was the lone single-digit man with nine points. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Howard had his 27th double-double with 23 points and 13 rebounds. He was 9-for-16 from the field and blocked two shots. BAD MOVE:  Dallas center  Tyson Chandler  picked up his sixth foul with his team trailing, 102-88, and desperately trying to rebound from a fourth-quarter cold spell. He then picked up a technical foul, and Orlando hit two of the three free throws to put the Mavericks down, 104-88, with 5:41 left in the game. ROOKIE WATCH:  Mavericks guard  Dominique Jones , getting more playing time because of injuries to Nowitzki and  Caron Butler , played nine minutes and finished with four points and two assists. NOTABLE:  Orlando's nine-game win streak in the longest current streak in the NBA...The Magic had at least six double-figure scorers for the seventh consecutive time...Orlando was 42-for-81 (51.9 percent) from the field, becoming just the second team to shoot at least 50 percent against the Mavericks this season. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Wednesday @ Pacers, Friday @ Spurs, Jan. 15 @ Memphis, For the Magic, Wednesday @ New Orleans, Thursday @ Oklahoma City, Jan. 15 @ Timberwolves.
