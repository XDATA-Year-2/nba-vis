  Notebook: Magic 117, Warriors 109   By Geoff Lepper, for NBA.com Posted Friday January 13, 2012 2:46AM THE FACTS:   Dwight Howard  set an all-time NBA record for free-throw attempts in a single game, making 39 trips to the line as the Orlando Magic outlasted the Golden State Warriors 117-109 Thursday. Howard converted 21 foul shots as part of a 45-point, 23-rebound, four-steal, three-assist, two-block night, tying his career high for points and setting a new personal best in free throws made. It was the first 40-20 game of Howard's illustrious career, just the third in Magic history, and allowed Orlando to go 3-0 on its Western road swing.  Monta Ellis  produced 30 points and 11 assists for the Warriors, and  David Lee  added a season-high 26 points and 12 rebounds for his sixth consecutive double-double. QUOTABLE:  "I just tried to be aggressive and get to the line. I didn't care if I missed 30. I was still going to go up there and shoot the next one with confidence."   -- Dwight Howard THE STAT:  With  Kwame Brown  lost to a torn pectoral muscle, and  Andris Biedrins  lasting just 21 minutes, Warriors coach  Mark Jackson  felt he had no other choice than to employ a system of deliberately fouling Howard, who came into the game shooting 42.6 percent from the line. The Warriors committed 36 fouls on the evening. Biedrins and Lee fouled out, while  Ekpe Udoh  and  Klay Thompson  each had five fouls. Howard improved markedly as the game went on, going from 3-for-8 in the first quarter to 8-for-11 in the fourth. "It is amazing," Magic guard  J.J. Redick  joked. "It's amazing that he made 21." TURNING POINT:  Howard's three-point play had given Orlando a 112-109 lead with 1:05 remaining, but it was Von Wafer who delivered the kill shot, draining a 3-pointer from the right corner to put the Magic up 6 with 36.9 seconds remaining. QUOTABLE II:  "I can understand people thinking, 'Why?' but don't get caught up in the free throws. Think about when we didn't foul him. It was dunks, hooks, at the rim. He's a great player. And he's a bad free throw shooter. Giving ourselves the best chance possible, we tried to mess up their rhythm, take their 3-point shooters out of it, which we did. They made plays."   -- Warriors coach Mark Jackson FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Magic forward  Hedo Turkoglu  drew praise prior to the game from coach  Stan Van Gundy  and continued his run with 20 points and a team-high nine assists. HOT:  While Howard was missing 18 free throws, the rest of his team went 15-for-16 from the stripe. Turkoglu had the only non-Howard miss for Orlando. ROOKIE WATCH:  Warriors swingman Klay Thompson was notable mostly in the first half for being one of the sacrificial lambs in Jackson's fouling plan. But he rebounded with 11 points in the second half to finish with 14 total, including 4-for-5 3-pointers. NOTABLE:  Howard broke  Wilt Chamberlain 's record for free throws in a single game. Chamberlain had 34 attempts for the Philadelphia Warriors against the St. Louis Hawks on Feb. 22, 1962. . . . Howard's performance was the league's first 40-20 game since  Shaquille O'Neal  hung 48 and 20 for the Lakers against Boston on March 21, 2003. It was the first 40-20 game by an Orlando player since O'Neal put up 46 and 20 for the Magic against Charlotte on Nov. 9, 1994, and the first 40-20 against the Warriors since  Patrick Ewing  posted 44 and 24 for the Knicks on Nov. 24, 1989. . . . Orlando guard  Jason Richardson  left the game with 8:46 remaining in the third quarter after colliding with Lee. Richardson was diagnosed with a sprained left knee and did not return. . . . The Warriors played without forward  Dorell Wright , who suffered a left knee contusion when he banged knees with  Dwyane Wade  against Miami on Tuesday. Wright is considered day-to-day, but told NBA.com he's hopeful he can go Saturday in Charlotte. . . .  Brandon Rush  started in place of Wright and had 12 points and three assists. . . . Ellis had his seventh career 30-10 game. . . . Orlando forward  Quentin Richardson  sat out with a sprained left ankle. UP NEXT:  For the Warriors, Saturday @ Charlotte, Sunday @ Detroit, Tuesday @ Cleveland. For the Magic, Monday @ New York, Tuesday vs. Charlotte, Wednesday vs. San Antonio.
