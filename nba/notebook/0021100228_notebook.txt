  Notebook: Nuggets 119, Knicks 114   By Adam Zagoria, for NBA.com Posted Saturday January 21, 2012 11:46PM THE FACTS:  Playing against his former team for the first time since he was dealt in the  Carmelo Anthony  trade last February,  Danilo Gallinari  scored a career-high 37 points and grabbed 11 rebounds as the Denver Nuggets won their fourth straight road game, 119-114 in double-overtime, over the Knicks at Madison Square Garden. The Knicks have now dropped six straight. Three former Knicks combined for 77 points, highlighted by Gallinari, who went 18-for-20 from the line. Al Harrington , who left New York as a free agent in 2010, scored 22 of his 24 points in the second half and the overtime periods, including a key 3-pointer with 1:05 left in the second OT to make it 115-11. Timofey Mozgov , one of four key Knicks dealt for Anthony, added a career-high 16 points on 6-for-11 shooting. Anthony hit a fadeaway jumper with 1.7 seconds left in regulation to force the first overtime and finished with 25 points on 10-for-30 shooting to go with 10 rebounds. QUOTABLE:  "It was great. I want to thank all the New York fans for the ovation they gave me."    --   Gallinari on getting cheered when he was introduced. THE STAT:  Gallinari scored nine points in the second overtime -- going 7-for-7 from the foul line -- as the Nuggets outscored the Knicks 14-9. QUOTABLE II:  " Six straight is never easy. It's never easy losing six straight."    --  Amar'e Stoudemire TURNING POINT:  After Anthony put the Knicks up 111-110 in the second OT, the Nuggets went on a 7-0 run -- highlighted by Harrington's fourth 3-pointer and three foul shots from Ty Lawson -- to push it to 117-110. WHO'S HOT:  Knicks wing  Billy Walker  went for a season-high 15 to give a big boost off the bench. The Knicks bench has struggled for much of the season. En route to 13 first-half points, Walker was 5-for-5, including 3-for-3 from beyond the arc. WHO'S NOT:  Stoudemire continues to struggle for the Knicks, scoring 12 points on 4-for-9 shooting with 11 rebounds. QUOTABLE III:  "I don't know. They don't pay me to make those assumptions or to figure those things out. I hope it work out for them, though, because I hate to see anybody suffer, especially in New York you can suffer if you don't win."    -- Harrington on the Knicks NOTABLE:  D'Antoni said point guard  Baron Davis  could possibly return next week during the team's four-game road trip. "It's hard to say, 'Yeah, he'll be ready a week from today,'' D'Antoni said pre-game. "But he's getting closer." NOTABLE II:  Karl and Anthony spoke briefly before the game and the Nuggets coach said he wishes his former star the best. "Melo's a good person," Karl said. "He's a good person. I think we had many good moments. I'm proud to say I was one of his coaches and hopefully he feels I helped him get to a higher level because I coached him." INSIDE THE ARENA:  Former Mets catcher  Mike Piazza  was in the house and predicted that the Giants would beat the 49ers, 21-17, in Sunday's NFC Championship Game.
