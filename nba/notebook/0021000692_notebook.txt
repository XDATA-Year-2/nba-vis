  Kings-Lakers notebook   By Bryan Chu, for NBA.com Posted Saturday January 29, 2011 2:33AM THE FACTS:  Before the game, Lakers coach  Phil Jackson  said co-captain  Derek Fisher  spoke to the team about not thinking about their rematch of last year's NBA Finals against the Celtics Sunday. Fisher didn't want the Lakers to overlook the Kings, who came in with the third worst record in the NBA. They did, however. Behind a spirited effort by a Sacramento rookie and a lights-out shooting performance in the third quarter, the Kings outlasted the Lakers 100-95 Friday at Staples Center. The Kings (11-33) led by as many as 20 points in the contest. They snapped an eight-game losing streak to Los Angeles with rookie  DeMarcus Cousins  cobbling a game-high 27 points and 10 rebounds.  Omri Casspi  tallied 20 points and  Carl Landry  had 12 and 10. Only three Lakers (33-14) finished in double figures as they shot 41.3 percent in the loss.  Kobe Bryant , who surpassed  Hakeem Olajuwon  (26,946 points) for eighth on the NBA's all-time scoring list, posted a game-high 38 points.  Shannon Brown  collected 17 points and  Andrew Bynum  chipped in with 12. Oddly enough, the Celtics lost by 17 points to the Suns the same night. Bryant weighed in on if the team overlooked the Sacramento with Boston coming into town Sunday. "I don't know, I don't think so," he said. "Maybe a little bit, but I doubt it." In the first half, neither team played defense as they were content with just trading baskets. Sacramento shot 59.1 percent to the Lakers 52.6 percent from the field in the first half. The Lakers trailed 85-71 heading in the fourth quarter, but trimmed it to 93-90 with 2:43 to go after  Pau Gasol  split a pair of free throws. That was the closest the Lakers would get as  Tyreke Evans , who had 13 points, converted a pair of free throws and Casspi had a tip-in. The Kings did shoot 23.5 (4-for-17) percent in the final quarter and made just 6-for-10 from the charity stripe as they limped to the finish line. QUOTABLE:  "I feel like I won the championship."   -- DeMarcus Cousins. THE STAT:  3 -- The most number of points a Laker scored in the third quarter ( Steve Blake  and Brown). TURNING POINT:  To start the third quarter, Kings coach  Paul Westphal  opted to start a bigger lineup with  Samuel Dalembert  guarding Gasol. It paid off. The Kings went on a 22-6 run to go up 81-61 in large part because they couldn't miss, sinking 10-for-12 from the field to start the period. For the quarter, Sacramento shot 57.1 percent from the field. Dalembert went 5-for-5 shooting for 10 of his season-high 18 points. The Kings outscored the Lakers 26-16 in the third period. QUOTABLE II:  "We had poor purpose. I think we were forcing the ball. Perhaps, Kobe carried so much of the load in the first half that everyone else was kind of sitting back on their heels and looking for him the whole game."   -- Phil Jackson on the loss. HOT:  Bryant grabbed his left shoulder after Evans drove straight into it at the 10:26 mark of the first quarter. That brief play got Bryant going. Bryant dropped 21 of his 38 points in the first quarter on 8-for-11 shooting. He also had three steals in the period. Bryant did cool off, but he still finished the game 13-for-27 shooting. He also had seven assists. NOT:  Lakers forward  Lamar Odom , who had four points and eight rebounds, did not convert a single field goal in the game, missing all seven of his attempts in 29:47 of play. That was the first time he laid a goose egg since Dec. 12, 2006, which he only played three minutes because he went out with a sprained knee. Besides that game, the last time Odom failed to convert a field goal was back on Mar. 27, 2003 when he went 0-for-7 against these same Kings in Sacramento. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Since being inserted in the starting lineup for the last four games, Casspi has produced. He is averaging 13 points per game on 48.8 percent shooting. Casspi is grabbing eight rebounds per game. He has also made seven 3-pointers during that stretch. QUOTABLE III:  "This is a great, great win. This is my first time winning in LA."   -- Omri Casspi on the victory. ROOKIE WATCH:  Cousins got off to quick start, scoring 12 points on 6-for-7 shooting in the first quarter. He showed off his touch from outside drilling 19-footers with ease. Cousins finished with 27 points on 11-for-19 shooting in what has been a breakout new year for him. In the month of January, Cousins has scored 20 or more points six times after only doing it twice in the previous three months. NOTABLE:  The Sacramento frontline (Cousins, Landry, Dalembert) outplayed the Lakers trio (Gasol, Bynum, Odom) offensively, outscoring them 57-25. ... Bryant had a pair of 3-pointers that went in-and-out in the game's final minute. ... The Kings outscored the Lakers in the paint, 50-36. ... There were 20 lead changes and 11 ties. UP NEXT:  For the Lakers, Sunday vs. Celtics, Tuesday vs. Houston, Thursday vs. San Antonio. For the Kings, Saturday vs. New Orleans, Tuesday vs. Boston, Saturday vs. San Antonio.
