 THE FACT:  With 12 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists,  Lance Stephenson  recorded his third triple-double of the young season. No other NBA player has more than one. He's the first Pacers player with three in a season since  Detlef Schrempf  had four in 1992-93. 
 
 THE LEAD: Paul George  scored 18 of his game-high 24 points in the third quarter, when the Pacers blew open the game on their way to a second consecutive laugher, 106-79 over the visiting Boston Celtics before a sellout crowd of 18,615 Sunday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. George hit all six of his shots in the period as the Pacers (22-5) quickly pushed a 15-point halftime lead to 26 and coasted home.  Roy Hibbert  had 15 points and 12 rebounds and  Danny Granger , in his second game of the season, had 12 points and hit four 3-pointers in 25 minutes off the bench.  Avery Bradley  led the Celtics (12-17) with 13. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "Roy had it going early, Paul George in the third quarter offensively really made it look easy. He just has certain spurts that are very, very impressive. And Lance obviously with a triple-double, a major contribution to the victory but our third quarter defense was probably the biggest factor."  --  Indiana coach  Frank Vogel 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Pacers now have 12 victories by double-digit margins, five by at least 20. In consecutive victories over the Celtics and Rockets, they piled up a combined margin of 60 points.   
 
 TURNING POINT:  With the game tied 23-all early in the second quarter, Indiana's second unit provided a much-needed lift, putting together a 15-1 run helped along by a pair of 3-pointers from Granger, while the Celtics missed all five of their shots. The Pacers led by double figures the rest of the night. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It felt good. I was so tired, I wanted to come out. I told coach, 'Get me out if I miss this.' I'm just happy I got the shot and happy we got the win."  --  Stephenson on the fourth-quarter 3-pointer that completed his triple-double 
 
 
 HOT : George shot 9-for-13 and Hibbert 7-for-11 for Indiana. ... The Pacers shot 9-for-19 from the 3-point line. 
 
 NOT:  Boston's starting frontcourt of  Jared Sullinger  and  Brandon Bass  combined for 12 points on 5-for-18 shooting. ...  Kelly Olynyk  shot 3-for-10 off the Boston bench. ... Stephenson struggled through a 5-for-15 shooting night. 
 
 QUOTABLE III : "Adding Granger is scary ... I think the more he gets comfortable the better they'll be."  --  Boston coach  Brad Stevens 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Four Pacers players have combined to produce seven triple-doubles since the start of the 2012-13 season (Stephenson three, George two, Hibbert and  David West  one each). ...  Jeff Green  and  Courtney Lee  scored 11 apiece for the Celtics. ... The Pacers held a 50-22 advantage in points in the paint. ... Granger's four 3-pointers are his most in a game since the 2011-12 season. ... The pacers are 6-0 against the Atlantic Division. ... The loss spoiled the Indianapolis homecoming of Celtics coach Stevens, formerly of Butler University. Stevens is 0-2 against the Pacers this season by a combined margin of 42 points. ... George had a four-point play in the third quarter. ... The double-double was Hibbert's ninth of the season. ... Boston has lost three in a row, allowing an average of 106.3 points in the process. .... Butler athletic director  Barry Collier  and basketball coach  Brandon Miller , Stevens' successor, were in attendance, as was Ball State football coach  Pete Lembo ...Boston's 79 points was its second-lowest output of the season. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Pacers, Monday @ Brooklyn, Saturday vs. Brooklyn, Dec. 31 vs. Cleveland. For the Celtics, Saturday vs. Cleveland, Dec. 31 vs. Atlanta, Jan. 2 @ Chicago.
