 THE FACTS:   Carmelo Anthon y set a franchise record with his 30th straight 20-point game by going for exactly 20 points along with seven rebounds and five assists as the Knicks beat the Orlando Magic, 113-97, at Madison Square Garden. 
 Anthony broke  Richie Guerin's  previous record of 29 straight 20-point games. 
 
 Tyson Chandler  led New York with 21 points and seven rebounds,  Raymond Felton  added 15 points, nine assists and zero turnovers and  Amar'e Stoudemire  tallied 14 points for the Atlantic Division-leading Knicks (28-15), who are now 16-6 at home. 
 
 J.R. Smith  and  Pablo Prigioni  had 11 points apiece for the Knicks, who won their second straight and improved to 3-0 against Orlando. 
 Orlando (14-31) lost its seventh straight and fell to 2-18 in its last 20 games. 
 
 J.J. Redick  led the Magic with 29 points, two shy of his career-high, and  Jameer Nelson  tallied 21.  Nikola Vucevic  added 12 points and 11 boards. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I mean first of all I gotta take my hat off to my teammates for putting me in a position to be able to do this. The ball been finding me and we been playing well. I definitely gotta give this to my teammates." 
  -- Anthony in his on-court interview . 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Knicks shot 14-of-34 from deep, led by Felton and Prigioni, who were each 3-of-6. The Magic went 7-of-26 from beyond the arc, with Nelson going 2-of-7 and  Hedo Turkoglu  going 0-of-4 en route to two points. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  After allowing Redick and Nelson to combine for 26 points in the first quarter and 36 in the first half, the Knicks tightened up their defense somewhat and allowed them just nine points in the third. That helped the Knicks turn a 51-all halftime tie into a 78-73 lead after three.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We just had to make some adjustments...We made our adjustments and we turned the game around." 
  -- Anthony on the second half, when the Knicks outscored the Magic, 62-46. 
 
 
 WHO'S HOT:  Chandler went 10-of-11 from the field and was +17, while Stoudemire was 7-of-7 for a +3. 
 
 WHO'S NOT:  The Magic starting forward tandem of  Glen Davis  and  Moe Harkless  combined for eight points and three rebounds.  
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "Melo is an MVP candidate. I don't care how you slice it." 
  -- Knicks coach  Mike Woodson 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Jason Kidd  (sore lower back) sat for the Knicks after playing just five minutes ? and none in the second half ? in Sunday's win over Atlanta."Just getting some treatment, a little sore today," Woodson said. "We'll see how he feels [Thursday] and he'll probably play Friday." 
 
 NOTABLE II:  In Kidd's absence, Prigioni, the 35-year-old rookie, played very well for the Knicks as the backup point guard, going for 11 points and two assists. 
 
 QUOTABLE IV:  "Pablo's not gonna play 30 minutes a game, but the minutes that he plays I expect him to defend." 
 -- Woodson 
 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:   Howard Stern  sat courtside. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Knicks, Friday vs. Milwaukee, Saturday vs. Sacramento, Monday vs. Detroit. For the Magic, Friday at Boston, Saturday at Milwaukee, Monday at Philadelphia.
