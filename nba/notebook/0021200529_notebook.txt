 THE FACTS: Wesley Matthews ' back-to-back 3-pointers in the final minute lifted Portland to a come-from-behind 92-90 victory over Miami Thursday night at the Rose Garden. It was the 12th win in 15 games and the ninth straight home victory for Portland (20-15), which trailed by 12 points early in the fourth quarter before mounting the rally that had the Garden noise level at its highest crescendo at game's end. 
 
 Nicolas Batum  collected 28 points, seven rebounds and five assists for the Blazers, who also got 20 points and 15 boards from  LaMarcus Aldridge . 
 
 Chris Bosh  scored 29 points and  LeBron James  had 15 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists for Miami (23-11), which lost for the fifth time in its last eight games. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "If I didn't shoot with confidence, they probably weren't going in. That's how this game works. You believe, you play hard, you compete, you play the right way, you play with confidence, and the basketball gods will look out for you." 
 -- Wesley Matthews 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Portland won despite shooting only .375 from the field. Only once this season have the Blazers shot that poorly and won -- .359 in a 101-93 win over Denver on Dec. 20. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Miami led 80-68 with eight minutes remaining, then made only three baskets the rest of the way as the Blazers outscored the Heat 24-10 down the stretch. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We did everything we could, and they made big shots at the end. We gave ourselves a chance to win and we had it, but they took it from us at the end."  
 -- Miami's  Dwyane Wade 
 
 
 HOT:  Bosh had one of his best shooting games of the season, stepping outside often while hitting 13-for-18 from the field. 
 
 NOT:  Other than Batum (8-for-15), the Blazers shot a collective 22-for-65 (.338). 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Portland coach  Terry Stotts  using 6-foot-5 Wesley Matthews on 6-foot-8 LeBron James.  
 
 BAD MOVE:  James didn't attempt to post up Matthews one time in the game. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "He made him work. LeBron's a great player. He almost had a triple double and we did a good job on him. Wes didn't give him alleys to the basket. [James] got four of his points in transition early in the game. [Matthews] did a nice job of taking away angles and forcing him to be a passer and keeping him away from the rim." 
 -- Terry Stotts 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  James' streak of scoring 20 or more points -- dating to last season, including playoffs -- ended at 54 games. He finished 6-for-16 from the field and scored only three points in the second half. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Heat, Saturday @ Sacramento, Monday @ Utah, Wednesday at Golden State. For the Trail Blazers, Friday @ Golden State, Sunday vs. Oklahoma City, Tuesday at Denver.
