 THE FACTS:  With the season winding down, the starters for Memphis looked sluggish against Charlotte for three quarters. Coach  Lionel Hollins  turned to his reserves in the fourth quarter and they responded by outscoring the Bobcats, 31-18, to lead the Grizzlies to a 94-75 victory at FedExForum. Point guard  Mike Conley  had a game-high 20 points and seven assists. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "That's what our job is coming off the bench, just to stay ready and provide energy. We came out and really did that. We had great energy, shared the ball and we were getting good stops. It's fun to play when you're sharing the ball and everybody is aggressive and playing at a high level." 
 -- Grizzlies reserve forward  Jon Leuer , who led the bench players with 11 points. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Grizzlies have now won 13 straight home games, the second-longest in franchise history. Their longest such streak is 15 games, which spanned two seasons from March 18 to Nov. 16, 2012. The Grizzlies last loss at home was Feb. 5 against Phoenix. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  A  Jannero Pargo  3-pointer to start the fourth quarter pulled Charlotte within 63-60. But the Grizzlies bench, led by  Austin Daye ,  Jon Leuer ,  Ed Davis  and  Quincy Pondexter , sparked the team on both ends of the floor as they went on a 15-0 run that broke the game open. The Bobcats went scoreless for four minutes. 
 
 HOT : Leuer took advantage of his extended minutes. In 12 minutes, Leuer had his highest scoring game as a Grizzly, scoring 11 points on 4 for 4 from the floor. He also added five rebounds and two assists. 
 
 NOT:  The Grizzlies' big men,  Zach Randolph  and  Marc Gasol , didn't dominate the way you would expect against  Josh McRoberts  and  Bismack Biyombo . Randolph had 11 points on 5 of 12 shooting, while Gasol was 4 for 11, finishing with eight points. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I just like the fact our guys are holding onto the rope and playing a good brand of basketball. We just have to do a good job of coming down the back stretch and that's kind of been the issue all along. We're addressing it with the different playing combinations. But a lot of credit goes to the guys in the locker room coming in and playing this brand of basketball." 
  -- Charlotte coach  Mike Dunlap 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Conley has become the Grizzlies main scoring threat as of late. He has now led the team in scoring in 10 of their last 13 games. In the first 65 games of the season, Conley led the team in scoring just seven times. Tuesday's performance also marked his career-high fifth straight game with 20 or more points. ... Charlotte was held to just 75 points while shooting .375 from the floor. ... While improving to 31-8 at home this season, the Grizzlies have tied their single season record for most home victories in a season. They were 31-10 during the 2003-04 season, their final year at The Pyramid. ... The Grizzlies rounded out the Eastern Conference portion of their schedule, finishing with a 22-8 record. ... The Bobcats have lost 13 straight road games, the second-longest road losing streak by any team this season. ... The loss gives Charlotte (18-60) its second 60-loss season in franchise history. The Bobcats were 18-64 in their inaugural season of 2004-05. ...  Kemba Walker  led the Bobcats with 19 points, nine of those coming in the third quarter when the Bobcats opened with a 13-4 run to tie the game at 53. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Bobcats, Friday at Detroit, Saturday vs. Milwaukee, Monday vs. New York. For the Grizzlies, Friday at Houston, Saturday vs. L.A. Clippers, Monday at Dallas.
