  Notebook: Thunder 108, Spurs 96   By Randy Renner, for NBA.com Posted Sunday January 8, 2012 10:42PM THE FACTS:  Playing their third game in as many nights, the Oklahoma City Thunder looked anything but tired in blowing past the San Antonio Spurs 108-96 for their eighth win in 10 games this season. The Thunder led by as many as 25 points and by 23 with just 3:30 left in the game. OKC becomes the first team in the NBA this season to take all three games in a back-to-back-to-back set. The Thunder beat Houston both Friday and Saturday nights. The starters for both teams sat out the fourth quarter as both coaches emptied their benches.  Kevin Durant  led all scorers with 21 points on 5-for-9 shooting. Durant also pulled down 10 rebounds and handed out seven assists.  James Harden  added 20 off the bench.  Nick Collison  had a double-double with 12 points on 6-for-7 shooting while grabbing 10 rebounds. San Antonio, coming off a 121-117 win Saturday night against Denver and playing their fourth game in five nights, couldn't muster much offense against the Thunder.  Tony Parker  and  Tim Duncan  combined for only 15 points on 6-for-21 shooting. The Spurs were led by  Gary Neal  with 18 points on 7-for-12 shooting. As a team though, San Antonio shot just 41.7 percent while allowing the Thunder to shoot 50.7 percent. QUOTABLE:  "I thought we had good energy, the defense was really good, we were getting out in transition on offense, but I thought our guys really brought it tonight on defense."   --Thunder Head Coach  Scott Brooks THE STAT:  In the third quarter OKC outscored San Antonio 37-21. The Thunder shot 70.6% (12-for-17) and held the Spurs to 38.9% (7-for-18). The Thunder also out-rebounded the Spurs in the third quarter 13-4, out-scored them 13-0 on the break and 12-4 in the paint. TURNING POINT:  Oklahoma City's defense led to big offensive numbers in the third quarter and turned a close game into a rout. After a Parker steal and a  Richard Jefferson  3-pointer at the start of the third pulled to the Spurs to within 54-51 Oklahoma City went on an 11-3 run. The Spurs shot just 38.9 percent in the quarter and Oklahoma City fired away at a 71 percent clip. As the quarter ended that 54-51 Thunder lead had ballooned out to 24 points (91-67), and it was cruise control after that. QUOTABLE II:  "They played very well and they kicked our butts in the third quarter. They did a great job."   --Spurs Head Coach  Gregg Popovich QUOTABLE III:  "We weren't concerned with the three games (in three nights) we were concerned about each game on each night."   -- Brooks HOT:  The Spurs hit five of their first eight shots (62.5 percent). ...Thunder guard Thabo Sefolosha was 3-for-3 including 2-for-2 on 3-pointers in the first 12 minutes. ...Oklahoma City's  Nick Collison  (5-for-6) and  James Harden  (4-for-5) were a combined 9-for-11 (24 points) in the first 15 minutes of the game. ... The Thunder hit four of their first five shots in the third quarter...Oklahoma City was shooting 56.1% through three quarters. ...OKC shot 70.6 percent in the third quarter...Kevin Durant,  Serge Ibaka , Harden and  Reggie Jackson  combined to go 8-for-8 in the third... NOT:  After the Spurs hit five of their first eight shots they missed 11 of their next 14 and finished the quarter at 36.4 percent ...OKC's  Russell Westbrook  was 1-for-5 in the first quarter and 0-for-2 in the second...San Antonio's was 1-for-6 in the first half and finished 1-for-8 (4 points). QUOTABLE IV:  "You just have to think about the next one. There are so many games and you cannot worry about one loss too long. It happens. We just have to focus on the next game."   --Spurs guard Parker INSIDE THE ARENA:  Another sellout crowd (18,203) inside Chesapeake Energy Arena. Oklahoma City has sold out 41 of its last 47 games and 20 straight regular season games. GOOD MOVE:  Late in the first quarter, Harden took a skip step then went around both  Danny Green  at the free throw line and then  Tiago Splitter  in the lane to get the layup. BAD MOVE:  Spurs guard Green lost his dribble in the second quarter and stepped away from the ball, Harden picked it up and raced down court for an uncontested slam. NOTABLE:  Thunder coaches and management have been knocking on wood the last couple of years because Oklahoma City has not had a player suffer a serious injury. That changed Saturday night in Houston when back-up point guard  Eric Maynor  tore the ACL in his right knee. Maynor will undergo surgery soon and will be lost for the rest of the season. ...Oklahoma City's Ibaka blocked three shots. He now has blocked at least one shot in his last 23 regular season games. ... Kendrick Perkins  also had a block, Perkins and Ibaka have blocked at least one shot in all ten Thunder games. OKC is the only team in the NBA with such a combo. UP NEXT:  For the Spurs, Tuesday @ Milwaukee, Wednesday vs Rockets, Friday vs Trail Blazers. For the Thunder, Tuesday @ Memphis, Wednesday @ New Orleans, Saturday vs Knicks.
