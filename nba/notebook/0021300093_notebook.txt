 THE FACT : The Portland Trail Blazers led by as many as 22 points tonight and completed the back-to-back sweep of the Sacramento Kings despite a 1-for-15 shooting night from leading scorer  Damian Lillard . 
 
 THE LEAD:  The Trail Blazers (4-2) picked up their second win against the Sacramento Kings (1-5) in as many nights, beating the home team by a final of 96-85. 
 Sacramento cut the lead to seven in the final three minutes, but couldn't complete the comeback against a deep Portland team. 
 The Blazers went to All-Star forward  LaMarcus Aldridge  early and often and the big man responded with a big 22-point, 14-rebound performance.   Wesley Matthews  added 21 points for Portland as they improved to 4-2 on the season. 
 After scoring 35 points last night at the Moda Center,  DeMarcus Cousins  backed it up tonight with a big 33-point, 12-rebound game.  Rookie  Ben McLemore  came off the bench to score 13 for the Kings and  Isaiah Thomas  added 12 in the loss.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I'm not going to go shoot a thousand jumpers because I went 1-for-15.  It's not going to happen too often, I know that."   --  Lillard on his rough night shooting. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Trail Blazers killed the Kings on the glass, winning the rebound battle 52-33.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  Portland pulled away in the third quarter, outscoring the Kings 24-16 and taking a 69-54 lead into the fourth.  The Kings battled back, but never got closer than seven. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I'm just playing basketball.  Taking what the game is giving me.  I'm not forcing anything, I'm not rushing anything."  --  Matthews . 
 
 
 HOT:  Matthews could do no wrong tonight for Portland.  The veteran shooting guard scored 19 points on 7-for-10 shooting in the win.  Matthews is now shooting 56.5 percent from the field and 53.3 percent from the field in the Blazers first six games. 
 
 HOT II:  Cousins got it going in the second half, scoring 25 of his 33 points after the intermission.   
 
 NOT:  It's a good thing Portland didn't need their leading scorer tonight.  Lillard finished the night with four points. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Former first round pick  Jimmer Fredette  played for just the second time this season, finishing with four points in 19 minutes.   
 
 NOTABLE II : The Sacramento Kings have now lost five in a row after winning their season opener against the Denver Nuggets. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Portland, Monday vs. Detroit, Wednesday vs. Phoenix, Friday @ Boston. For the Kings, Wednesday vs. Brooklyn, Friday vs. Pistons, Sunday vs. Memphis.
