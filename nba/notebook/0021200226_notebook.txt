 THE FACTS :  J.R. Smith  put up 20 points and six assists off the bench and  Carmelo Anthony  also added 20 points as the Knicks won their second straight, 108-87 over the Washington Wizards Friday night at Madison Square Garden. 
 The Knicks (11-4) improved to 6-0 at home to start a season for the first time since 1992-93, when they won 60 games. 
 
 Tyson Chandler  added a double-double of 12 points and 10 rebounds,  Ronnie Brewer  had 12 points and  Raymond Felton  scored 11. 
 For the Wizards (1-13),  Jordan Crawford  had 17 points off the bench,  Bradley Beal  added 14 and  Kevin Seraphin  scored 13. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "It's easier when you shoot in front of a crowd like this."  
 -- J.R. Smith on MSG 
 
 THE STAT : The Knicks went 12-for-29 from beyond the arc, highlighted by  Steve Novak 's 3-for-6 effort.  
 
 TURNING POINT : Once again, the Knicks got out to an early lead at home, seizing a 26-17 first-quarter advantage and 57-46 halftime edge. Anthony had 12 points at the break and Smith tallied 10.  
 
 QUOTABLE II : "Every time you look up, this guy has 20 points."  
 -- Walt "Clyde" Frazier on Anthony 
 
 WHO'S HOT :  Pablo Prigioni  continues to be a sparkplug off the bench for the Knicks. He tallied eight points and five assists one game after putting up 11 points and seven assists in Wednesday's win in Milwaukee. 
 
 WHO'S NOT : The Wizards. They snapped their one-game winning streak with their 12th loss in 13 outings this season. 
 
 QUOTABLE III : "I want Raymond [Felton] to score the ball but Pablo [Prigioni], he's a pass-first guy, so all the players love that."  
 -- Knicks coach  Mike Woodson 
 
 
 NOTABLE : Woodson declined comment on the NBA's decision to fine the San Antonio Spurs $250,000 for sitting four of their five leading scorers in Thursday's Miami Heat game. "That's Pop and his team, and I gotta deal with our team," Woodson said. 
 
 NOTABLE II :  Jason Kidd  (back spasms) missed his third straight game. He said at shootaround he's targeting next week's three-game road trip, beginning Wednesday in Charlotte, for his return.  "I hope so,'' Kidd said. "That's the plan -- to get me back out there sometime next week. I feel great -- a lot better as the week's gone on. That's the goal is to be 100 percent when you come back. No need to rush. Today was a great day working out. We'll see how I feel tomorrow." 
 
 QUOTABLE IV : "Now that I'm here in in New York, you're talking about trying to win the division, you can't lose at home."  
 -- Mike Woodson 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA : Vince Vaughn was on hand, shooting a movie that filmed a scene between a fake Knicks team and a fake Wizards squad. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Knicks, Wednesday @ Charlotte, Thursday @ Miami, Saturday @ Chicago. For the Wizards, Tuesday vs. Miami, Friday @ Atlanta, Saturday vs. Golden State.
