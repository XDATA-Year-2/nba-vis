  Mavs-Knicks notebook   By Adam Zagoria, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday February 2, 2011 10:23PM THE FACTS:   Dirk Nowitzki  scored 29 points and became the 24th player to surpass the 22,000-point plateau and  Jose Barea  added 22 points off the bench as the Dallas Mavericks won their sixth straight 113-97 over the Knicks at Madison Square Garden. QUOTABLE:  "There's a guy who's worked more on developing his game [than anybody] in the history of the league. There's a reason the ball goes in the basket. He's put in the work."   -- Mavs coach  Rick Carlisle  on Dirk Nowitzki THE STAT:  The Mavs dominated on the boards (54-34) and from beyond the arc. Dallas shot 11-for-25 (44 percent) from deep while the Knicks made 6 of 23 (26 percent). TURNING POINT:  After taking a narrow 56-52 halftime lead, the Mavs outscored the Knicks 30-21 in the third period to seize an 86-73 lead. QUOTABLE II:  "They're an older, more experienced team and they ran harder than we did."    -- Knicks coach  Mike D'Antoni HOT:  Nowitzki has notched 20 or more points in three straight games and four of six. NOT:  After putting up career-highs of 24 points and 13 boards in Sunday's win over the Detroit Pistons, Knicks rookie center  Timofey Mozgov  came back to Earth with four points and one rebound. NOTABLE:   Amar'e Stoudemire  scored 21 points in the first half but failed to score in the second. INSIDE THE ARENA:   Justin Bieber  wore purple framed glasses and received a massive round of boos.  Chris Rock  was also in the house. UP NEXT:  For the Knicks, Friday @ Philadelphia, Sunday vs. Philadelphia, Wednesday vs. Clippers. For the Mavericks, Friday @ Boston, Saturday @ Charlotte, Monday vs. Cleveland.
