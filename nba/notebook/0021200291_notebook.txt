 THE FACTS : Sacramento broke open a tight game early in the third quarter and never looked back en route to a 99-80 victory over Portland Saturday night at the Rose Garden.  DeMarcus Cousins  collected 19 points and 12 rebounds and  John Salmons  contributed season highs in points (19) and assists (11) for the Kings (7-12), who won their third straight game and avenged a 93-76 setback to the Trail Blazers Nov. 23 at Sacramento.  LaMarcus Aldridge  had 17 points and 10 rebounds and  J.J. Hickson  added 14 points and 15 boards for Portland (8-12), which was beginning a six-game homestand following a seven-game road trip. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "Coming off of two home wins, to go on the road and get that third win -- it feels good. Hopefully we can continue doing it."  
 -- John Salmons 
 
 THE STAT : Portland committed 19 turnovers -- nine in the first quarter -- that led to the Kings scoring a whopping 30 points. 
 
 TURNING POINT : Sacramento started the third quarter on a 14-6 run that increased a 43-41 halftime lead to 57-47. The margin was 12 at 77-65 after three quarters, and the Blazers never cut the deficit inside single digits the rest of the way. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "Sacramento played harder and better than we did. We were out of sorts offensively all night, whether turnovers or finishing at the rim or spacing. It was just a rough night at both ends."  
 -- Portland coach  Terry Stotts  
 
 
 HOT : Former Blazers' player  Travis Outlaw  had scored only 19 points in five games for Sacramento. The veteran small forward entered the game in the third quarter and matched a season-high with 11 points on 5-for-7 shooting in 17 minutes. 
 
 NOT : Batum went 1-for-5 from the field. It was the 10th straight game Portland's starting small forward has failed to shoot 50 percent from the field. He is 33-for-100 over that stretch.   
 
 GOOD MOVE : The Kings pounded the ball inside to Cousins and drove on the middle often with their perimeter players. They had a huge edge in points in the paint (36-22) and second-chance points (25-10). 
 
 BAD MOVE :  Nicolas Batum  bravely tried to play through a back injury, but re-injured it on a drive to the basket in the third quarter and departed with five points and two rebounds in 17 minutes. 
 
 QUOTABLE III : "We hope they're OK. We don't need those two guys out for any stretch of time. We don't want there to be anything serious wrong with them."  
 -- LaMarcus Aldridge on injuries to teammates Nicolas Batum and  Wesley Matthews 
 
 
 NOTABLE : The victory was only Sacramento's 18th in 94 visits to Portland dating to 1970 when the Kings were in Kansas City. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Kings, Monday @ Dallas, Wednesday @ Milwaukee, Friday @ Oklahoma City. For the Trail Blazers, Monday vs. Toronto, Thursday vs. San Antonio, Sunday vs. New Orleans.
