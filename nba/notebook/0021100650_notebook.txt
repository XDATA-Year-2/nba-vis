  Notebook: Suns 109, Pistons 101 Posted Saturday March 17, 2012 1:40AM By Mike Tulumello, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  For more than two months, the Phoenix Suns have been struggling to reach the .500 level. They finally did it on Friday night in Arizona. They pulled out a hair-raising 109-101 win over the Detroit Pistons, a team that's also quietly been playing some of the the NBA's best basketball in recent weeks. By winning their 10th game in the last 13 -- and third in three nights -- the Suns moved to 22-22. The last time they were at the break-even point was Jan. 8, when they were 4-4. They also moved into sole possession of ninth place in the Western Conference. The Suns were led by  Jared Dudley , who shot 8-for-12 for 23 points.  Steve Nash  tied a season high with 17 assists. "Nash did a real good job of kind of just picking us apart all night, making pin-point passes all night for easy scores," lamented Pistons guard  Ben Gordon . The Pistons, who had won four of five and 12 of their last 19 coming into the game, fell to 16-28. They were led by  Rodney Stuckey 's 23 points. They also got 12-for-16 shooting off the bench, including 5-5 from the defensive oriented  Ben Wallace . QUOTABLE:  "We know we have very little margin for error. We know we are still going to have to put together some wins and do it on the road because of some of the things we let slip away at home."    -- Suns coach  Alvin Gentry  on the Suns' playoff chances...and their modest 14-10 home record. THE STAT:  The Suns got 36 points from their reserves, a crucial contribution for a team playing for the third night in a row.  Michael Redd  scored 10 of his 11 points in the second quarter to help keep the game close; the Pistons led 59-54 at halftime. TURNING POINT:  When  Shannon Brown  and  Channing Frye  got hot in the closing minutes. The Suns trailed 91-89 when Brown hit a 3-pointer. After the Pistons'  Jason Maxiell  hit a layup to give the Pistons their final lead (93-92), Frye hit a 3-pointer, Dudley scored on a follow shot, then Frye threw up an off-balance 3-pointer under heavy pressure from Stuckey with the shot clock running down. Somehow it went in, giving the Suns a 100-95 lead. The Pistons had one last chance. They trailed 102-99 with 1:00 left when the Suns'  Grant Hill  stole a pass from Stuckey. The Suns then hit their free throws to seal it. QUOTABLE II:  "I got about four hours' sleep. My body was hurting ... somehow by the grace of God, it went in."    -- Frye on his improbable big shot. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Over the past six games, reserve center  Robin Lopez  has shot 20-for-37 (54 percent) for 9.0 points per game. INSIDE THE ARENA:  The Suns have failed to sell out a game this season. They fell about 1,000 short Friday night with an announced crowd of 17,148. ROOKIE WATCH:  The Pistons'  Brandon Knight  shot 6-for-16 for 17 points. He also had six assists, three rebounds and two turnovers. NOTABLE:  The Suns became only the fourth team this season to sweep a back-to-back-to-back set. The others are the teams with the NBA's best records: Chicago, Oklahoma City and Miami. UP NEXT:  For the Pistons, Sunday @ Los Angeles Clippers, Wednesday @ Denver and Friday vs. Miami. For the Suns, Sunday vs. Houston, Tuesday @ Miami and Wednesday @ Orlando.
