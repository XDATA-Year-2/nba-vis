  Notebook: Trail Blazers 101, Nets 88 Posted Thursday April 5, 2012 1:23AM By Kerry Eggers, for NBA.com THE FACTS:   LaMarcus Aldridge  (24 points, nine rebounds) and  Nicolas Batum  (20 points, 10 boards) led the way as the Trail Blazers put away the Nets 101-88 Wednesday night at the Rose Garden. New Jersey led 85-82 with 6:50 remaining, but Portland outscored the visitors 19-3 the rest of the way. J.J. Hickson  came off the bench for 18 points and eight rebounds and  Raymond Felton  contributed 14 points, nine assists and eight rebounds for the Blazers (26-29). Kris Humphries  collected 21 points and 11 rebounds for New Jersey (19-37), which went without point guard  Deron Williams  (stomach virus). QUOTABLE:  "That's the type of defense we want to play for 48 minutes. That's our identity. That's what we want to be. A very good defensive effort tonight."    -- Portland coach  Kaleb Canales , after the Blazers held New Jersey to .372 shooting. THE STAT:  The Nets started the second half with 2-for-16 shooting to fall behind 64-48 late in the third quarter, then went 0-for-11 to close the game. Other than that, they made 30 of 59 shots in the game. TURNING POINT:  The Blazers trailed by three midway through the fourth quarter, but Batum and Hickson combined 14 points and the Nets missed 11 straight shots the rest of the way. HOT:  The Blazers hit 6-for-8 shots in the middle of an 18-2 run that took them from a 46-46 tie to a 64-48 advantage in the third quarter. NOT:  Portland's  Wesley Matthews  finished 1-for-9 from the field. QUOTABLE II:  "Valiant effort by our team. ... give [the Blazers] credit. They came out in the third quarter like a team desperately trying to make the playoffs, and they put us on our heels. But then, because this team is not a bunch of quitters, they fight some more and we get the game back and we're battling. Then we just kind of ran out of gas."    -- New Jersey coach  Avery Johnson . INSIDE THE ARENA:  Carolina Panthers quarterback  Derek Anderson , a former Oregon State standout, was in the house. GOOD MOVE:  Felton threw back-to-back lob passes to Aldridge and Hickson for dunks, then tossed a bounce pass that Hickson converted for a jam in three straight third-quarter possessions. BAD MOVE:  Ahead 85-82, the Nets attempted six straight shots from beyond 20 feet instead of pounding the ball inside. They missed them all. QUOTABLE III:  "It feels good to get a win, man. I don't think about the individual stuff. I'm human. I'm going to make mistakes. I'm not going to do everything perfect all the time."    -- Raymond Felton, when asked if it felt good to have such a performance after a pair of miscues late in Monday's loss to Utah. NOTABLE:  Batum secured back-to-back double-doubles for the first time and also had the second 20-10 game of his career. UP NEXT:  For the Blazers, Friday at Dallas, Saturday at Milwaukee, Monday vs. Houston. For the Nets, Friday vs. Washington, Sunday vs. Cleveland, Tuesday vs. Philadelphia.
