 THE FACT : The Jazz exacted some revenge on the Kings for last week's overtime loss in Utah, getting out to a healthy lead early and eventually building their biggest lead of the season to start a quarter (24 points in the fourth) in the win. 
 
 THE LEAD:  The Utah Jazz shared the ball and hit open shots on their way to a 122-101 drubbing of the short-handed Sacramento Kings Wednesday night.  
 
 Richard Jefferson  led the way for Utah (5-19) with 20 points in just 21 minutes of action.  Gordon Hayward added 17 points, four rebounds and four assists, while big man  Derrick Favors  kicked in 17 points and seven rebounds in the win. Alec Burks also had 17 points. 
 With  Rudy Gay, Aaron Gray  and  Quincy Acy  lost in NBA trade limbo, the Kings played their second game in a row with only 10 players. 
 
 DeMarcus Cousins  led the way for Sacramento (6-14), notching a 21-point, 11-rebound double-double in just 23 minutes of foul-plagued ball.   Isaiah Thomas  dropped in 20 points and handed out seven assists, and  Derrick Williams  chipped in 13 points and seven rebounds. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It was real fun, especially the way we shared the basketball. People were playing for their teammates, not for themselves and that's the reason why we shot the ball so well and the reason why we came out on top."  
 
 --Gordon Hayward  
 
 
 THE STAT:  Utah had 35 assists to Sacramento's 13.  The Jazz were led by rookie  Trey Burke 's nine. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Kings came out flat in this game and the Jazz ran them off the court early.  Utah led by as many as 28 points and never trailed in the contest. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It was bad all around.  From the effort to defense to offense."  
 
 -- DeMarcus Cousins 
 
 
 HOT:  Jefferson turned back the clock, scoring 20 points on 7-for-9 shooting in 21 minutes of action.  
 
 NOT:  Rookie  Ben McLemore  struggled with his shot all night long, finishing with four points on 1-for-8 shooting. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Jazz moved the ball well all night, which led to easy buckets. Ten players finished the game with an assisted basket. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Thomas, Cousins and coach  Michael Malone  each picked up technical fouls in a frustrating loss for Sacramento tonight.    
 
 NOTABLE:  Utah set their season highs in points (122), assists (35), turnovers (6), largest lead (28) and largest margin of victory (21). 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Jazz, Friday @ Denver, Saturday vs. Spurs, Monday @ Miami. For the Kings, Friday @ Phoenix, Sunday vs. Houston, Tuesday @ Charlotte.
