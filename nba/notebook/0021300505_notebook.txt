 THE FACT:  The 76ers have now dropped five in a row to the Timberwolves after winning three straight before that. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Seven players scored in double figures as the Minnesota Timberwolves cruised past the Philadelphia 76ers 126-95 Monday night at the Wells Fargo Center.  Kevin Love  led the way with 26 points,  Kevin Martin  added 18 and  Nikola Pekovic  had 16 points and 14 rebounds.  Corey Brewer  scored 15 points and  J.J. Barea  had 13, while  Dante Cunningham  and  Alexey Shved  chipped in with 10 each. The Timberwolves evened their record at 17-17. 
 
 Thaddeus Young  paced the Sixers with 20 points.  James Anderson  had 14, while  Evan Turner  and  Michael Carter-Williams  contributed 13 apiece. The Sixers had their four-game winning streak snapped and fell to 12-22. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Just a really solid win for us. We came out at the start of the game and played well all the way through. We did a pretty good job of keeping them in the halfcourt and passed the ball and shot the ball well." 
 -- Timberwolves coach  Rick Adelman 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Timberwolves had 28 assists against 13 turnovers. If you're counting, that's better than a 2-to-1 ratio. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Timberwolves led 70-54 at halftime and blitzed the Sixers in the third quarter. Love had 16 points alone in the third and Minnesota extended its advantage to 105-74. Game over. 
 
 HOT:  Love was 7-for-12 from the field and 8-for-10 from the free-throw line. He also knocked down four of his seven 3-pointers. Anderson was 5-for-6 for the Sixers and provided a spark off the bench. 
 
 NOT:   Lavoy Allen  had given the Sixers a lift in recent games. Not this time. He missed both of his shots and was scoreless with three fouls in 9:09. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Timberwolves broke the game open in the third by going to their best player early and often. And Love delivered with a stellar 16-point effort. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Sixers struggled in defending the perimeter, a problem for them all season. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  On a frigid night in Philadelphia, a pretty good crowd of 10,736 attended the game. But they became restless in the second half and even booed the Sixers, despite a four-game winning streak entering the night. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I do think that there is a physical side of what you saw tonight, but the mental side of it upsets me far more. I feel that, I see that, far more than I do a fatigue factor." 
 -- Sixers coach  Brett Brown 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Young was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played from Dec. 30-Jan. 5. Young led the Sixers to a 3-0 record and he averaged 25.0 points per game. "I think it's a statement for Thaddeus," Brown said. ... Sixers backup point guard  Tony Wroten  was out with flu-like symptoms and a migraine. ... The Timberwolves played without forward  Chase Budinger  (left knee) ... The Sixers had reached the 100-point plateau in each of their last seven games before this one. ... Love scored at least 20 points for the 14th consecutive game. ... The Sixers have allowed 15 or more 3-pointers eight times this season. ... The Sixers are now 1-13 when scoring below 100 points this season. ... No Minnesota starter played more than 29:02. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "We moved the ball well. The second unit really came in and played great in the second quarter. It set us up and we finished off that second quarter very strong. Then we really didn't look back from there. We moved the ball extremely well. And we played better defense in the latter three quarters. It was a good win for us tonight." 
 --  Kevin Love
