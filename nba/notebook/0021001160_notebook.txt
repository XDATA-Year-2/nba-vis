  Warriors-Trail Blazers notebook   By Kerry Eggers, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday April 6, 2011 2:58AM THE FACTS: Monta Ellis, David Lee  and  Stephen Curry  combined for 87 points to lead Golden State past Portland 108-87 Tuesday night at the Rose Garden. The loss snapped an eight-game home win streak for the Blazers (45-33), who clinched a playoff berth with Sacramento's win at Houston. It was the most one-sided home loss of the season for Portland and the second victory in three meetings between the teams for the Warriors (34-44). QUOTABLE:  "A bad game. This is one of those games where you burn the tape and move on."    -- Portland coach  Nate McMillan THE STAT:  Through three quarters, Golden State was 7-for-11 from 3-point range, Portland 2-for-15. The Warriors wound up 7-for-16 on treys, the Blazers 3-for-21. TURNING POINT:  Golden State led 67-65 midway through the third quarter when the bottom fell out for the Blazers. Over the next six minutes, they were outscored 19-3. The Warriors led 84-68 after three quarters, and the rout was on. QUOTABLE II:  "One of our worst nights shooting. We had a lot of open looks; we just didn't make them. It was one of those nights."    -- Portland's  LaMarcus Aldridge , who finished with 17 points and 12 rebounds. HOT:  Ellis scored 30 points, Lee 29 and Curry 28. They combined to make 36 of 57 shots from the field, including 7-for-11 from 3-point land. NOT:   Brandon Roy  and  Rudy Fernandez  had a terrible time off the Blazer bench, combining to go 3-for-20. QUOTABLE III:  "My shot was just going down. Tonight was one of those nights where we never took the foot off the pedal."    -- Monta Ellis FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Lee was a monster with 29 points, 20 rebounds, two assists and two steals in 41 minutes. INSIDE THE ARENA:  St. Louis Rams tailback  Steven Jackson , Harlem Globetrotter legend  Meadowlark Lemon  were in attendance. GOOD MOVE:  Golden State packed in the defense and dared Portland to fire away from outside. The Blazers never found the range from the perimeter. BAD MOVE:  Portland never extended its defense on Ellis and Curry. The Warriors' free-wheeling backcourt pair kept bombing from afar, and making more times than not. ROOKIE WATCH:  Golden State's  Ekpe Udoh , minding the middle for the injured  Andris Biedrins , was 2-for-3 from the field and had four points, a rebound and a blocked shot in 19 minutes. NOTABLE:  Portland was 0-for-8 from 3-point range but shot 62.5 percent on 2-point attempts in the first half, which ended in a 47-47 tie. The Blazers were 3-for-13 on treys in the second half, while shooting 36.7 percent on 2-point tries. UP NEXT:  For the Blazers, Thursday @ Utah, Friday vs. L.A. Lakers, Tuesday vs. Memphis. For the Warriors, Wednesday vs. L.A. Lakers, Sunday vs. Sacramento, Monday @ Denver
