 THE FACT:  With an 11-9 record after Friday night's win, the Phoenix Suns would currently be the No. 3 team in the Eastern Conference. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Fast and small beat bigger and slower as the Suns, the NBA's top fast-break team but one of its worst rebounding groups, pressed the attack Friday night in a 106-97 win over the Toronto Raptors. 
 
 Markieff Morris  led the Suns, scoring 25 while taking only 14 shots. 
 The loss was the fifth in a row for the Raptors (6-12), who were coming off a loss Tuesday in which they misplaced a 27-point lead and lost to Golden State.  Amir Johnson  led the Raptors with a season-high 22 points and seven rebounds off the bench.  Kyle Lowry  added 21 points. 
 The Raptors'  Tyler Hansbrough  sprained his left shoulder while being fouled by  Channing Frye  and did not return. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "[Markieff Morris] has been smart about when to drive and when to shoot it."  
 
 --Suns coach  Jeff Hornacek 
 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I've got a great feel for the game right now." 
 
 --Markieff Morris 
 
 
 QUOTABLE II I :  "A lot of those [Suns] guys are trying to prove themselves. They're playing hungry."  
 -- Raptors coach  Dwayne Casey  on the Suns about an hour before tipoff 
 
 THE STAT:  The Raptors were supposed to have a big edge on the Suns on the boards -- they are No. 2 in rebounding percentage while the Suns came in No. 27 -- but the Suns outrebounded them, 53-36. 
 
 TURNING POINT : The Suns hit 3-for-5 on 3-pointers in the third quarter ( P.J. Tucker  hit a pair and  Eric Bledsoe  hit one) as they pulled out from a 52-50 halftime lead to 81-74 edge heading into the final quarter.  
 
 QUOTABLE IV:  "There have been a lot of surprises that have helped us [this season]."  
 
 -- Jeff Hornacek 
 
 
 HOT:  Morris shot 11-for-14. 
 
 NOT:  The Raptors hit only 5-for-19 on 3-pointers. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Suns played at a quick tempo throughout. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Raptors didn't go inside nearly enough. 
 
 IN THE ARENA:  The game drew an announced crowd of 12,672, a season low and the second-lowest in the history of the 21-year-old building (12,420 vs Miami on Dec. 2, 2002).  
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  The Suns'  Archie Goodwin  had two points and four boards in 13 minutes. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Tucker, once known as an "all-defense" player as Hornacek pointed out before the game, is coming into his own in other areas. On Wednesday, he shut down  James Harden  (who shot 3-for-17) while hitting 8-for-13 for 18 points. Friday against the Raptors, he once again scored 18 and had his season's first double-double with a career-high 13 rebounds. He helped guard  Rudy Gay  (who shot 6-for-15) and  DeMar DeRozan  (5-for-15). 
 
 QUOTABLE V:  "Now, he's playing an all-around game, which is great,"  
 
 --Jeff Hornacek 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Markieff Morris, who also had 11 boards, matched Cleveland's  Anderson Varejao  for the league lead with his third double-doube off the bench this season. 
 UP NEXT: For the Raptors, Sunday at Los Angeles Lakers, Tuesday vs. Spurs and Friday vs. 76ers. For the Suns, Tuesday at Los Angeles Lakers, Friday vs. Kings and Sunday, Dec. 15 vs. Warriors.
