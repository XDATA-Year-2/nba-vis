 THE FACT:   The Pacers improved to 6-0 at home against Western Conference teams, and have held them a cumulative 106.4 points below their respective scoring averages. 
 
 THE LEAD:   Adversity has been in short supply in Indiana's remarkable season, but the Pacers showed they know what to do when it arises. With  David West  ejected at the end of the first half and subsequent foul trouble to  Luis Scola  and  Roy Hibbert , the Pacers had to dig deep into the bench and go with a small lineup but nevertheless withstood a charge by the visiting Clippers to pull away for a 106-92 victory over Los Angeles before a sellout crowd of 18,165 Saturday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse.  Paul George  scored 36 to lead Indiana (32-7) to its 10th consecutive home victory, while  Lance Stephenson  had 22 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists.  Jamal Crawford  scored 22 off the bench for the Clippers (28-14), who had a five-game win streak snapped.  Blake Griffin  scored 19. 
 
 QUOTABLE:   "Proud of our guys for battling through some adversity ... We had to play a game we weren't used to playing tonight because of the circumstances and the guys on the court flat-out battled."  
 -- Indiana coach  Frank Vogel 
 
 
 THE STAT:   In their nine-game home win streak, the Pacers have outscored opponents by an average of 20.6 points.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Pacers used a 15-0 first-quarter run, during which the Clippers missed 13 consecutive shots, to open a 25-15 lead and pushed it to 57-41 at intermission. But on the final play of the half, West was given a Type 2 flagrant foul and ejected for hitting Griffin in the head with an elbow as the two became entangled battling for rebound position. When Scola and then Hibbert went to the bench with four fouls in the third period, the Clippers made their move, cutting what had been a 20-point deficit down to 81-72 early in the fourth quarter. But the Pacers dug in defensively, limiting the visitors to one bucket in the next 5½ minutes, while pitting together a lightning-quick 15-2 run that put it out of reach, 96-74. George punctuated the burst with a 3-pointer followed by a reverse 360 windmill dunk. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I just showed I've still got it. I'm still young, I've still got a little juice in my legs."  
 -- Paul George on his 360 dunk

 QUOTABLE III:  "We didn't play well at all.  Give them credit.  I thought their defense really rushed us.  We talked about how they tried to channel you into their bigs and we kept falling for it over and over again.  We just didn't execute offensively."  
 -- Clippers coach  Doc Rivers 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Redick gave the Clippers a scare when he left the game after colliding with Stephenson on a first-quarter drive, sustaining a left knee contusion, but he returned a few minutes later. ...
