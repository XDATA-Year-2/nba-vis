  Mavericks-Warriors notebook   By Steve Waterhouse, for NBA.com Posted Sunday April 3, 2011 2:41AM THE FACTS: Monta Ellis  shook off a strained right ankle and scored a game-high 32 points, 18 in a crucial third quarter as the Warriors battled back from a 10-point first half deficit to claim a thrilling 99-92 win over the Mavericks. It was the 20th time Ellis scored 30 or more points this season. And on defense,  David Lee  was a thorn in  Dirk Nowitzki's  side, keeping the All-Star forward in check with 16 points on a 5-for-16 shooting effort. Lee's defensive effort didn't take away from his offensive output with 16 points on 6-of-10 and grabbed eight rebounds.  Shawn Marion  led the way for the Mavs with 21 poins off the bench. QUOTABLE:  "You block it out and don't worry about it. What happens, happens."  --  Ellis said of his ankle. THE STAT:  The Warriors held the Mavs to under 100 points, the 20th time they have held an opponent under the century mark this season and are 16-4 when doing so. TURNING POINT:  The Warriors turned a two-point halftime deficit into a 68-57 lead with 4:10 left in the third quarter on an Ellis 3-pointer. It was his second 3-pointer in the span of a minute and capped a 13-0 run. QUOTABLE II:  "I thought David (Lee) was great being physical by not allowing Dirk (Nowitzki) to get to his spot where he can shoot from." --  Warriors coach  Keith Smart  said. HOT:  Ellis shot 4 of 8 from behind the arc. NOT:  The Mavs starting five (Nowitzki,  DeShawn Stevenson, Tyson Chandler, Rodrigue Beaubois  and  Jason Kidd ) shot a dismal 13 for 40 and scored just 36 points. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Mavs owner  Mark Cuban  sat in his usual spot behind the players' bench. GOOD MOVE: Lou Amundson  and  Al Thornton  saw extended playing time and it paid dividends. Amundson, who played a season-high 27:54 minutes, tied a season-high with seven rebounds to go with eight points. Thornton, who played 23:08 minutes, tied a seson high with nine rebounds and two blocks to go with 12 points. NOTABLE:  The Mavs made a run in the fourth to cut the Warriors lead to 93-90 with a pair of Nowitzki free throws but the Warriors extended that lead to 96-90 with 1:47 left on a  Stephen Curry  3-pointer that brought the 18,128 in attendance to their feet...Curry, who sat the entire second quarter with three fouls, finished with 12 points and dished out a team-high eight assists... Dorell Wright  (13 points) made a pair of 3-pointers that gives him 183 on the season and ties  Jason Richardson's  2005-06 single-season high mark for the Warriors...The Mavs are 3-2 on their current road trip that concludes Sunday night at Portland. This was their second loss in a row and ends a six-game win streak against the Warriors. They finish the season with a 3-1 record against the Warriors and are now 13-3 against Pacific Division teams. Their only losses to Pacific Division teams are against the Lakers and Warriors...After scoring seven points in the first quarter, Nowitzki was held to nine the rest of the way. UP NEXT:  For the Warriors, Tuesday @ Portland, Wednesday @ L.A. Lakers, April 10 vs. Sacramento. For the Mavericks, Sunday @ Portland, Wednesday vs. Denver, Friday vs. Clippers.
