 THE FACT:  The Knicks dropped their ninth straight game and seventh in a row at Madison Square Garden. The last time they lost nine in a row was 2006. The seven consecutive home losses ties a franchise record. 
 
 THE LEAD: Ryan Anderson  poured in a season-best 31 points and  Tyreke Evans  scored 24 as the New Orleans Pelicans won their second straight, 103-99, over the Knicks at Madison Square Garden on Sunday night. 
 
 Jrue Holiday  added 11 points and  Eric Gordon  10 for New Orleans (8-8). 
 
 Carmelo Anthony  led the Knicks (3-13) with 23 points on 9-for-21 shooting and 10 rebounds.  Tim Hardaway Jr . scored a career-best 21 points for New York, which last won a home game Oct. 30. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I think we just outplayed them. We had a little bit more effort and really just imposed our will on them."  
 
 -- Ryan Anderson 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Knicks started 11-for-23 from the arc, and finished 2-for-12 to finish 13-for-35. The Knicks entered shooting 32 percent from the arc, 27th in the NBA. 
 
 THE STAT II:  The Pelicans' bench outscored the Knicks' reserves 67-40. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  After the Knicks went ahead 93-88 on a 3-pointer from Hardaway, Jr., the Pelicans rattled off a 10-0 run that put them ahead, 98-93. Evans had five points in the spurt. Trailing 102-99, the Knicks had two looks to tie it with 3-pointers, but both Hardaway Jr. and Anthony misfired. Evans then went 1-for-2 on free throws to extend the lead to 103-99. The Knicks misfired on three more attempts from deep in the final seconds -- two by  J.R. Smith  and one by Anthony. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Until we are able to take pride in guarding the ball, there are going to be nights like this. ..We needed some stops and we couldn't get them."  
 
 -- Knicks coach  Mike Woodson 
 
 
 HOT:  Anderson shot 11-for-21 from the field and 7-for-11 from the arc off the bench for New Orleans. His career-best is 34 points. 
 
 NOT:  While Hardaway Jr. excelled,  Iman Shumpert  shot 3-for-5 for seven points in 21 minutes. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "We moved the ball tonight. We did a great job of just finding the open man and guys like  Jason [Smith ] did a great job of screening, but mostly we just moved the ball."  
 
 -- Ryan Anderson 
 
 
 QUOTABLE IV:  "I thought Tim Hardaway was a bright spot tonight. I thought he came in and kept us in the game with his offense. But defensively we gotta get better."  
 
 -- Mike Woodson 
 
 
 NOTABLE: Anthony Davis  suffered a non-displaced fracture in his left hand in the first quarter on a dunk attempt and did not return. He sat on the Pelicans' bench with his left hand wrapped. A timetable for his return is TBD. He entered averaging 19.6 points and 10.6 rebounds. 
 
 QUOTABLE V:  "I'm good. Going up for a lob in the first quarter I got fouled and hit my hand on the rim."  
 
 -- Anthony Davis 
 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  Floyd Mayweather Jr., Cecily Strong, Ben Stiller, Clive Owen and John McEnroe sat courtside. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Knicks, Thursday @ Brooklyn, Friday vs. Orlando, Sunday vs. Boston. For the Pelicans, Monday @ Chicago, Wednesday vs. Dallas, Friday vs. Oklahoma City.
