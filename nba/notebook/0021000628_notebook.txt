  Clippers-Blazers notebook   By Kerry Eggers, for NBA.com Posted Friday January 21, 2011 2:04AM THE FACTS:   LaMarcus Aldridge  and  Wesley Matthews  each scored 28 points as Portland (24-20) won its fourth in a row, beating the Los Angeles Clippers 108-93 Thursday night at the Rose Garden.  Eric Gordon  led the Clippers (16-26), who had won six of their last seven, with 35 points. QUOTABLE:  "We were so tired ? very, very tired. You watch the first five minutes, you could tell, no? Guys had played 40, 42, 46 minutes last night, and we're missing [ Marcus ]  Camby , so we have one less rotation guy. But this team has heart. Even when we're tired, people step up."    --  Nicolas Batum . THE STAT:  The Blazers missed seven of their first eight shots in falling behind 16-2. From that point, they shot .615, finishing the game at .564 while outscoring the Clippers 106-77 the rest of the way. TURNING POINT:  Batum nailed back-to-back 3-pointers to send Portland into the fourth quarter ahead 84-71. QUOTABLE II:  "Most players play one or the other ? they're a good defender or they score. He can do both. You don't want to take his perimeter game away, but he has committed to playing the paint, and he's done a great job."    --  Nate McMillan  on Aldridge. HOT:  Aldridge sank 13 of 20 shots, using his full repertoire of perimeter jumpers, moves to the basket and dunks off lob passes. NOT:  The Blazers did a nice job of blanketing  Blake Griffin , who made only 6-for-17 from the field and committed five turnovers. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Gordon had the long ball working, knocking down 7-for-11 from 3-point range en route to a 35-point night. INSIDE THE ARENA:  The crowd of 20,630 was the 135th straight announced sellout at the Rose Garden dating to December 2007. GOOD MOVE:   Rudy Fernandez  scored the basket of the night with 1:03 remaining, colliding with Aldridge, but somehow winding up with the ball and flipping in a running 13-footer as the shot clock expired. BAD MOVE:  Any time a Clipper other than Gordon tossed up a 3-point attempt. His teammates were a combined 2 for 15 from beyond the arc. ROOKIE WATCH:  It wasn't his best night, but Griffin found a way to collect 20 points and 18 rebounds along with four rebounds and two steals. NOTABLE:  It was Portland's ninth win in the last 10 meetings with the Clippers. UP NEXT:  For the Blazers, Indiana Saturday, Sacramento Monday, Boston Thursday. For the Clippers, Golden State Saturday, at Dallas Tuesday, at Houston Wednesday.
