 THE FACT:  Kevin Durant  surpassed his league-leading scoring average with 30 points, added 10 rebounds and made several critical defensive plays in the fourth quarter of the OKC win. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Durant led the Thunder to a 101-92 win over the host Hawks at Phillips Arena on Tuesday night. Oklahoma City (16-4) appeared on the verge of taking control a few times, but on each occasion the Hawks (11-11) rallied.  Paul Millsap  had 23 points and a game-high 12 rebounds, while  Shelvin Mack  came off the bench to score a career-high 17 points to keep the home team in range.  
 Ultimately, the Hawks did not have the firepower to offset three double-doubles by the Thunder. Beyond Durant,  Serge Ibaka  had 19 points and 10 rebounds and  Russell Westbrook  added 14 points and 11 assists as the Thunder evened their road record at 5-5. Westbrook also had nine rebounds to just miss a triple-double.  
 Atlanta point guard  Jeff Teague  scored 13 of his 17 in the third quarter, but the Hawks shot just 36 percent.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We had the game up to 14 or 15 twice, and we let them back in . . . we just always tell each other, 'weather the storm,' no matter what." 
 
 -- Kevin Durant 
 
 
 THE STAT:   26 percent. The Hawks' starting front court combined to shoot just 10-for-38 (26.3 percent), while the Thunder's front line went 17-for-36 (47.2). Millsap led Atlanta with 23 points, but that was largely because he was 11-for-12 from the line. He was 5-for-18 from the field, where  Al Horford  shot 3-for-10 for seven points and  DeMarre Carroll  shot 2-for-10 for seven points.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We missed a lot of layups earlier in the game that came back to bite us." 
 
 -- Shelvin Mack 
 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Hawks began the fourth on 7-2 sprint to draw to 78-75 on  Lou Williams ' 3-point shot. OKC coach  Scott Brooks  called timeout with 10:16 left, and sent Durant back in the game. On three consecutive Atlanta possessions, Durant had a blocked shot on  Kyle Korver , another blocked shot ( Mike Scott ) and a steal from Williams to spark a 10-3 OKC run. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "There were a lot of good defensive efforts; any time you hold an NBA team in the 30s, percent-wise, you're doing a good job. I think in that [Durant] had a couple blocks, and a couple steals, and we had a couple scores in transition." 
 
 -- Scott Brooks  
 
 
 HOT :  Ibaka was 7-for-14 from the floor for the Thunder. Teague shot 4-for-7 and made all five of his free throws for 13 points with three rebounds, two assists and a steal in the third quarter.  
 
 NOT:   Mack's three made 3-pointers (3-for-5) were a career high. Westbrook was 4-for-18 through three quarters before making two of three in the fourth. Teague missed all four of his shots in the first half.  
 
 IN THE ARENA:  Hip hop artist 2 Chainz (Tauheed Epps) of nearby College Park was in attendance. 
 
 NOTABLE:   Millsap has hit at least one 3-point shot in a career-best seven consecutive games. . . . Thunder guard  Thabo Sefalosha  missed the game with a strained right knee. Rookie  Andre Roberson  started in his place, and made his only shot to finish with two points, five rebounds and a blocked shot in 12:15. . . . Reserve big man  Gustavo Ayon  was unavailable for Atlanta after suffering a left ankle sprain and left leg contusion in Friday's win over the Cavs. . . . Korver  shot 1-for-6 on 3-pointers, giving him at least one trey in 91 consecutive games to further his NBA record.  
 
 UP NEXT:   For the Thunder, Wednesday @ Memphis, Friday vs. L.A. Lakers, Sunday vs. Orlando. For the Hawks, Friday vs. Washington, Saturday at New York, Monday vs. L.A. Lakers.
