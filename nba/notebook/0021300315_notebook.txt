 THE FACT:  Minnesota has defeated Detroit seven consecutive times. The Pistons' last victory against the Timberwolves was a 103-98 triumph in Minnesota during their 2009-10 season finale.  
 
 THE LEAD:  Power forward  Kevin Love  piled up 26 points, 16 rebounds and seven assists in 30 minutes as the Minnesota Timberwolves overpowered the Detroit Pistons 121-94 on Tuesday night at The Palace of Auburn Hills. Shooting guard  Kevin Martin  and center  Nikola Pekovic  contributed 18 points apiece for Minnesota (10-11) and point guard  Ricky Rubio  added 15 points and nine assists. Point guard  Brandon Jennings  led the Pistons (10-12), who lost their second straight, with 20 points and seven assists. Small forward  Josh Smith  added 17 points, but just one after halftime. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It's really a holy place for me and it has been my whole life. Any time I've had some sort of adversity, it's the best way to get back. I always say my work ethic is my weapon. That's always been a way to get through any adversity. It was great to get back out there." 
 
 -- Love, who had not played since Dec. 1 following the death of his grandmother 
 
 
 THE STAT:   28-8. The Timberwolves were the more aggressive team throughout and that was reflected in the free throw disparity. Minnesota outscored Detroit 28-8 at the line while taking 17 more free throws. Love made all 10 of his attempts. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Detroit led by one with seven minutes remaining in the first half. The Timberwolves then took complete control with a 21-5 outburst, including 10 points from Martin, for a 62-47 lead. Minnesota led by double digits the rest of the way. 
 
 HOT:  Pekovic was on a roll, averaging 20 points on 51.9 percent shooting and 10.4 rebounds in his last five games. There was no let up on Tuesday, as he was 7-for-14 from the field and grabbed five rebounds in 33 minutes. He only played 15 second-half minutes as coach  Rick Adelman  emptied his bench. 
 
 NOT:  Detroit's prolific frontcourt duo of  Andre Drummond  and  Greg Monroe  was thoroughly outplayed by the combination of Love and Pekovic. Drummond had eight points and eight rebounds in 29 minutes, as his streak of six consecutive six-plus offensive rebounds was snapped. Monroe had 10 points and just two rebounds while playing only 20 minutes, six in the second half. Monroe was overmatched trying to guard Love on the perimeter.  
 
 FANTASY FOCUS:  Pistons veteran guard  Chauncey Billups  returned after a 14-game absence due to left knee tendonitis. He showed rust on his shot, going 2-for-7 from the field  while scoring seven points. But he had five assists in 18 minutes and he'll continue to play regularly. The Pistons need his ball handling and outside shooting, whether coach  Mo Cheeks  uses him off the bench or pairs him with starting point guard Brandon Jennings. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Pistons rookie guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope had a career-high 16 points and also grabbed four rebounds. Detroit forward  Tony Mitchell  played nine garbage-time minutes and had four points and four rebounds, both season highs, but foreign import and forward  Gigi Datome  missed all six of his field-goal tries. Minnesota forward  Robbie Hummel  racked up eight points in 10 minutes. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Minnesota had 31 assists on 41 made field goals while out-rebounding the Pistons 46-39. Detroit had out-rebounded 15 of its first 21 opponents. ... Pistons guards  Rodney Stuckey  (knee) and  Will Bynum  (hamstring) were inactive. ... Love has 19 double-doubles, a league high. ... Detroit gave up a season high in points. The previous high was 119 to Oklahoma City. ... Minnesota's 27-point margin was the largest against Detroit in franchise history.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Timberwolves, Wednesday vs. Philadelphia, Friday @ San Antonio, Sunday @ Memphis. For the Pistons, Wednesday @ New Orleans, Friday vs. Brooklyn, Sunday vs. Portland.
