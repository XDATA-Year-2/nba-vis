 THE FACTS:  Dallas built a 26-point lead late in the third quarter Sunday night at the Rose Garden, and needed every bit of its cushion to close out a 96-91 victory over Portland. 
 
 Chris Kaman  scored a season-high 26 points and grabbed 11 rebounds for the Mavericks (38-39), who never trailed but had to hold off a furious Portland rally to win.  
 The win wasn't secure until the closing seconds, when, with Dallas in front 94-91, the Trail Blazers'  Damian Lillard  failed to convert on a driving layup. The Mavericks rebounded and got the ball to a streaking  Shawn Marion  for a basket at the buzzer. 
 Rookie  Will Barton  -- playing because of a second-quarter injury to shooting guard  Wesley Matthews --   came off the bench for season highs in points (22), rebounds (13) and assists (six) for the Trail Blazers (33-44), who lost their eighth straight game.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It's been frustrating. Now we have a good opportunity to go on our home court and play a team that's below .500. Hopefully, we can knock them off and get these beards shaven."  
 
 -- Kaman, speaking about the vow a couple of months ago by several members of the Mavericks to not shave until the team gets its record to .500. They can get there Wednesday at home against Phoenix 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Dallas overwhelmed Portland in nearly every statistical category in mounting a 56-32 lead at halftime, including field-goal percentage (53.3 to 37.1), rebounds (26-15), turnovers (4-10), points in the paint (30-12) and fast-break points (13-2). 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Mavericks extended a 24-point halftime advantage to 79-53 late in the third quarter and thought they had things wrapped up. Little did they know. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I'm just a confident, silly guy. I told  Sasha (Pavlovic)  and  Jared (Jeffries)  before the game, 'I'm going to have a career night tonight,' not knowing if I was even going to get in the game."  
 
 -- Barton, who carried averages of 2.9 points, 1.5 rebounds and 0.5 assists into the game 
 
 
 HOT:  Barton played the entire second half, totaling 18 points, 11 rebounds and five assists after intermission. 
 
 NOT: O.J. Mayo , who had been lights out in three earlier games against Portland, scored seven points on 3-for-12 shooting for the Mavericks. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Portland coach  Terry Stotts  turned Barton loose in the open court in the second half, and the 6-foot-5 guard from Memphis took advantage. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  With 3-point shooters Matthews and  Nicolas Batum  injured and Lillard colder than an Arctic wind, Stotts allowed Lillard to drive to the basket with seven seconds left. Even had he made it, the Blazers would have trailed by a point. They should have tried a 3-point attempt, period. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "Every win counts now. We have to keep winning and see what happens when we get to the finish line."  
 
 -- Marion 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Barton became the first rookie to collect as many as 22 points, 13 rebounds, six assists and three steals in a game since Detroit's  Grant Hill  in March 1995. ... Lillard scored 15 points on 6-for-19 shooting. In four games against Dallas this season, the point guard out of Weber State has gone 17-for-60 (28.3) and averaged 14.3 points, well below his 18.9-point average. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Wednesday vs. Phoenix, Friday vs. Denver, Sunday @ New Orleans. For the Trail Blazers, Wednesday vs. L.A. Lakers, Friday vs. Oklahoma City, Sunday @ Denver.
