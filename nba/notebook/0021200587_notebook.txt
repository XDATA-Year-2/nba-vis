 THE FACTS:   The Pacers believe  Paul George  and  David West  both deserve slots among the Eastern Conference All-Star reserves. Their performances Friday night offered compelling supporting evidence. George continued his hot streak, scoring 31 points, making seven 3-pointers and coming up with five steals while limiting  James Harden  to 17 points in 5-for-19 shooting, snapping the Houston star's streak of 22 consecutive games of at least 20 points. West had 20 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists as the Pacers contained Houston 105-95 for their 11th consecutive home win. The Rockets (21-20) lost their sixth straight overall despite a career-high 22 points and 12 rebounds from center  Omer Asik . Indiana reached the midpoint of the season 25-16, including a 16-3 mark at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Paul George, I don't know what to say, just another exceptional effort. David West almost a triple-double. We believe both of those guys are All-Stars but I'm pretty sure Paul solidified that tonight."  
 -- Indiana coach  Frank Vogel 
 
 
 THE STAT:  In his last six games, George has five double-doubles and has averaged 22.5 points, 10.0 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 3.17 steals. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  After yielding 34 second-quarter points to the Rockets and clinging to a 61-58 lead early in the third quarter, the Pacers clamped down in the third period, limiting the visitors to just two buckets in a span of more than seven minutes while putting together a 19-7 run to push what had been a three-point lead to 80-65.  Houston got no closer than seven in the fourth quarter. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We're getting good quality wins but we still have a lot of room to grow. Defensively we're holding up great but this road trip coming up is going to challenge us."  
 -- Paul George 
 
 
 HOT:   George had his third game of at least 30 points this season, and his third game of at least five steals in his last six. ... West also had three blocked shots to accompany his near triple-double. ... Asik shot 8-for-13 for the Rockets, blocking three shots. ... Houston's  Carlos Delfino  scored 17 off the bench, making 6-for-11 shots. 
 
 NOT:  Houston's power forward combination of  Patrick Patterson ,  Greg Smith  and  Marcus Morris  combined for three points, six rebounds and 1-for-15 shooting. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "I think everybody is worn out. We don't have a lot of zip right now or a lot of juice and we have to get it back. It's a long season and we have to find it again."  
 -- Houston coach  Kevin McHale 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Two of Indiana's top reserves were victimized by stomach ailments.  Gerald Green  was sent home before the game with food poisoning, while  Ian Mahinmi  did not return for the second half due to gastroenteritis. ... Coming off a three-game road trip, Indiana how heads West for the next four, all against teams with winning records. The Pacers are 1-9 on the road against above-.500 opponents. ... Houston's six-game losing streak followed a five-game win streak, the first time that has happened in franchise history. ... The Rockets entered the game tied for first in scoring at 105.4 but fell 10 points shy of that average against Indiana's defense, which ranks No. 1 at 89.1. ... This is Indiana's longest home streak since winning 14 in a row in 2002-03. ... George's seven 3-pointers tied the second most in team history. He set the record earlier this season with nine against New Orleans on Nov. 21. ... West has a team-high 12 double-doubles. ... Indiana improved to 12-2 when  Roy Hibbert  scores in double figures. He had 12 points. ... Asik's double-double was his 17th of the season.  
 
 UP NEXT:   For the Pacers, Monday at Memphis, Wednesday at Portland, Saturday at Utah. For the Rockets, Saturday at Minnesota, Monday at Charlotte, Wednesday vs. Denver.
