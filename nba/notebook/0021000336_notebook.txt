  Rockets-Bucks notebook    By Rick Braun, for NBA.com Posted Saturday December 11, 2010 12:18AM THE FACTS:   Andrew Bogut  posted 24 points and 22 rebounds, including two big offensive rebound baskets in the fourth quarter, and  Brandon Jennings  added 19 points to help the Milwaukee Bucks to a 97-91 victory over the Houston Rockets Friday night at the Bradley Center. QUOTABLE:  "It's just a boost of confidence for me. I'm starting to feel better game in and game out. I'm doing much more treatment than I was doing in the pre-season and it's responding well, so I can get some confidence out of these four games. I had four double-doubles, and I've just got to keep working."   --  Bogut,  who has played the last four games after missing the previous five games with a sore back. THE STAT : Bucks guard  John Salmons  had 17 points on 7-of-12 shooting, marking the first time since Nov. 13 against Golden State -- a span of 11 games -- that he shot 50 percent or better. Salmons entered the game shooting just 36.4 percent and reached the 50 percent mark for just the fourth time in 22 games. He averaged 19.9 points and shot 46.7 percent in 30 games with the Bucks last season after being acquired in a trading-deadline deal. TURNING POINT:   Ersan Ilyasova's  three free throws with 35.8 seconds left were all the Bucks had four offense over a four-minute run down the stretch, but they were enough to put the Rockets away. The Bucks missed seven straight shots after Bogut's rebound basket with 4:16 left gave them a 90-82 lead. Milwaukee then went without a point for the next 3:40 before Ilyasova got  Luis Scola  in the air and drew a foul while shooting a 3-pointer. Ilyasova made all three free throws to give the Bucks a 93-85 lead. QUOTABLE II:  "It's just game by game. Every game I try to come out and have the same mentality and help my team win. I'll continue to work and hopefully I'll get my rhythm back."   -- Salmons HOT:   Courtney Lee  rained in 7 of 10 shots and both 3-pointers he attempted to score 16 points off the bench for the Rockets. NOT:  Rockets starting guards  Kyle Lowry  (4 for 15) and  Kevin Martin  (5 for 13) and starting forwards  Shane Battier  (2 for 8) and Luis Scola (4 for 13) combined to shoot 30.6 percent (15 for 49). Martin did redeem himself a little by making 12 of 13 free throws. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Bogut averaged 20.8 points and 16 rebounds on the Bucks' four-game home stand. ROOKIE WATCH:  Bucks rookie forward  Larry Sanders  missed all six shots he took and is 1 for 13 in his last two games. NOTABLE:  Before missing seven straight shots down the stretch, the Bucks had made 37 of 71 shots and were a threat to top the 50 percent mark. Instead, they finished at 48.1 percent, marking the 13th straight game they have failed to make half their shots. ... Houston's  Brad Miller  was assessed a flagrant 1 foul with 6:03 left in the game when he hammered Ilyasova across the neck on a drive to the basket. Ilyasova made just one of the two free throws and the Bucks did not score on the ensuing possession. UP NEXT:  For the Rockets, Saturday vs. Cleveland, Tuesday vs. Sacramento, Wednesday @ Oklahoma City. For the Bucks, Monday @ Dallas, Wednesday @ San Antonio, Saturday vs. Utah.
