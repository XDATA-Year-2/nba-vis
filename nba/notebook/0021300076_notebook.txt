 THE FACT:  It was the fifth consecutive victory for the 76ers over the Cavaliers at the Wells Fargo Center. 
 
 THE LEAD: Evan Turner  led six players in double figures in the Philadelphia 76ers' 94-79 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers Friday night at the Wells Fargo Center. Turner had 22 points, 10 rebounds and five assists,  Tony Wroten  scored a career-best 18 points and  Thaddeus Young  contributed 16.  Michael Carter-Williams  and  James Anderson  had 11 points each and  Spencer Hawes  chipped in with 10. The Sixers broke a two-game skid and upped their record to 4-2. 
 
 Dion Waiters  paced the Cavaliers with 18 points and  Tristan Thompson  compiled a double-double -- 13 points and 16 rebounds.  C.J. Miles  and  Jarrett Jack  scored 13 points each and  Kyrie Irving  had 10. The Cavaliers are 0-4 on the road and dropped to 2-4. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I think we're coming together as a unit. I like the progress and we can see how the hard work is showing in the games." --  Young. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Despite being undersized, the Sixers outscored Cleveland 48-28 in points in the paint. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  After going ahead 44-42 at halftime, the Sixers outscored the Cavaliers 33-19 in the third quarter. It was more than enough of a cushion on this particular night. 
 
 HOT : Turner was 10-for-18 and Young knocked down 8 of 12 shots. 
 
 NOT:  Irving struggled mightily, going 4-for-17 while Waiters was 7-for-19. The Cavaliers shot 33.3 percent overall -- 30-for-90. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Sixers put the ball in Young's hands early and it paid off. He scored a couple of easy baskets early in the game, got his confidence going and carried it throughout the night. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Cavaliers settled for way too many jump shots. When the shots weren't falling, they didn't go inside nearly enough. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The crowd of 15,219 was revved up from the start, especially with the return of  Andrew Bynum . He was booed every time he had the basketball. Bynum never played for the Sixers last season after being acquired in a blockbuster trade because of bilateral bruises on both knees. Bynum had four points and five rebounds and had a smile on his face all night. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "He's a pro. He really wants to get better. He likes the development side of things." --  Sixers coach Brett Brown, on Turner. 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Sixers center  Daniel Orton  missed the game with right knee soreness. ... Cavaliers forward  Anthony Bennett , the No. 1 overall pick in the most recent NBA Draft, suffered a sprained right shoulder and played only 5:54. Bennett is just 1-for-20 from the field thus far in his rookie season. ... In five career games against the Sixers, Irving hasn't scored more than 12 points and is averaging 8.8 points on 28.3 percent shooting. ... Turner earned his first double-double of the season and reached the 20-point plateau for the fifth time in six games. ... Wroten has reached double figures in five of six games. ... The Cavaliers were 9-for-26 from beyond the arc. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "It was kind of funny." --  Bynum, on the reception he got from the Sixers fans. 
 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Cavaliers, Saturday vs. Philadelphia, Monday @ Chicago, Wednesday @ Minnesota. For the Sixers, Saturday @ Cleveland, Monday vs. San Antonio, Wednesday vs. Houston.
