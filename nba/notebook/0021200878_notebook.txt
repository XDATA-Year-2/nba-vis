 THE FACTS: Ersan Ilyasova  scored five of his 29 points in overtime, and  Brandon Jennings  had a career-high 19 assists to go with 11 points, as the Milwaukee Bucks earned a 122-114 victory over the Toronto Raptors Saturday night at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. 
 The Bucks solidified their hold on the eighth and final playoff spot in the East, maintaining a six-game lead over Philadelphia and improving to a 7 1/2-game margin over the Raptors. 
 
 Monta Ellis  had 23 points and five assists,  J.J. Redick  added 16 points and  Larry Sanders  had 13 points, 12 rebounds and five blocks as the Bucks (29-28) won their third straight.  Alan Anderson  led Toronto (23-37) with 21 points, including a baseline drive for a dunk with 1.6 seconds left to send the game to overtime. Milwaukee scored the first seven points of overtime, and led by at least four the rest of the way as the Raptors lost their fourth straight. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "That's how you grow as a team. It just shows our character and how we continue to play hard and come up with wins." 
 -- Monta Ellis  
 
 THE STAT : That the Bucks shot 50 percent (46-for-92) and had 32 assists on their 46 field goals was one thing, but what stands out more is that Milwaukee ran its offense so efficiently that Toronto was only able to score seven fast-break points in the 53 minutes. 
 
 TURNING POINT : Sanders, the third-year center who hardly made a peep in his first two seasons, grabbed an Ellis miss in traffic and slammed it down for the first points of overtime. Sixteen seconds later at the other end Sanders blocked  Landry Fields ' shot, and the Bucks were off and running. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I'm just trying to be consistent -- trying to stay in the game, keep growing, keep getting better, and it's working."  
 -- Larry Sanders on his continuing development  
 
 HOT : With Ilyasova going 12-for-21 and Sanders going 6-for-8, the Bucks' two big men combined to go 18-for-29 (62.1 percent). 
 
 NOT: DeMar DeRozan  had 18 points for Toronto but went just 6-for-21 to get them. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT : Along with his 29 points -- three short of his career-high -- Ilyasova also added 11 rebounds.  
 
 GOOD MOVE : Sanders picked up two fouls in the first 7:04 of the first quarter and had to go to the bench. Foul trouble is the one thing that has kept Sanders off the floor, but he did not pick up another foul the rest of the night. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Bucks forward  John Henson  went 4-for-5 and scored eight points in just 8:47 of playing time -- all in the first half.  
 
 NOTABLE : Raptors forward  Rudy Gay  tried in pre-game to get loose but couldn't overcome back spasms that bothered him Friday night against Indiana and did not play. Gay is averaging 20.5 points in the 13 games he's played for Toronto since being acquired on Jan. 30. ... The Bucks have won nine straight games against Toronto. ... Sanders extended his streak of games with at least one block to 39 straight. ... The Bucks had 32 assists and are 15-2 in games where they have at least 30 assists. ... Toronto point guard  Kyle Lowry  had a triple-double, getting exactly 10 points, assists and rebounds each. He made two 3-pointers in the overtime.  
 
 UP NEXT : For the Raptors, Monday @ Golden State, Wednesday @ Phoenix, Friday @ Los Angeles Lakers. For the Bucks, Monday vs. Utah, Wednesday @ Los Angeles Clippers, Saturday @ Golden State.
