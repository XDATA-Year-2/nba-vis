 THE FACT:  The Dallas Mavericks registered 17 steals in their win over the Los Angeles Lakers, the most in a victory since registering 19 against Washington on Feb. 10, 1994. 
 
 THE LEAD: Dirk Nowitzki  scored 27 points and  Monta Ellis  added 16 to pace Dallas to a 110-97 win over Los Angeles Tuesday night at the American Airlines Center, snapping a four-game home losing streak.  
 
 Vince Carter  came off the bench for 19 points, helping Dallas (20-15) possess a 32-16 bench-scoring advantage.  Jodie Meeks  led Los Angeles (14-21) with 24 points and handed out six assists. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We turned the ball over too many times. Especially in the crucial periods where we were trying to climb back in it. We can't have 20 turnovers and expect to win on the road. That makes it tough." 
 --Lakers coach  Mike D'Antoni 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Dallas did its damage near the rim, owning a 58-32 advantage in points in the paint. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Los Angeles closed Dallas' advantage down to 89-85 midway through the fourth quarter, but that's when Ellis caught fire -- scoring 10 straight points as the Mavericks opened up a double-digit lead. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I kept attacking the basket and kept taking my shot and eventually they started going down." 
 --Dallas guard Monta Ellis 
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Second-year guard  Kendall Marshall  continued his steady play for Los Angeles, registering 18 points and six assists. He now has 38 assists in his last three games.  Jose Calderon  also filled the stat sheet, posting 12 points, eight assists and five steals. 
 
 NOTABLE: Shawn Marion  (shoulder contusion) took a hard fall in the second quarter when he tripped on Nowitzki's foot and did not return to the game. Mavericks coach  Rick Carlisle  said after the game Marion would not travel to San Antonio on Wednedsay. ...  Pau Gasol  has registered a double-double in three consecutive games. ... After being benched for Sunday's game against New York for missing practice,  Samuel Dalembert  played 13 minutes and grabbed five rebounds. ...  Nick Young  (back) said he's unsure if he will play Wednesday night in Houston. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Wednesday @ Spurs, Friday @ Pelicans, Saturday vs. Pelicans. For the Lakers, Wednesday @ Rockets, Friday @ Clippers, Tuesday vs. Cavaliers.
