  Notebook: Cavaliers 84, Raptors 80 Posted Friday April 6, 2012 11:22PM By Duane Watson, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  The Cleveland Cavaliers (18-35) ended their nine-game losing streak on Friday, beating the Toronto Raptors (20-36) 84-80. Despite missing starters  Kyrie Irving  and  Anthony Parker , the Cavaliers stormed back in the fourth quarter outscoring the Raptors 33-17. Antawn Jamison  carried the Cavaliers on his back scoring 25 points and eight rebounds, including 16 points in the fourth quarter. The Cleveland bench stepped up as well with  Lester Hudson ,   on 10-day contract, setting career-highs with 23 points and seven assists while,  Samardo Samuels  added 10 points and seven rebounds. The Raptors had a 42-39 lead at halftime and followed it with dominant third quarter outscoring the Cavaliers 21-12 for a 63-51 lead in the game. The Cavaliers responded in the fourth, starting the quarter on a 17-6 run with Jamison the game at 68-68 with 6:24 left. The game then went scoreless for the next two minutes until Samuels hit 1-for-2 free throws starting an 11-3 run. But more importantly the Raptors didn't make a basket from the field for the last six minutes of the game until the 27 second mark, which was too little too late. The Raptors winning streak ended at three games and were led by  DeMar DeRozan 's 28 points and Andrea Bargnani's 19 points and seven rebounds. QUOTABLE:  "We did a good job putting them on their heels. Somebody had to help Lester coming down and I was able to get a couple of open looks. Just did a great as far as getting me the ball and I was able to knock down some big shots."   -- Cavaliers forward Antawn Jamison THE STAT:  The Cavaliers couldn't put the ball in the net all night, shooting a dismal .342 per cent from the field going 25-for-73 and .294 per cent from the 3-point line on 5-for-17 shooting, yet they still won the game. TURNING POINT:  The Cavaliers started the fourth quarter on a 17-6 run and the Raptors had a scoreless drought only making three field goals in the last 6 minutes of the game, all of which came inside the last 30 seconds. QUOTABLE II:  "The 10-day is almost up, so I said to myself, 'If you stay, you got to make these. Do not worry about the crowd.' And I made them, so hopefully I can stay."   -- Cavaliers guard Lester Hudson on his end of the game free throws. HOT:  Bargnani started the game hot, shooting 6-for-7 from the field scoring 13 of the Raptors first 17 points of the game. He finished the first half with 14 points and has been shooting .535 per cent from the field and averaging 22.4 points over his last 5 games. NOT:  With starters Irving (sprained shoulder) and Parker (bruised sternum) both out with injuries, the Cavaliers starting back court were a combined 3-for-16 from the field and 1-for-5 from the 3-point line.  Donald Sloan  and  Manny Harris  could only muster eight total points between the two of them. NOTABLE:  Three players started the game who are currently on 10-day contracts, Manny Harris for the Cavaliers and  Ben Uzoh  and  Alan Anderson  just signed their second 10-day contracts ... Raptors guard  Justin Dentmon  scored in his first game after being called up and signed to a 10-day contract yesterday ... Cavaliers head coach  Byron Scott  was ejected with 53 seconds left in the second quarter with a double technical ... Toronto wins the season series (3-1) with Cleveland for the second consecutive year .... UP NEXT:  For the Raptors, Sunday @ Oklahoma City, Monday @ Indiana and Friday vs. Philadelphia. For the Cavs, Sunday @ New Jersey, Tuesday vs. Charlotte and Wednesday vs. Indiana.
