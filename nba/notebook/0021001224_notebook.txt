
 Rockets-Wolves notebook   By Jim Beilby, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday April 13, 2011 11:40PM THE FACTS:  With nothing for either team to play for but pride and with defense a rare commodity, the Houston Rockets had the final offensive surge, defeating the Minnesota Timberwolves, 121-102.  Chase Budinger  scored a career-high 35 points to lead the Rockets and  Goran Dragic  achieved his first career triple-double with 11 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists. QUOTABLE:  "It was time to dig down in and not go into summer with a loss and something you have to think about potentially for the next nine months."   -- Rockets guard  Kevin Martin THE STAT:  With  Kevin Love  on the bench due to a strained groin, Houston was able to control the boards, outrebounding Minnesota 56-49. Houston also had 32 assists, compared to Minnesota's 20. TURNING POINT:  Leading by one going into the final quarter, Houston outscored Minnesota 31-13 in the final quarter to secure the victory. QUOTABLE II:  "I am going to hold on to the fact that there were a hole lot of positive things that happened this season. Obviously, the record was atrocious. Nobody feels good about that but there was probably a 3 1/2 month stretch during the season that we were playing some really good basketball and we started to grow and blossom as a ball club."   -- Minnesota coach  Kurt Rambis IN THE ARENA:  There were signs in the arena, directly across from the Wolves bench, reading 'Fire Kahn' and 'Fire [owner, Glen] Taylor.' NOTABLE:  The speculation is that Rambis' job is in jeopardy. The interview given by Minnesota general manager  David Kahn , Wednesday, if anything, amplified that speculation. UP NEXT:  For the Wolves and the Rockets, the offseason.
