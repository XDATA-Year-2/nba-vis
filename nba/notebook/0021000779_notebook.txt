  Clippers-Knicks notebook   By Adam Zagoria, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday February 9, 2011 10:57PM THE FACTS: Randy Foye  scored 17 of his game- and season-high 24 points in the fourth quarter as the Los Angeles Clippers snapped a seven-game road losing streak with a 116-108 win over the Knicks at Madison Square Garden. QUOTABLE:  "Coach just called my number. My mentality wasn't to go in there and just take shots. I was just thinking about making the right play, and if somebody was open, pass it. And if not, take the shot."    -- Foye THE STAT:  Clippers guard  Baron Davis  had 16 points and 16 assists, including 11 dimes in the first half when L.A. seized a 58-47 lead. TURNING POINT:  After the Knicks trimmed a 20-point second-half deficit to 106-102 on a shot off the glass by  Amar'e Stoudemire , the Clippers rattled off an 8-0 run, started by a 3-pointer from Foye, to go up 114-102. QUOTABLE II:  "Each one of us has got to look at ourselves individually and I don't know if it's preparation, it's just something we gotta change."    -- Knicks' guard  Landry Fields HOT:  Foye entered averaging just 7.0 points, but finished 8-for-15 overall and 4-for-7 from beyond the arc. NOT:  Fields,  Danilo Gallinari  and  Wilson Chandler  went a combined 4-for-18 in the first half for the Knicks. After the Knicks took a 29-28 first-quarter lead, the Clippers outscored New York 30-18 in the second quarter behind 10 points from  Ryan Gomes  and seven apiece from Davis and  Eric Bledsoe . NOTABLE:  The Clippers, in the middle of an 11-game road swing, won just their fourth road game of the season. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Yankees manager  Joe Girardi , actor  Tracy Morgan  and  Jeremy Sisto  of "Law & Order" were in the house. UP NEXT:  For the Knicks, Friday vs. L.A. Lakers, Saturday @ New Jersey, Tuesday vs. Atlanta. For the Clippers, Friday @ Cleveland, Sunday @ Toronto, Monday @ Milwaukee.
