 THE FACTS:  The New Orleans Hornets had just one starter finish in double figures, but their bench was the story Sunday in a 91-83 road win over the Memphis Grizzlies at FedExForum. Reserve forwards  Ryan Anderson  and  Jason Smith  combined to score 38 of the Hornets' 51 bench points, including seven during a key 9-0 fourth-quarter scoring run, to help New Orleans (15-29) snap a two-game losing streak.  Zach Randolph  led the Grizzlies (28-15) with 20 points and 13 rebounds. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Obviously making shots was huge for us to kind of eliminate a run for them. At the same time, I was more focused on getting stops on the defensive end. I think my team did a great job of finding me and I just took the shots I normally take when I'm open."  --  Anderson on his hot shooting from long range. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Anderson went 7-of-13 from 3-point range, helping New Orleans go 9-of-20 from deep as a team. The fifth-year forward's seven 3-pointers Sunday were just one off his career- and season-high of eight. Anderson didn't attempt a shot inside the arc in registering a game-high 22 points while adding five rebounds. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The game featured 16 ties and 17 lead changes before the Hornets took the lead for good on a  Lance Thomas  bucket with 9:37 left. It was still a one-point game (77-76) when New Orleans guard  Eric Gordon  converted a layup to start a 9-0 run. Smith (16 points) followed with made jump shots on back-to-back possessions before Anderson capped the run with a fadeaway 3-pointer with the shot-clock expiring.  
 
 HOT:  Though he went 0-of-5 from 3-point range in a 100-82 loss to Houston on Friday, Anderson has shot 44.4 percent (16-of-36) from beyond the arc in New Orleans' last four games. He went 7-of-14 in a 114-105 win over Sacramento last Monday. 
 
 NOT:  Grizzlies forward  Rudy Gay  remains mired in a shooting slump. He went 3-of-17 from the field against New Orleans on Sunday, finishing with 10 points. Gay has gone 24-of-82 (29.3 percent) from the floor over Memphis' last five games.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Just taking too many jump shots. We got to attack the basket. Wasn't just him, but in that first quarter when he had the chance, we just took a lot of jump shots."  --  Grizzlies coach  Lionel Hollins  on Gay's struggles offensively. 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Grizzlies guard  Mike Conley  sprained his left ankle early in the first quarter and didn't return. Conley was in a walking boot in the locker room after the game, but  Hollins said Conley will "probably" play Monday when Memphis travels to face the Philadelphia 76ers. ... Anderson's seven 3-pointers were the most made against the Grizzlies since  Toney Dogulas  made nine on March 17, 2010 at New York. ... The Hornets limited the Grizzlies to 5-of-21 shooting in the fourth quarter. ... New Orleans is now 7-4 with Gordon back in the starting lineup (8-5 overall). Gordon finished with eight points and four steals.  Greivis Vasquez , a former first-round pick of the Grizzlies, went 2-of-16 from the field in a five-point performance, but he added 11 assists.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Hornets, Tuesday @ Clippers, Wednesday at Utah, Friday at Denver. For the Grizzlies, Monday @ Philadelphia, Thursday @ Oklahoma City, Friday vs. Washington.
