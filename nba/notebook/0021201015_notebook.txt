 THE FACTS: Brook Lopez  might enjoy playing in Dallas even more than  Deron Williams , who grew up in the area. Lopez racked up a season-high 38 points and 11 rebounds and Williams scored 31 points Wednesday as the Brooklyn Nets overpowered the Dallas Mavericks 113-96. 
 Lopez was 15-for-22 and matched his point total from his last game at the American Airlines Center on Feb. 28, 2012. Williams, who played high school basketball in the Dallas suburb The Colony, did most of his damage in the second half with 26 points on 11-for-18 shooting.  Reggie Evans  added 22 rebounds for Brooklyn (40-28), who outscored the Mavericks 52-34 in the paint and outrebounded them by 11.  
 It was a tough start to a six-game homestand for the Mavericks (32-36), who went cold in the fourth quarter and never had an answer for Lopez and  Andray Blatche  (14 points) inside.  Dirk Nowitzki  led four Dallas starters in double figures with 16 points. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "It was a great win. ... Brook likes the building, evidently. Deron was out of his mind ... A lot of guys played very, very well for us." 
 --Nets coach  P.J. Carlesimo 
 
 
 THE STAT : When Nowitzki grabbed his fourth rebound of the game in the fourth quarter, he became just the 10th player in NBA history with 24,000 points and 9,000 boards. He joined  Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Elvin Hayes, Moses Malone, Karl Malone, Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon, Patrick Ewing  and  Kevin Garnett . 
 
 TURNING POINT : The lead changed hands for the 12th and final time on a three-point play by Williams that put Brooklyn up 61-59 early in the third quarter. The Nets' next two possessions also resulted in and-one layups by  Gerald Wallace  and Lopez. Brooklyn shot 68.4 percent (13-for-19) in the third quarter. Dallas was 11-for-17 in the period, but none of those shots were by Nowitzki and the Mavs also committed six of their 11 turnovers in the third. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "They had two guys that had great games and we didn't do a good job there. It's a bad result for us. ... This is an ongoing challenge for us, being able to keep teams at or under 100. We've got to keep going and keep working on it." 
 --Mavericks coach  Rick Carlisle 
 
 
 QUOTABLE III : "When you're feeling good, you feel like you can't miss. It's a good feeling. I looked over at my bench and saw the excitement. This was a big win for us, in my hometown or whatnot, this was a big win no matter what." 
 --Deron Williams 
 
 HOT : Blatche was 6-for-6 in the first half. Nowitzki finished 8-for-10. Dallas point guard  Mike James  (12 points) was 4-for-8 from 3-point range and has made at least one trey in 11 straight games. 
 
 NOT : Mavericks leading scorer O.J. Mayo failed to reach double digits for the third time in seven games, finishing with nine points and four turnovers. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA : The AAC crowd greeted Williams with mostly boos. He was courted by the Mavericks during free agency last summer before re-signing with the Nets. 
 
 NOTABLE : Mavericks forward  Shawn Marion  (strained left calf) and Nets forward  Kris Humphries  (tight lower back) both missed their eighth straight games. ... Dallas lost for just the third time this year when shooting 50 percent or better (16-3). ... Brooklyn improved to 24-4 against teams with a record below .500. ... This was the Nets' 18th road victory, their most since 2005-06. ... Brooklyn has tallied more defensive rebounds than its opponents in eight straight games. ... Wallace matched his season high with five steals (three times). ... Mavericks guard  Rodrigue Beaubois  had surgery to repair a fractured bone in his left hand (second metacarpal). There is no timetable for his return. ... Brooklyn and Dallas split the season series. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Mavericks, Friday vs. Boston, Sunday vs. Utah, Tuesday vs. L.A. Clippers. For the Nets, Saturday @ L.A. Clippers, Sunday @ Phoenix, Wednesday @ Portland.
