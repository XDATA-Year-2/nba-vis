 THE FACTS:  The Dallas Mavericks kept alive hopes of ending the season with a winning record, moving to .500 with a 107-89 win over the New Orleans Hornets. 
 Dallas'  Dirk Nowitzki  became only the 17th player in NBA history to surpass 25,000 career points with a long jumper in the second quarter and finished with 19 for the game while  Shawn Marion  led the Mavericks with 21 points. 
 With two games left, Dallas (40-40) still has a chance at avoiding its first losing campaign since 1999-00. That's all the Mavericks have left to play for after missing out on the playoffs for the first time in 13 years. 
 New Orleans (27-54) didn't help itself with poor shooting in its home finale, however. The Hornets hit on only 37.9 percent of their shots, not nearly enough to keep pace with a Mavericks team that made more than half their attempts. 
 The home team never really gave itself a chance, giving up 62 points in the first half while making only 15 baskets.  
 New Orleans' starters tried, however.  Ryan Anderson  collected a double-double with a team-high 20 points and 12 rebounds while  Robin Lopez  added 10 points and 13 boards.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We're trying to help guys mature and understand there's a responsibility that goes with being an NBA player. This is not AAU or college. This is the big boys' league."  --  Hornets coach  Monty Williams  on his young team's final home game. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  45, 33 -- New Orleans and Dallas took 87 and 86 shots, respectively, Sunday evening. They both hit nine 3-pointers and the Hornets attempted 18 free throws to the Mavericks' eight. But the difference was that Dallas converted its attempts from the floor and New Orleans did not. Dallas made 45 of its shots, 12 more than the Hornets did. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Hornets began the game with a 3-pointer by Anderson. It was the last time New Orleans was on the right side of the score. Former Hornet  Chris Kaman  put back his own missed layup that started a 12-2 Dallas run that set the tone for the game. Dallas went on to outscore the Hornets 33-19 in the first quarter and the Mavericks never were threatened again. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It's an unbelievable accomplishment. When I first got in the league, I didn't know if I could make it here."  --  Dallas' Nowitzki on getting to the 25,000-point mark. 
 
 
 HOT:  Dallas' Marion finished the game 10-for-16, keeping him hot in the month of April. In the past seven games, Marion has connected on 56.7 percent of his shots, scoring in double figures ever game, including 20-plus in four of the past six games. 
 
 NOT:  The Hornets'  Greivis Vasquez  finished the game 5-for-16, not exactly the return to action he was looking for after missing New Orleans' previous game with an ankle injury. He was largely ineffective, likely slowed by the bum right ankle that has bothered him for much of the past three weeks. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Dallas' players who were growing beards all can now shave as they made a pact to grow beards until they reached .500. ... New Orleans played its final home game ever as the Hornets. The franchise will become the Pelicans next season. ... Dallas' bench outscored New Orleans' 44-23. ... New Orleans tied its season-high with 20 offensive rebounds. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Hornets, Wednesday @ Dallas. For the Mavericks, Monday @ Memphis, Tuesday vs. New Orleans.
