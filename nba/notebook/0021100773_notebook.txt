  Notebook: Grizzlies 99, Bucks 95 Posted Sunday April 1, 2012 12:10AM By Rick Braun, for NBA.com THE FACTS: O.J. Mayo  scored 24 points, and all three starting front-court players posted double-doubles in points and rebounds as the Memphis Grizzlies used a substantial rebound margin to beat the Milwaukee Bucks, 99-95 Saturday night at the Bradley Center. Forward  Rudy Gay  had 17 points and 10 rebounds, center  Marc Gasol  added 13 points and 15 rebounds and forward  Marreese Speights  had 10 points and 10 rebounds as the Grizzlies improved to 28-22. Brandon Jennings  led the Bucks with 24 points,  Ersan Ilyasova  had 20 and 16 rebounds and  Drew Gooden  also had 20 points for the Bucks, who have lost three of their last four at home. Milwaukee (24-28) fell 2 1/2 games behind New York for the final Eastern Conference playoff spot QUOTABLE:  "Me, Zach and Marc and all the bigs, we just go and attack the boards. They were playing small, so we knew we had an advantage on the boards. We just went out there and tried to get every rebound."   -- Speights on the Grizzlies' rebounding advantage THE STAT:  The Bucks simply could not keep the bigger Grizzlies off the boards, and Memphis' whopping 58-39 edge on the boards -- including 18-9 on the offensive glass -- was the leading reason for the final result. TURNING POINT:  Despite being well behind on the boards, the Bucks still held a 62-56 lead midway through the third quarter. From there they missed eight straight shots and had three turnovers as the Grizzlies went on a 14-0 run to take a 70-62 lead. The Bucks never got closer than three the rest of the way. QUOTABLE II:  "Hitting the boards and getting those easy little putbacks get us going."   --  Zach Randolph , who had 13 points and seven rebounds -- five offensive -- off the bench HOT:  Although he was just 6 of 15 from the floor, Mayo made all 10 of his free throws, including four in the final 15.8 seconds. NOT:  Bucks guard  Monta Ellis  didn't score from the field until 8:53 was left in the fourth quarter. He finished just 2 of 12 for eight points. BAD MOVE:  The Bucks actually had a chance in the final 20 seconds because the Grizzlies fouled two different shooters outside the 3-point line in a four-second span in the final half-minute.  Tony Allen  fouled Ilyasova with 16.5 seconds left, and Ilyasova made two of the three foul shots to make it 95-92. After Mayo made two free throws with 15.8 seconds left, Gay fouled  Ekpe Udoh  on a 3-pointer with 12.5 seconds left. Udoh made all three shots to make it 97-95. NOTABLE:  Memphis point guard  Mike Conley  did not dress for the game because of a sore right ankle. He wasn't on the team's pre-game injury report and coach  Lionel Hollins  didn't reveal Conley wouldn't play when he met with reporters before the game. ... With Conley out,  Gilbert Arenas  played 16 minutes, 36 seconds and scored four points. ... Jennings missed a breakaway dunk late in the second quarter, but since he was the only player at the end he chased down his own rebound in the corner and turned it into a 3-point play when he was fouled by Gay as he made a jumper from the left wing. ... The Grizzlies missed 11 straight shots and turned the ball over five times in a seven-minute span of the first quarter, but the Bucks only capitalized minimally with an 11-1 run to take a 19-9 lead before Mayo closed the quarter with a driving layup. ... The Bucks are 8-12 in their last 20 home games after starting the season 4-0 at the Bradley Center. ... After a game at Washington on Monday, the Bucks will play their next five at home. UP NEXT:  For the Grizzlies, Monday @ Oklahoma City, Tuesday vs. Golden State, Wednesday @ Dallas. For the Bucks, Monday @ Washington, Wednesday vs. Cleveland, Friday vs. Charlotte.
