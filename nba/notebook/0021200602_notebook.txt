 THE FACTS: Darren Collison  hit a 3-pointer with 31.9 seconds left, joining six Dallas teammates in double figures  to help the Mavericks open the second half of their season with a 111-105 victory over the Orlando Magic Sunday. 
 The Mavericks (18-24) saw a 13-point fourth-quarter lead chopped to two when Collison got open in the corner, took a pass from  Vince Carter  and nailed the jumper to make it 107-102. 
 
 Shawn Marion  led the Mavericks with 20 points and 10 rebounds and Carter came off the bench with 15 points and six assists.  Glen Davis  scored a game-high 24 points and  Jameer Nelson  added 20 for the Magic (14-26), who lost for the 13th time in 15 games.  J.J. Redick  had 18 points including a 3-pointer to cut the Dallas lead back to two after Collison's big shot.  Dirk Nowitzki  and  O.J. Mayo  then clinched the Mavericks' fifth victory in six games with four free throws.  
 
 QUOTABLE : "Biggest play of the game. It was pretty clear at that time we needed to space the floor. Vince [Carter] penetrated and he had three options. Darren [Collison] stepped into that thing with a lot of confidence and he knocked it in. That's a big shot for us, a big shot for him. We really needed that." 
 --Mavericks coach  Rick Carlisle  on Collison's big shot 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "We put ourselves in position where we were a stop away, and they made a shot. Sometimes it's just that simple." 
 -- Magic coach  Jacque Vaughn 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Both teams shot 50 percent or better from the floor. It was the first time that happened all season in a game involving either the Mavericks or the Magic. 
 
 TURNING POINT : After the Mavericks fell behind 18-4, Marion scored six points on a 19-2, four-minute spurt on which Dallas went 9-for-11. 
 
 HOT : After missing eight of their first 10 shots, the Mavericks shot 70 percent (23-for-33) for the rest of the first half. 
 
 QUOTABLE III : "Winning cures a lot. We had a bad atmosphere there for a while when we were losing. The coaches were on the edge and the players were, but when you win it is a lot more fun . . . We had a big week [three wins and an overtime loss] and I think we are only three games out of the eighth spot." 
 -- Dirk Nowitzki 
 
 NOT : Magic guard  Arron Afflalo  shot 5-for-13 and is shooting 39 percent (35-for-90) in his last six games. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT : Still a little slow after missing 27 games while recovering from knee surgery, Nowitzki had 12 points, seven rebounds, four assists and three blocks in 32 minutes. Carlisle said he does not expect him to be in peak form until after the All-Star break. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH: Jae Crowder  hit a big 3-pointer and a spectacular one-hand putback for the Mavericks.  . . .  Mo Harkless  had three dunks and four rebounds for the Magic.  Andrew Nicholson  did not play for only for only the second time this season. 
 
 NOTABLE : It was the ninth game in 16 days for the Mavericks, who will not play again until Friday. . . . The Magic have lost their last seven games against teams currently holding losing records. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Mavericks, Friday vs. San Antonio, Sunday vs. Phoenix, Tuesday (Jan. 29) @ Portland. For the Magic, Tuesday @ Detroit, Thursday vs. Toronto, Sunday vs. Detroit.
