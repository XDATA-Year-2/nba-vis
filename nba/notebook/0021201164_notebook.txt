 THE FACTS:   Josh Smith  recorded a double-double consisting of 28 points and 12 rebounds, leading the Atlanta Hawks to a resounding 124-101 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday night at the Wells Fargo Center. Rookie guard  John Jenkins  scored 21 points while rookie forward  Mike Scott  contributed 17 points.  Al Horford  added 16 while  Jeff Teague  had 13 points and 11 assists. The Hawks snapped a three-game losing streak while improving to 43-36. 
 
 Thaddeus Young  scored 28 points for the Sixers, who dropped to 31-47.  Nick Young  scored 19 points,  Dorell Wright  had 15 and  Jrue Holiday  had 12. The Sixers have lost four of their last five games. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It was just a matter of us tightening up our defense." 
 -- Horford 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Sixers didn't register one blocked shot, the second time that has occurred this season. It also happened against the Los Angeles Clippers on Feb. 11. The Sixers have just 10 blocked shots over the past six games. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Atlanta built a 59-51 halftime advantage and outscored the Sixers 34-22 in the third quarter. Game over. 
 
 HOT:  Jenkins was 8-for-13 and Smith was 11-for-18. Thaddeus Young connected on 14 of his 20 shots. 
 
 NOT:  Holiday started 1-for-9 and finished 4-for-14.  Damien Wilkins  was 0-for-7. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It's not really an excuse." 
 -- Holiday, on the notion that he's tired after 78 games. 
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Smith had 28 points, 12 rebounds, four assists, one steal and one blocked shot. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  There was an announced attendance of 17,178, but there were far fewer people in the seats. There wasn't much buzz for a Sixers team which has already been eliminated from the playoffs. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "I think John (Jenkins) and Mike (Scott) are really starting to find their niche." 
 -- Hawks coach  Larry Drew , on his two rookies combining for 38 points. 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Hawks attacked the basket and got good shots throughout the game. They moved the ball inside and out very well and kept the Sixers off balance. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Even though Holiday struggled with his shot, he could have had the ball in his hands more often. The depleted Sixers looked lost at times in the third quarter. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Jenkins had 21 and Scott had 17 for the Hawks. For the Sixers, forward  Arnett Moultrie  had seven points and seven rebounds while guard  Justin Holiday  was scoreless in 4:54. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Hawks center  Johan Petro  was out for personal reasons. ...  Kyle Korver  has now knocked down a 3-pointer in 71 consecutive games, the fourth-longest streak in NBA history behind  Dana Barros  (89),  Michael Adams  (79) and  Dennis Scott  (78). ... Atlanta outscored the Sixers 52-40 in points in the paint. ... Smith earned his 29th double-double this season. ... Holiday had five turnovers and just one assist. ...  Thaddeus Young  has scored 20 or more points 12 times this season. ... The Sixers are 1-18 when the opponent shoots 50 percent or better. ... The Hawks were 18-for-19 from the free throw line. ... The Hawks are 31-10 when reaching the 100-point plateau. ...  Nick Young  is averaging 13.8 points on 56.3 percent shooting over the past four games. 
 
 NEXT:  For the Hawks, Friday vs. Milwaukee, Tuesday vs. Toronto, Wednesday at New York. For the Sixers, Friday @ Washington, Sunday vs. Cleveland, Monday @ Detroit.
