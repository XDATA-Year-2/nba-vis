 THE FACT:  The Thunder lose for the first time on New Year's Eve (5-1). 
 
 THE LEAD:  In a showdown of two of the Western Conference's top teams, the Portland Trail Blazers dominated the fourth quarter and came back from 16 points down to stun the Oklahoma City Thunder 98-94. 
 
 Kevin Durant  led all scorers with 37 points, but only one of those came in the critical fourth quarter when Durant was 0-for-5. He grabbed a rebound off a missed  Serge Ibaka  shot with his team down by two and the clock counting down from six seconds but his jumper from nine feet out just missed. Durant also grabbed 14 rebounds. 
 
 LaMarcus Aldridge  led Portland with 25 points and also pulled down 14 rebounds. All four of the Trail Blazers' other starters also scored in double figures. Point guard  Damian Lillard  had 21 points and 11 assists.  Wesley Matthews  was solid with 16 points, seven rebounds and seven assists.  
 The Thunder just had two other starters in double digits, Ibaka with 17 points and  Reggie Jackson  with 12.  
 Overall Oklahoma City outshot the Blazers (43.9 percent to 39.6), outrebounded them (52-43), held their 3-point shooters to just 24.2 percent and dominated in the paint (46-28) -- yet still managed to lose. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "That was a terrific win. To get a game like this on the road during a back-to-back against the best team in the league right now. It's a win to be proud of." 
 -- Trail Blazers head coach  Terry Stotts 
 
 
 THE STAT:  In the critical fourth quarter Portland held OKC to just 20.0 percent shooting (5-for-20). Until then the Thunder had shot 51.6 percent. Portland also had eight points in the paint on 4-for-5 shooting, while OKC had six points on 3-for-9. Until then the Thunder had doubled up the Blazers inside. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The fourth quarter was when Portland dominated but things began to go south for Oklahoma City in the third. Defensive intensity wasn't as good as it should have been, allowing Portland to get out in transition. After scoring just 42 points in the first half, the Blazers cranked out 29 in just the third quarter to start whittling away at what had been a 16-point Thunder lead. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "In the first half I thought we were clicking but in the third quarter I didn't think we came out with the right mindset defensively and then we didn't do a good job of making plays late in the game." 
 -- Thunder head coach  Scott Brooks 
 
 
 HOT:  The Blazers started 7-for-9 (77.7 percent). Aldridge started 5-for-6 (10 points). Durant started 5-for-6 (12 points). OKC finished the first quarter at 57.1 percent (12-for-21). Durant was 8-for-12 (22 points) at halftime and 12-for-21 (36 points) after three. 
 
 NOT:  Portland was 1-for-7 (14.7 percent) on threes in the first quarter. After starting the game 7-for-9, Portland went 8-for-34 (23.5 percent) over the next 16 minutes. Durant was 4-for-14 in the second half. OKC shot just 33.3 percent overall and 11.1 percent (1-for-9) on threes in the second half. Aldridge was 4-for-11 in the last 24 minutes. The Thunder had just five assists in the second half. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The 130th consecutive sellout crowd inside Chesapeake Energy Arena and a festive atmosphere with many fans wearing formal New Year's Eve attire and others in party hats. Oklahoma City's downtown celebration was going on about a block from the arena with an estimated 100,000 people ready to ring in a new year. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Late in the first quarter after backup center  Steven Adams  missed a layup and the Thunder then missed a tip, Durant grabbed the rebound, took a couple of dribbles then launched himself for a rim-rattling slam. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Thunder seemed to let a questionable goaltending call on Adams with 9:22 to go in the game rattle them. They missed their next six shots. 
 
 BAD MOVE TOO:   In the closing seconds with the Thunder down by four, backup point guard Reggie Jackson stood beyond the 3-point line and appeared to look off Durant twice. Durant wanted Jackson to pass him the ball, but Jackson instead drove drove to the basket and was fouled. He hit one of the two free throws. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Thunder backup center Steven Adams played almost 20 minutes, scored four points and grabbed three rebounds.  Trail Blazers guard  Allen Crabbe  did not play. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Thunder lost for the first time when playing an opponent that was on the second night of a back-to-back (7-1). 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Trail Blazers: Thursday vs. Charlotte, Saturday vs. Philadelphia, Tuesday @ Sacramento.  For the Thunder: Thursday vs. Brooklyn, Saturday @ Minnesota, Sunday vs. Boston.
