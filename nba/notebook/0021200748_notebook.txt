 THE FACTS: Jrue Holiday  scored 20 points while  Spencer Hawes  scored 17 points and grabbed nine rebounds, leading the Philadelphia 76ers past the Charlotte Bobcats 87-76 Saturday night at the Wells Fargo Center.  Evan Turner  had 16 points and 10 rebounds while second-year forward  Lavoy Allen  was sensational with 14 points and a career-high 22 rebounds. Guard  Jeremy Pargo , who just signed with the team two days ago, had 12 points. The Sixers improved to 22-27 with the victory. 
 
 Ramon Sessions  led the Bobcats with 20 points while  Byron Mullens  had 16 and  Gerald Henderson  13. The Bobcats fell to 11-39, 5-20 on the road and lost their seventh consecutive game. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "All I did was put my hands up and the ball came to me. I didn't do anything special." --  Allen, on his rebounding performance, the most by any Philadelphia player this season. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Sixers outrebounded Charlotte 60-40. In fact, the Sixers had more defensive rebounds (44) than the Bobcats had in total rebounds. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Bobcats hung around and trailed 77-72 late in the fourth quarter. But consecutive jumpers by Hawes and Holiday pushed the Sixers' lead to 81-72 and it was enough to pull away from the feisty Bobcats. 
 
 HOT:  Hawes was 8-for-15 in more than 40 minutes of playing time. He was effective inside and outside. 
 
 NOT:  Mullens was 7-for-19,  Kemba Walker  was 2-for-9 and Ben Gordon missed seven of his 10 shots. The Bobcats shot just 30.7 percent overall -- 27-for-88. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "At this point, we just need to find ways to win." --  Henderson. 
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Allen had 14 points, 22 rebounds (11 off the offensive glass), three assists and one blocked shot. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  There was a nice crowd of 15,048 for this Saturday matchup against the struggling Bobcats. The fans were quiet much of the night until the Sixers pulled away down the stretch. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "That's something we've got to do because it takes a lot of pressure off of us." --   Hawes, on the rebounding differential. 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Sixers coach  Doug Collins  paired the newly-signed Pargo and Holiday for long stretches in the backcourt. Pargo handled the ball quite a bit and allowed Holiday more space to roam. It paid huge dividends on this night. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Bobcats could have gone to Henderson more often. Henderson was getting the shots he wanted and did a great job of drawing contact and going to the free throw line. They went away from Henderson on too many possessions. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Charlotte forward  Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  had two points, two rebounds and two assists in 14:24 while guard  Jeffery Taylor  was scoreless with three rebounds in 9:46. For the Sixers, forward  Arnett Moultrie  had three points and seven rebounds in 13:58. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Sixers were short-handed for Saturday's game against the visiting Charlotte Bobcats. Already without forward  Thaddeus Young  (strained left hamstring), the Sixers learned a day ago that guard  Jason Richardson  is also out for the season with left knee synovitis. ... The Sixers have won five straight over Charlotte. ... The Sixers held the opposition below 90 points for the fifth straight game. ... The last time a Philadelphia player had at least 14 points and 22 rebounds like Allen came when  Samuel Dalembert  had 15 points and 23 rebounds March 20, 2009 at Golden State. Dalembert was also the last Sixer with at least 20 rebounds -- 21 against New York on Jan. 13, 2010. ... Turner recorded his 10th double-double of the season. He had just seven double-doubles in his first two seasons combined. ... Both teams shot 2-for-16 from beyond the arc. ... Pargo picked up a technical foul with 5:31 remaining in regulation. 
 
 NEXT:  For the Bobcats, Monday vs. Boston, Wednesday @ Indiana, Feb. 19 @ Orlando. For the Sixers, Monday vs. L.A. Clippers, Wednesday @ Milwaukee, Feb. 20 @ Minnesota.
