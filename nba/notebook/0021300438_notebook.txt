 THE FACT:  For the second consecutive night, the Toronto Raptors defeated the New York Knicks by double-digits in a key Atlantic match up.  
 
 THE LEAD: Kyle Lowry  scored a game-high 32 points and added a game-high 11 assists, leading the Toronto Raptors (13-15) to a 115-100 victory over the New York Knicks (9-21) Saturday night.  Terrence Ross  made a career-high seven 3-pointers and finished with 23 points, while  DeMar DeRozan  added 20 points for the Raptors.  
 
 Amar'e Stoudemire  came off of the bench to lead the Knicks with 23 points and  Tyson Chandler  chipped in with 16.  Andrea Bargnani , in his return to Toronto (who traded him in the offseason), had 12 points in 17 minutes. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "Since he's been in the league, he's playing at the highest level I have seen. He is playing with such force and such confidence. He's been playing the game the right way and he's been playing lights out." 
 -- Raptors coach  Dwane Casey  on the play of Kyle Lowry 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Raptors starting backcourt outscored the Knicks' 52-11.  Lowry and DeRozan were a combined 17-for-35 and  Iman Shumpert  and  Beno Udrih  combined to shoot just 4-for-8.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  Midway through the second quarter, with the game tied at 34, DeRozan took the ball strong the basket against Bargnani, making the bucket and drawing the foul, igniting a 10-0 Raptor run.  Toronto would finish the quarter on a on a 23-10 run, giving them a 57-44 lead at halftime.  The Knicks would cut into the lead, but never got closer than within six points.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It just showed you we can play with anybody.  That's how we really feel. We have a chance. We are NBA players just like anybody else and we aren't going to look at anybody like they are superior to us." 
 -- Raptors guard DeMar DeRozan 
 
 
 HOT:   Ross made seven of his 11 3-point shots on the night, coming within one point of his season-high point total. The Toronto Raptors were red-hot from beyond the 3-point arc. As a team, they shot a blistering 47 percent (15-for-32).  With the majority of the team struggling on the offensive end, Stoudemire scored 11 of his 23 points in the third quarter for the Knicks, giving them a boost and helping them get back into the game. 
 
 NOT:  Bargnani struggled in his return to Toronto. He was a -13 in his brief appearance. 
 
 NOTABLE:   Knicks forward Bargnani made his regular season return to Toronto for the first time since being traded by the Raptors in July. He played seven seasons with the Toronto and was their first overall pick in the 2006 draft. He was greeted with a chorus of boos every time he touched the ball...  Metta World Peace  and  Carmelo Anthony  did not play for the Knicks... The final attendance for the game was 19,800, a sellout.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Raptors, Tuesday @ Chicago, Wednesday vs. Indiana and Friday @ Washington. For the Knicks, Thursday @ San Antonio, Friday @ Houston and January 5th @Dallas.
