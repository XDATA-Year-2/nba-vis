 THE FACTS:   O.J. Mayo  and  Chris Kaman  combined for 17 of the Mavericks' last 19 points as Dallas held off  Dorell Wright  and the Philadelphia 76ers with a 107-100 win Tuesday at the American Airlines Center. The Mavericks (12-13) snapped a three-game slide and handed the slumping Sixers (12-13) their fourth consecutive defeat. 
 The Mavericks had five in double figures. Mayo tallied 26 points and eight assists and Kaman finished with 20 points and seven rebounds.  Shawn Marion  added 14 points and nine boards,  Darren Collison  chipped in 12 points and  Brandan Wright  had 10 on 5-for-6 shooting. 
 Wright led Philadelphia with a season-high 25 points, including 12 in the fourth quarter.  Spencer Hawes  added 18 off the bench, including the 76ers' first 10 points in the final period.  Evan Turner  (17),  Thaddeus Young  (12) and  Jason Richardson  (11) also scored in double figures. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It's the most important time of the game. It's crunch time, and I was glad I was out there to finish plays and to get a win." 
 -- Mavericks' Kaman on the fourth quarter. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  After averaging 21.3 turnovers during their three-game losing streak, the Mavericks only committed 11. They had zero turnovers in the second quarter and just four in the first half. Dallas finished with a 17-6 advantage in points off turnovers. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  A 14-4 run enabled the Mavericks to build a 94-82 cushion with four minutes remaining, enough to survive a 3-point barrage by Wright (four treys in the final 3:15). 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "This Dallas team's a very good offensive team. They put a lot of pressure on you in a lot of ways, and our weakness they can expose. We just couldn't get the ball stopped and keep it out of the paint at the end of the game." 
 -- Philadelphia head coach  Doug Collins . 
 
 
 HOT:  The Mavericks are 11-1 (8-0 at home) when leading entering the fourth quarter. ... Dallas shot 54.2 percent from the field and 86.2 percent (25-for-29) at the line. 
 
 NOT:  The Sixers are 1-12 (0-6 on the road) when trailing after three quarters. ... Richardson was 1-for-7 from 3-point range. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Mavericks point guard  Derek Fisher  left midway through the first quarter with a strained patellar tendon in his right knee and did not return. There didn't appear to be contact, but he fell to the floor after getting his layup attempt blocked by Turner. He walked to the locker room under his own power. Battling the flu, the 38-year-old Fisher made a surprise appearance in the starting lineup after head coach  Rick Carlisle  said he wasn't going to play. He will have an MRI on Wednesday. "We don't believe it's serious," Carlisle said. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The Mavericks paid a pregame tribute to season-ticket holder  Fisher Floyd , 30, who died last week in a small plane crash. Carlisle, who attended the funeral Tuesday, said he got to know Floyd because he sat behind the team's bench and attended Mavericks fantasy camps. "He was a great guy," Carlisle said. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Sixers guard  Maalik Wayns  was only 1-for-7 from the field (1-for-5 from long distance), but dished a game-high nine assists in 21 minutes off the bench. The undrafted free agent from Villanova entered the night with 11 assists in his first 16 games. 
 
 NOTABLE:  This game began a stretch in which the 76ers play 10 of 11 games on the road, including a season-high eight straight from Dec. 23-Jan. 5. ... Point guard  Jrue Holiday  (sore left foot) missed his third straight game for Philadelphia and Dallas forward  Elton Brand  (right groin strain) did not play against his former team. ... Marion (16,011) became the 95th player in NBA history to reach the 16,000-point plateau. ...  Nick Young  had a four-point play in the first quarter. ... Dallas is 6-0 at home against the Eastern Conference. ... The Mavs have won seven straight at home against Philly. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Thursday vs. Miami, Friday @ Memphis, Sunday @ San Antonio. For the 76ers, Wednesday @ Houston, Friday vs. Atlanta, Sunday @ Brooklyn.
