
 Wizards-Knicks notebook   By Adam Zagoria, for NBA.com Posted Friday November 5, 2010 10:49PM THE FACTS:   Toney Douglas  had a team-high 19 points and 10 rebounds off the bench and  Raymond Felton  added 13 points and 10 assists as the Knicks won their second straight with a 112-91 victory over the Washington Wizards at Madison Square Garden. QUOTABLE:  "We would be 4-2 right now. I'm sticking to my story."  -- Knicks coach  Mike D'Antoni , whose team is 3-2, on the postponement of Tuesday's game with the Orlando Magic because of asbestos-related material at the Garden. THE STAT:  The Knicks took control in the second quarter by outscoring the Wizards 32-22 for a 58-49 halftime lead. Douglas scored nine points in the period and Felton added six. After posting 16 first-quarter points on 7-for-8 shooting, Washington's  JaVale McGee  went 0-for-3 and managed just two points in the second period. TURNING POINT:  After the Wizards cut a 12-point second-half lead to 92-86 on a 3-pointer by  Gilbert Arenas , the Knicks used a 10-4 run -- capped by a short jumper from Douglas -- to go up 102-90. QUOTABLE II:  "I should be coming off the bench for another couple weeks, couple months. When I come off, I just gotta be ready like the Microwave."  -- Gilbert Arenas on scoring 18 points on 6-for-13 shooting HOT:  Douglas has scored 49 points, including a career-high 30 in Thursday's win at Chicago, in two nights and  Danilo Gallinari  40. Gallinari followed his season-high 24-point outing against the Bulls with 16 against the Wizards. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Comedian Chris Rock and Red Bulls star Thierry Henry. Henry is friends with fellow Frenchman and Knicks center Ronny Turiaf. ROOKIE WATCH:  Coming off his 29-point, 13-assist performance in Tuesday's win over Philadelphia, Wizards guard  John Wall  struggled with 13 points on 4-for-11 shooting, nine turnovers and seven assists. NOTABLE:  There were a bunch of sweet dunks in this one, including a reverse slam by  Wilson Chandler  in the first half and a couple of posterizing flushes by  Bill Walker  in the second. UP NEXT:  For the Knicks, Sunday vs. Philadelphia, Tuesday @ Milwaukee, Wednesday vs. Golden State. For the Wizards, Saturday vs. Cleveland, Wednesday vs. Houston, Friday vs. Charlotte.
