
 Kings-Mavericks notebook   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday February 16, 2011 11:35PM THE FACTS:  The long-range marksmanship of veteran  Jason Kidd  and the breathtaking coast-to-coast drives of youngster  Rodrigue Beaubois  fueled the Mavericks' 116-100 defeat of the visiting Kings on Wednesday. Kidd was 6-for-7 from 3-point range and scored a team-high 20 points and Beaubois, making his much-anticipated season debut after recovering from a broken left foot, added 13 points, six assists and three steals. Sacramento, playing without leading scorer  Tyreke Evans , dropped its ninth straight meeting with the Mavericks and its 14th straight in Dallas. QUOTABLE:  "I don't know if I envisioned eight guys in double figures, but we wanted to win the game. It's always good when you can keep the minutes reasonable heading into a back-to-back, so those were positives."   -- Mavericks head coach  Rick Carlisle , whose team has won 12 of its last 13 games. THE STAT:  The Mavericks have had at least five players score in double figures in 12 straight games. Dallas is 26-4 this season when that happens. Eight players reached twin digits against the Kings. In addition to Kidd and Beaubois, the others were:  Shawn Marion  (14),  Dirk Nowitzki  (13),  Brendan Haywood  (13 points, 10 rebounds),  Peja Stojakovic  (12),  Jason Terry  (12) and  J.J. Barea  (11 points, 10 assists). The bench outscored Sacramento's reserves 62-33. TURNING POINT:  After Sacramento had suddenly erased a 13-point halftime deficit, Dallas came alive and buried the Kings with a trifecta-fueled, 24-4 third-quarter blitz. Kidd's fourth 3-pointer of the run gave the Mavericks a 94-74 lead with 1:11 remaining in the period. Stojakovic and Beaubois each buried a 3-pointer during that surge. QUOTABLE II:  "The foot is good. I have to get my legs into it. The cardio is kind of tough. It's been a long time, but I have to keep working on it."   -- Rodrigue Beaubois, who was sidelined for the first 54 games of the season. HOT:  Dallas shot a season-high 55.6 percent from the field, including 50 percent (13-for-26) from behind the arc. The Mavericks outscored the Kings by a 54-34 margin in the paint and also set a season high with 34 assists, topping the previous mark of 31 set against New Jersey on Dec. 9. NOT:  Both teams were sloppy with the basketball. Dallas scored 38 points off 26 turnovers by the Kings, who scored 24 points off a season high-tying 21 miscues by the Mavericks. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Starting for Evans (plantar fasciitis, left foot),  Jermaine Taylor  scored a career-high 17 points to lead the Kings. He added five assists, four steals and three boards and was 3-for-6 from downtown. Taylor scored 12 in the first period and had tied his previous high of 15 by the 9:16 mark of the second quarter. BAD MOVE:  Reserve Mavericks center  Ian Mahinmi  managed to pick up six fouls in just 7:23. Dallas was whistled for 26 fouls in the game, compared to just 14 for Sacramento. The Kings were 26-for-34 at the line and the Mavs were 3-for-6 (season lows for free throws made and attempted). ROOKIE WATCH:  Sacramento's  DeMarcus Cousins  collected his seventh double-double in his last nine games with 16 points, 12 rebounds, four assists, three steals and two blocked shots. On the negative side, he was 6-for-19 from the field with seven turnovers. NOTABLE:  The Kings are 1-6 without Evans in the lineup this season. ... The Mavericks are 28-2 when scoring 100 points and have reached the century mark in 11 of their last 12 games. ... The Mavericks' current seven-game home streak matches their longest of the season (Nov. 23-Dec. 11). UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Thursday @ Phoenix, Wednesday vs. Utah, Feb. 26 @ Washington. For the Kings, Tuesday @ Miami, Wednesday @ Orlando, Feb. 25 @ Charlotte.
