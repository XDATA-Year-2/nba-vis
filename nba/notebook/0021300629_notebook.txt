 THE FACT:  The Indiana Pacers finished the first half of their season at 33-8, the NBA's best record  by 1.0 games over Oklahoma City. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Nevada sports books pegged the Phoenix Suns as about a 20-win team before the NBA season started.  
 On Wednesday night, the Suns rolled up win No. 24. And their season is only halfway finished. 
 Moreover, the win was their season's biggest, a rousing 124-100 blowout over the visiting Pacers.  
 The game was a chance for  Gerald Green  and  Miles Plumlee , who were buried at the end of the Pacers' bench last season, to show their stuff. They were acquired by the Suns' in an off-season trade that sent  Luis Scola  to Indiana. 
 The two came through in a big way, leading a running, dunking and long-range shooting display that the vaunted Pacers' defense was unable to control. 
 They did so even with Green (23 points) and  Goran Dragic  (21 points in 22 minutes) on the bench most of the second half, in part because of foul trouble for Dragic, and then because the Pacers had thrown in the towel. 
 The Pacers brought their deep reserves off the bench with 6:06 left and the Suns leading, 109-83. 
 For the Pacers, who had their five-game win streak broken, Paul George put up 26 points. 
 For the Suns, Plumlee had 11 points and seven rebounds and controlled the paint defensively.  Markieff Morris  had 20 points.  
 The Suns (24-17) pulled ahead 44-31 at the start of the second quarter, maintained the same 13-point margin (62-49) at halftime, then then outscored the Pacers 10-2 to start the second half -- Plumlee started the run with a tip-in -- to take a 72-51 lead. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We knew how good they are. We knew we had to come out with that kind of energy....Confidence-wise, this is a big deal."  --  Plumlee on the Suns' big win 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Suns are 5-5 vs. the NBA's division leaders, including 4-1 at home.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Suns, leading 30-29, got 3-pointers from  Channing Frye  and Green en route to a 14-2 run to start the second quarter to open a 44-31 lead. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "Not at all. We drafted him knowing he would be this player. We didn't want to give him up. We always felt he would be a productive player."  --  Pacers coach  Frank Vogel  on how he's not surprised by the rise of the Suns' Plumlee 
 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "I'd like it if they played like that all the time....My guys played great. They played for all 48 minutes...If we can find a way to bottle this game, we'll take it."  --  Suns coach  Jeff Hornacek 
 
 
 QUOTABLE IV:  "This is my seventh team. I've been down this road before."  --  Green on whether he was energized to play his former team 
 
 
 HOT:  The Suns shot 11-for-16 on 3-pointers. 
 
 NOT:  The game wasn't exactly a free-throw clinic, as the teams combined to miss 18 at the line. 
 
 GOOD MOVE : Hornacek limited his players to no more than 31 minutes (Frye). Plumlee played 30 minutes; he played 55 minutes all of last season for the Pacers.  
 
 NOTABLE : This is the Suns' best record at the midpoint since they also went 24-17 four seasons ago, in 2009-10, when they ended up making a surprise run to the Western Conference finals....The Suns' 124 points were the most the Pacers have given up this season....The Suns have won each of their last seven games when Green scores 20-plus points....Pacers forward  David West  suffered a hand injury seven minutes into the game. West returned with a hand brace in the second quarter....The Suns are 27-12 all time vs. the Pacers; they've won 11 of their last 14 games against them at home. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Pacers, Friday @ Sacramento, Saturday @ Denver and Tuesday @ Los Angeles Lakers. For the Suns, Friday vs. Wizards, Sunday @ Cleveland and Monday @ Philadelphia.
