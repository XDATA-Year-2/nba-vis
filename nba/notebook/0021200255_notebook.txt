 THE FACTS:  After trailing the Phoenix Suns by as many as 16 points in regulation Tuesday,  Zach Randolph  put the Memphis Grizzlies on his back and carried them to a 108-98 overtime victory Tuesday night at FedExForum. Randolph finished with season highs of 38 points and 22 rebounds, helping the Grizzlies outscore the Suns 14-4 in the extra session. The come-from-behind win kept the Grizzlies (13-3)  in first place in the Southwest Division.  Goran Dragic's  19 points led six Suns (7-12) in double figures. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  " He reminded me of two years ago Zach. He had the little bounce. He doesn't get high [off the ground], but you could see it in his eyes. He had the eyebrow and all that going. It was good. He was aggressive. He wasn't settling as much as he's been in the past. "  
 --  Grizzlies forward  Marc Gasol  on Randolph's monster game 
 
 THE STAT:  Phoenix shot 49.4 percent in regulation. In overtime, however, the Suns couldn't buy a bucket, going 0-of-5. Phoenix got all four of its overtime points from the line. Meanwhile, Randolph was 3-of-3 from the field in the extra period for six points. He also grabbed five rebounds in the overtime. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  With 1:10 left in regulation, Memphis took its first lead since early in the first quarter on a free throw by  Mike Conley . Though the Suns retook the lead, forward  Rudy Gay  knocked down a 12-footer with 15.9 seconds left to help send the game into overtime. From there, it was all Randolph.   
 
 HOT:  Randolph went 15-of-22, and 8-of-8 from the free-throw line. His season-high 22 rebounds were just 10 fewer than Phoenix tallied as a team. It was Randolph's NBA-best 14th double-double of the season.  
 
 NOT:  Conley struggled for most of the game, shooting 2-of-9. But his 3-pointer to start overtime came as a shot in the arm for Memphis at a key point. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  " That's just me. When I got that little hop in my step, it means I'm going. He knows me and he knows when I'm going. " 
 --  Randolph on Gasol's comment about his hop 
 
 NOTABLE:  Randolph's previous season high was 20 points (twice), the most recent coming on Nov. 16 in a 105-95 win over New York. His previous season high for rebounds was 18. Randolph's career highs are 43 points (vs. Memphis as a Portland Trail Blazer in March 2007) and 25 rebounds (vs. New York in Feb. 2010). ... Though Phoenix's bench outscored Memphis', 46-24, the Grizzlies got a season-high 16 points off the bench from guard  Quincy Pondexter . ... The Suns wrapped up a season-long six-game road trip with the loss Tuesday. Phoenix went 1-5 on the trip.
