 THE FACTS: Mickael Pietrus, Jose Calderon, Alan Anderson  and  Terrence Ross  made 3-point shots during an early 30-7 run and the Toronto Raptors went on to a 123-88 rout of the Orlando Magic. 
 The Raptors (11-20) made nine of their first 10 3-point shots in building a 21-point lead in the first half. 
 
 DeMar DeRozan  led six Raptors in double figures with 21 points. 
 Rookie  Andrew Nicholson  scored a game-high 22 points in his second start for the Magic, who never got the lead under 11 in the second half. 
 Their fifth straight loss dropped the Magic to 12-18. 
 The Raptors have won seven of their last eight games, including two victories against the Magic. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Everybody on this team is hungry. We had a lot of bad luck early in the season with injuries and close games that we should have won. It's desperation time so every time we step out onto the court, we're going to play like it's our last game."  --  DeRozan. 
 
 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We were in a 4 1/2-foot hole; now we're in a 3 1/2-foot hole trying to crawl our way out." --  Raptors coach  Dwane Casey. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Raptors shot 15-for-27 (56 percent) from behind the 3-point line. It was only the sixth time they have made as many as 15 3-pointers in a game without going into overtime, the most recent coming on Jan. 23, 2008 against Boston. They won all six games. 
 
 TURNING POINT:   The Magic led, 19-16, when Pietrus made a 3-pointer with 4:21 left in the first quarter, launching the 30-7 Toronto spurt over the next seven minutes.  
 
 HOT:  Every Toronto player who took a minimum of three shots made at least half of them, and the Raptors shot 56 percent overall. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "It's about sharing the ball and finding the wide-open guy. We know if we make that extra pass, then the next play will result in that guy making the extra pass. It's about trust. We have to get the selfishness out of our team." --  Jose Calderon , who had 10 of Toronto's 33 assists. 
 
 
 NOT:  J.J. Redick  shot 2-for-12 and missed several long jumpers while the Magic were still in the game. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  DeRozan, who went into the game tied for 20th in the NBA in scoring, is averaging 24.8 points in his last five games. 
 
 HARD TIMES:  Four days ago, the Magic looked ahead to consecutive games against teams (Hornets, Wizards, Raptors) with a combined record of 17-63. They lost all three.  
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Nicholson, a late insertion into the starting lineup, had the highest scoring output of his 29-game career. Fellow-Magic rookie  Maurice Harkless  was shut out for the fourth time in his 20 starts.  
 
 NOTABLE:  In the absence of  Jameer Nelson  (hip) and  Glen Davis  (shoulder), the Magic used their 11th different starting lineup . . .  Hedo Turkoglu  played for the first time since opening day for the Magic. He scored eight points in 23 minutes . . . Eleven of the 13 Raptors who played had at least one assist . . . In their 24 seasons, the Magic have lost only three home games by 35 points or more. Two of those losses have come this season. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Raptors: Wednesday vs. Portland, Friday vs. Sacramento, Sunday vs. Oklahoma City. For the Magic: Monday vs. Miami, Wednesday vs. Chicago, Saturday vs. New York.
