 THE FACTS: Thaddeus Young  scored 23 points and tied his career high with 15 rebounds as the Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Sacramento Kings 89-80 Friday night at the Wells Fargo Center.  Jrue Holiday  scored 21 points,  Nick Young  had 20 and  Spencer Hawes  10 for the Sixers (20-26), who won consecutive games for the first time since a three-game streak from Nov. 25-30. 
 
 Tyreke Evans  led the Kings with 29 points while  Isaiah Thomas  contributed 24.  DeMarcus Cousins  had 12 points and 12 rebounds. The Kings (17-31) fell to 5-19 on the road. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "It's a good win for us. We'll take it and try to go get the next game." 
 -- Thaddeus Young 
 
 THE STAT : The Kings shot 3-for-18 overall, and 0-for-3 from beyond the arc, in the fourth quarter. They managed just 12 points in the fourth after mounting a huge comeback to take a short-lived one-point lead. 
 
 TURNING POINT : After the Kings rallied from 19 down to take a 73-72 lead, the Sixers came right back with a 10-0 run to go ahead 82-73. The Sixers have had trouble holding leads all season, but on this night, they wouldn't allow the Kings to make one last surge. 
 
 HOT : Thaddeus Young was 11-for-17 and Holiday knocked down nine of his 17 shots. 
 
 NOT: Jason Thompson  was 3-for-9,  John Salmons  was 1-for-7 and  Francisco Garcia  misfired on all three of his shots in 20:25 off the bench for the Kings. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "We sure don't make anything easy." 
 -- Sixers coach  Doug Collins 
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT : Thaddeus Young had 23 points, 15 rebounds, two assists and two steals. For the Kings, Thomas was solid throughout with 24 points, five assists, four rebounds and one steal. Thomas also was 10-for-10 from the free-throw line. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA : The crowd of 17,927 was relatively quiet for much of the game. That is, until the Sixers let a 19-point lead dissipate early in the fourth. From there, the fans responded and the buzz could be felt throughout the arena. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "As far as our effort, we played good. We never gave up." 
 -- Tyreke Evans 
 
 GOOD MOVE : Thaddeus Young was a force in the paint all game and the Sixers kept going to him. They did a very good job of recognizing that Young could score at will in the paint against the Kings, who had no answer for the lanky forward's variety of moves. 
 
 BAD MOVE : The Kings settled for far too many jump shots. Cousins only had three free-throw attempts, which is not nearly enough. As an aside, he missed all three of those shots. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH : Kings forward  Thomas Robinson  was scoreless with two rebounds in 6:34. For the Sixers, forward  Arnett Moultrie  received a DNP-CD. 
 
 NOTABLE : Sixers guard  Jason Richardson  missed his fifth straight game with left knee synovitis. Richardson traveled to Colorado for a second opinion and there is no immediate timetable for his return. ... Sacramento forward  James Johnson  was active but didn't play because of an illness. ... The Kings have dropped six of its last seven games. ... Thaddeus Young registered his 12th double-double of the season. He had just one all of last season. It's the third time that Young had at least 20 points and 14 rebounds. That's the most games in a single season by a Philadelphia player since  Chris Webber  did it seven times in 2005-06. ... Cousins picked up a technical foul with 2:12 left in the third. It was his 10th technical of the season. ... Sixers forward  Evan Turner  also got a technical with 11:14 remaining in the third. ... The Sixers committed 20 turnovers and had 20 assists. ... Nick Young is averaging 18.2 points over the last five games. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Kings, Saturday @ New York, Monday @ Utah, Friday vs. Utah. For the Sixers, Monday vs. Orlando, Wednesday vs. Indiana, Saturday vs. Charlotte.
