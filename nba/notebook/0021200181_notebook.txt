 THE FACTS: Markief Morris  capped a career-high 23 points Friday night in only his second start of the season with a 3-pointer in overtime for a 111-108 victory over the Hornets in a wild, back-and-forth game at US Airways Center in downtown Phoenix. 
 The Suns (6-7) stormed back from a 19-point third-quarter deficit, only to see the Hornets (3-8) tie it in regulation at 103 apiece with eight successive points during a 58.2-second blitz that included  Ryan  Anderson's  eighth 3-point goal on a night when he had 34 points, also a career-high. 
 The Hornets were within three with 3.6 seconds left in the extra period after  Greivis Vasquez  hit jumper initially scored as a 3-pointer. After a review, officials ruled Vasquez had stepped inside the 3-point line. 
 With 4.9 seconds left and the Suns holding onto a three-point edge,  P.J. Tucker  muscle his way to an offensive rebound of a miss by  Jermaine O'Neal , who came off the bench for 11, 2 blocks and 13 points. Tucker was fouled. He sank both the subsequent free throws, saving a victory for the Suns on a night when they staged a 31-7 run that started with 4:23 left in the third quarter and ended with them leading by 11 with 6:37 left in regulation.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I've never seen anybody shoot like that, to be honest with you. That was  Larry Bird -like, if you ask me.'' -- Suns coach  Alvin Gentry,  on Anderson, who was 13-for-23 from the floor, including 8-for-13 from the 3-point distance. 
 
 THE STAT:  The Hornets committed 19 turnovers, 11 after the first half. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  On a night when there could have been several, there were two: First, Morris' 3-pointer from the top of the arc with 49.9 seconds left and then Tucker's offensive rebound with 4.9 seconds left. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I can't say enough about P.J. Tucker. He epitomizes what we want our team to be.'' -- Gentry. 
 
 HOT:  Vazquez nearly stole one on the road for the Hornets with 14 assists and 25 points on 10-for-13 shooting.  
 
 NOT:  Suns forward  Michael Beasley  continues to struggle. He had one rebounds and only two points on 1-for-6 shooting. His night was finished when he was pulled from the lineup for O'Neal with 7:50 left in the third quarter. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Gentry's decision to go with O'Neal instead of Beasley down the stretch. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Suns inability to deny Anderson the ball with 1:16 left in regulation. 
 
 IN THE ARENA:  A sparse crowd, announced at 14,060, wanted to boo Hornets center  Robin Lopez , who was back in US Airways Center for the first time since he left the Suns. The boos were as sparse as the crowd. Lopez was never much of a factor with eight points and seven rebounds. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Gentry didn't play Suns guard Kendall Marshall, a lottery pick from North Carolina, for the third straight game 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Suns point guard  Goran Dragic  strung together numbers that added up to efficiency -- 20 points, 7-for-14 shooting, eight assists and three steals. He had three turnovers, half of Vasquez' total of six.  
 
 NOTABLE:  Tucker hit two 3-pointer, or one more than he has in his career. He was 2-for-4 from the college 3-point line at Texas. ...Hornets forward  Jason Smith  suffered a corneal abrasion with 3:11 in the first quarter. He did not return. ...The Suns comeback after being down 19 points was their fourth double-digit comeback this season. They won for the first time when trailing after three quarters. ...O'Neal came off the bench for his fourth successive game with double-digit scoring, his longest streak since the 2009-2010 season. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Hornets: Sunday @ Denver, Monday @ Clippers and Wednesday vs. Jazz. For the Suns: Sunday @ Philadelphia, Tuesday @ Cleveland and Wednesday @ Detroit.
