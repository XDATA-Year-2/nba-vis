 THE FACTS: Matt Barnes  scored 21 points off the bench, and  Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan  and  Chris Paul  all posted double-doubles as the Los Angeles Clippers cruised to their ninth straight victory, a 111-85 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks Saturday night in Milwaukee. 
 Griffin had 18 points and 11 rebounds, Jordan posted 15 points and 11 rebounds and Paul had 10 points and 13 assists as the Clippers improved to 17-6. 
 
 Marquis Daniels  had 16 points to lead the Bucks (12-10), who had a four-game winning streak snapped. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I think we're playing with a lot of confidence right now, but the biggest thing is that we're just trying to make sure we play the game the right way. Me and  Caron Butler  were just talking about it. We understand that at some point we will lose a game, but as long as we play the right way and don't get too upset and start pointing fingers and things like that, we'll be OK." 
 
 -- Paul on whether the Clippers have developed a mindset that if they're on their game they won't be beaten 
 
 
 THE STATS:  The Clippers hammered the Bucks 31-8 in fast-break points, 33-15 in assists and 66-28 in points in the paint. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Bucks center  Larry Sanders  was unable to convert a lob dunk that could have pulled Milwaukee within 12-11 midway through the first quarter. Paul came to the other end and made a 3-pointer to make it 15-9, and the Clippers never led by less than six from there. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We really passed the ball well tonight. If we can pass like that to each other throughout the season, we'll be alright. ... Every game is going to be different depending on how guys are playing and personnel and matchups, but there's no reason why Blake and I can't do that every game." 
 
 -- Jordan 
 
 
 HOT:  Barnes was 8-for-10 for his 21 points and always seemed to be a step ahead of whoever was guarding him. 
 
 NOT:  Eight of the nine Bucks players who took a shot in the first half shot under 50 percent, with only  Ekpe Udoh  (1-for-1) making as many or more than he missed. The Bucks shot just 26.2 percent (11-for-42) on their way to a 55-35 deficit. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  With the game well in hand one game left in a four-game road trip, Clippers coach  Vinny Del Negro  had no reason to overtax his starters. Griffin's 27:29 were the most minutes played among the first five. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Bucks second-round pick  Doron Lamb  entered the game having missed his last 13 shots and missed his first five to make it an 0-for-18 skid before banking in a running shot with 27.7 seconds left in the half. Lamb finished with eight points on 3-for-11 shooting.  
 
 NOTABLE:  Bucks sixth man  Mike Dunleavy  missed his seventh game in the last eight with a bruised knee, and backup point guard  Beno Udrih  missed his eighth straight with a sprained ankle. Dunleavy said after the game he hopes to return in the upcoming week. ... The Clippers' nine-game winning streak is the longest in franchise history since the Buffalo Braves won 11 straight early in the 1974-'75 season. ... The Clippers posted 33 assists to just 15 for the Bucks. ... The Bucks host Indiana on Tuesday, the first time in more than a month they'll play consecutive home games. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Clippers, Monday @ Detroit, Wednesday vs. New Orleans, Friday vs. Sacramento. For the Bucks, Tuesday vs. Indiana, Wednesday @ Memphis, Friday @ Boston.
