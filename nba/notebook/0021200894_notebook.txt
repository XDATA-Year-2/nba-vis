 THE FACTS: LaMarcus Aldridge  led seven players in double figures with 23 points as Portland handled Charlotte 122-105 Monday night at the Rose Garden. Aldridge also had 14 rebounds, five assists and three blocked shots for the Trail Blazers (28-31), who shot a season-best 59.8 percent from the field and were 12-for-24 from 3-point range.   Ramon Sessions  scored 18 points on 8-for-11 shooting and  Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  collected 17 points and 10 rebounds for the Bobcats (13-47), who lost their seventh straight game. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We shouldn't have beat them the last time we played them. Our antennas were up. Everybody was prepared to play. We knew we were capable of losing this game because of the type of team they are. They play hard, they have guys who can score -- it's the NBA. You can get beat any game."  
 
 -- Portland's  Damian Lillard , referring to the Blazers' 118-112 overtime win at Charlotte on Dec. 3.  
 
 
 THE STAT:  The game was won at the 3-point line. Portland was 12-for-24, Charlotte 1-for-10. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Blazers led 41-37 early in the second quarter, then outscored the Bobcats 25-14 over the next six minutes to go in front 66-51. The visitors never got closer than nine points the rest of the way.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We just couldn't stop them from scoring. I felt like we scored enough points to win, but we couldn't match them with their 3s. That's a lot of points to score."  
 
 -- Charlotte's  Gerald Henderson 
 
 
 HOT:  Portland's  Nicolas Batum  started the game 6-for-6, including 4-for-4 from 3-point range. He finished with 8-for-11 shooting for 20 points. 
 
 NOT:  Charlotte's  Kemba Walker  finished 5-for-20 from the field, but he was 2-for-16 until late in the game. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  On a three-on-one fast break late in the third quarter, Lillard made a behind-the-back bounce pass to Batum, who drew the defender, then tossed to  Meyers Leonard  for a dunk. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  In the first quarter, Batum took a breakaway pass from  Eric Maynor . With Charlotte's Sessions in pursuit, Batum tossed the ball off the backboard into the hands of a trailing Meyers Leonard, who dunked. Coach  Terry Stotts  shook his head in disapproval along the Portland sideline. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "Coach goes, 'Don't.' He told me, 'You're lucky on this one. Good thing it worked. Next time I'll kill you.'"  
 
 -- Batum, on Stotts' reaction to his pass off the glass to Leonard for a dunk
