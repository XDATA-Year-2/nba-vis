 THE FACT:  The Sacramento Kings snapped a five game losing streak and improved to 2-5 on the season tonight at the expense of the Brooklyn Nets. Brooklyn has now lost all four of their road games on the season. 
 
 THE LEAD:  The Sacramento Kings picked up a desperately needed win tonight, snapping their five game losing streak with a 107-86 win over the Brooklyn Nets. 
 
 Greivis Vasquez  ran the Kings offense to perfection, scoring 17 points and handing out 12 assists in the win.   Marcus Thornton  found new life off the Kings bench, dropping in a game-high 24 points on 4-for-9 shooting from 3-point range.   Isaiah Thomas  added 19 points, six rebounds and six assists in 26 minutes of action for Sacramento. 
 
 Brook Lopez  scored 16 points and grabbed nine rebounds to anchor the Brooklyn frontline.  Deron Williams  added 13 points and seven assists, while  Shaun Livingston  kicked in 13 off the Nets bench.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I just kept pounding in my head -- just go out there and play and relax.  Shots started falling.  Things happen.  I guess it went my way tonight."   
 --Marcus Thornton 
 
 THE STAT:  Sacramento finished the game with 26 assists and only seven total turnovers in the win. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  This one was over early. The Kings led by 12 at the half and extend that to as many as 23 on the night.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "For us to win, it starts on the defensive end of the floor.  And when we defend, we rebound, we get out and run and we share the ball, we're a decent basketball team."   
 --Sacramento Kings coach  Michael Malone  
 
 
 HOT:  After losing his starting job six games into the season, Thornton came off the Kings bench with energy.  The veteran shooting guard led the way for the Kings, scoring 24 points on 10-for-19 shooting. 
 
 NOT:  The Nets came out flat, shooting just 31-for-82 on the night for a sub-par 37.8 percent. Rookie  Ben McLemore  got his first NBA start tonight against the Nets and threw up a dud. The seventh overall selection in the 2013 NBA Draft scored two points on 1-for-8 shooting in 15 minutes.  
 
 GOOD MOVE:  With McLemore struggling, coach Malone handed the ball back to Thornton and the veteran responded.  
 
 NOTABLE: Kevin Garnett  played his 1,330 career game, surpassing  Moses Malone  for sole possession of 10th place on the NBA's all-time games played list ...  DeMarcus Cousins  scored 15 points and grabbed nine rebounds in 22 minutes tonight, before fouling out with 3:59 remaining in the fourth.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Nets, Friday @ Suns, Saturday @ Clippers, Monday vs. Portland. For the Kings, Friday vs. Detroit, Sunday vs. Memphis, Tuesday vs. Phoenix.
