 THE FACT:  Until  Miles Plumlee 's performance Monday night, the Phoenix Suns hadn't had a 20-rebound performance since  Amar'e Stoudemire  had 21 boards vs. Sacramento on Dec. 5, 2009. 
 
 THE LEAD:  The Suns look in their rear-view mirror and see the .500 mark getting smaller and smaller. In fact, it's almost disappeared. 
 They moved to 17-10 at almost exactly the one-third mark of the NBA season Monday night by rolling to an easy 117-90 win over the injury-depleted Los Angeles Lakers.  
 
 Pau Gasol  returned to action for the visiting Lakers (13-15) after a one-game absence because of a respiratory infection. But Gasol was dominated by Plumlee, the Suns' rising presence in the middle. 
 Plumlee had 17 points and a career-high 20 boards in 31 minutes while Gasol had 10 points and four rebounds in 20 minutes. 
 
 Gerald Green  added 22 points on just 13 shots (including 6-for-11 on 3-pointers).  
 Green and Plumlee were acquired in a trade with Indiana in the offseason (the Suns dealt  Luis Scola ) that appears to be remaking the Suns' franchise. 
 Also,  Eric Bledsoe  had 16 points, a season-high 11 boards and seven assists. 
 For the Lakers,  Nick Young  had 19 points, but shot just 6-for-17.  
 The Suns outrebounded the Lakers 62-39. The 62 boards is the most for a Suns team since they had 67 at Dallas on Feb. 17, 1998. 
 The Suns' 27-point margin was their season's largest. They have won eight of their past nine games.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "For everything that shows up on the stat sheet, I think that it was definitely my best game. It's exciting because I know I can do better."  
 -- Miles Plumlee 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Suns were plus-35 points with Plumlee on the floor. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Suns were struggling, leading just 49-44 in the final minutes of the first half. Then they took off on a 15-7 run to close the half for a 64-51 lead. Included were a trio of 3-pointers by  Marcus Morris , Green and Bledsoe.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "When he's shooting with confidence, we all feel he is going to make every shot, even the wild ones he may take; we still think they're going in."  
 -- Suns coach  Jeff Hornacek  on Green 
 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "I got the easiest job in the world ... shoot the ball."  
 -- Gerald Green on his role with the Suns 
 
 
 HOT:  Plumlee shot 8-for-14 from the floor. 
 
 NOT:  The Lakers missed 13 of 37 free throws. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  For the Lakers, Ryan Kelly had three points in nine minutes. For the Suns,  Archie Goodwin  shot 2-for-8 for five points in 17 minutes. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Green, the Suns' designated gunner, is most certainly out of a recent shooting slump. Over the past three games, he's shot 19-for-35 (16-for-31 on 3-pointers) for 63 points (a 21.0 average). 
 
 NOTABLE: Jordan Farmar  could return Wednesday, vs. Miami, giving the Lakers an experienced point guard. He has been out with a left hamstring problem. The Lakers signed  Kendall Marshall  as an emergency replacement, but he has only played twice (for about 10 minutes) in three games so far. Marshall shot 0-for-1 for zero points in four minutes vs. the Suns.  Steve Nash  and  Steve Blake , their top two point guards, remain out. ... The Suns rank No. 2 in the NBA with 9.7 makes per game on 3-pointers. They rank No. 6 in 3-point percentage at 38.1. They rank No. 4 by making 45.9 percent on corner 3-point tries. ... In a rivalry that dates to 1968, the Suns have won five straight at home vs. the Lakers.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Lakers, Wednesday vs. Miami, Friday @ Utah, Sunday vs. Philadelphia. For the Suns, Friday @ Golden State, Saturday vs. Philadelphia, Monday @ L.A. Clippers.
