  Notebook: Mavs 106, Spurs 99 Posted Sunday March 18, 2012 12:21AM By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  Despite playing without two injured starters, the Dallas Mavericks never trailed Saturday in a 106-99 victory over the rival San Antonio Spurs at the American Airlines Center.  Dirk Nowitzki  scored a game-high 27 points and  Jason Kidd  had 14 points and 10 assists as Dallas won its third straight and snapped San Antonio's three-game winning streak. Center  Brendan Haywood  and forward  Shawn Marion  were both inactive, but the Mavericks made up for their absences with contributions up and down the roster.  Jason Terry  scored 17 off the bench, eight in the fourth quarter.  Rodrigue Beaubois  had 16 points and a career high-tying eight rebounds.  Vince Carter  had 10 points and backup centers  Ian Mahinmi  and  Brandan Wright  combined for 15 points and 17 boards. Tim Duncan  and  Danny Green  led the Spurs with 17 points each.  Tiago Splitter  scored 15 and  Tony Parker  registered his eighth double-double with 13 points and 11 assists. San Antonio, coming off a big win Friday at Oklahoma City, fell to 6-5 this season in the second half of back-to-backs. QUOTABLE:  "Everybody stepped up. Everybody came to play tonight. We knew how important this game is. As the season is getting closer to the end, we've got to play better basketball. Tonight is a perfect example of that."   -- Jason Kidd THE STAT:  This was the first double-double of the season for Kidd, 38, who ranks third among all active NBA players with 486 career double-doubles. TURNING POINT:  The Mavericks opened up a 14-point lead in the fourth quarter with a 10-1 run that featured a dunk by Wright, back-to-back 3-pointers by Kidd and Nowitzki, and a jumper by Beaubois to make it 92-78 with 6:03 remaining. QUOTABLE II:  "I just think that their team in general was a lot sharper overall than we were. We were half a step behind most of the night, defensively for sure, and they took advantage of it. They shot the ball well. They moved it well. They did a good job."   -- San Antonio head coach  Gregg Popovich HOT:  Both teams were exactly 11-for-24 from 3-point distance (45.8 percent). Kidd was 4-for-5 and Terry was 3-for-4 for the Mavericks. Green and  Gary Neal  were both 3-for-4 for the Spurs. NOT:  San Antonio was 10-for-18 at the foul line (4-for-11 in the first half), compared to the Mavericks' 21-for-25 effort. ...  Lamar Odom  was 1-for-7 from the field and has shot just 17.4 percent (4-for-23) in his last four games. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  After scoring just 16 combined points in the first two meetings this season against the Spurs, Nowitzki had 19 in the first half (including the Mavericks' final 12 points of the half). He was 8-for-25 from the floor in the first two games and 9-for-19 in this one. He was 7-for-7 at the line with six rebounds and four assists and scored exactly 27 points for the third straight game. ROOKIE WATCH:  San Antonio's  Kawhi Leonard  contributed five points, five rebounds, two assists and two steals. He was 1-for-4 from 3-point range. NOTABLE:  Marion (sore left knee), the only Maverick who had started every game this season, is day-to-day and Haywood (sprained right knee) is expected to miss at least four more games. ... The Mavericks are 13-1 when they score 100 or more points and 14-2 when they shoot at least 45 percent from the field. ... San Antonio is 1-7 on the road when trailing at halftime. ...  Stephen Jackson , acquired Thursday in a trade with Golden State, scored five points and played 17 minutes in his first game with San Antonio since Game 6 of the 2003 NBA Finals. ... Dallas outrebounded the Spurs 48-35, but was outscored 50-26 in the paint. ... The Mavericks have won five straight at home. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Monday @ Denver, Wednesday vs. L.A. Lakers, Friday @ San Antonio. For the Spurs, Wednesday vs. Minnesota, Friday vs. Dallas, Saturday @ New Orleans.
