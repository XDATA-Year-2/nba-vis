 THE FACT:  In his first 24 games with the Pistons,  Josh Smith  averaged 13.8 points and 14.0 field goal attempts. In the past two nights, he has averaged 30.5 points and 23.0 shots. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Scoring inside and out and dominating his matchup with  Paul George , Smith scored 30 points to lead Detroit (12-14) to a 101-96 victory over Indiana Monday before 15,443 in Bankers Life Fieldhouse, handing the Pacers (20-4) their first loss in 12 home games this season while snapping a 10-game losing streak in Indianapolis.  Brandon Jennings  scored 18, including eight of Detroit's final 10 points in the final 3:47.  Lance Stephenson  led Indiana with a career-high 23 points, while  Luis Scola  had a season-high 18 off the bench. George scored 17 but shot 4-for-14. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "I just looked at his numbers here, his numbers in Atlanta and tried to figure out what I can do to get him better shots, get him playing well."  --  Detroit coach  Maurice Cheeks  on his recent meeting with Smith 
 
 
 THE STAT:   Detroit outrebounded Indiana 55-40 and had advantages of 22-14 on second-chance points and 44-38 in the paint. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Though Detroit led 56-49 at the half, this was nothing new for the Pacers, who've trailed 13 times at intermission but have dominated second halves, outscoring opponents by 222 points in their first 23 games. But with Smith hitting four quick shots, the Pistons started the third quarter quickly, pushing the lead to 72-61 and putting the Pacers on their heels. Indiana threatened midway through the fourth quarter when Scola scored six in an 8-0 run that cut the deficit to 89-87 at 4:54 but Smith flushed a lob and Jennings hit a 3-pointer and a pair of free throws to make it a 96-89 game. Stephenson wasn't quite done, hitting a pair of free throws and a 3-pointer to make it 96-94 but that was as close as the Pacers would come. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "The last five minutes of the game, coach wants the ball in my hands, not necessarily to shoot it but to make plays for my teammates and just be aggressive. I love it. He's putting a lot of pressure on me because the last five minutes is basically the game." --  Jennings 
 
 
 HOT:  Smith has shot 26-for-46 (.565) in the last two games. ... Stephenson has the first back-to-back 20-point games of his career, totaling 43 on 18-for-28 shooting (.643). ... Scola shot 8-for-11 in 19:32 off the bench. 
 
 NOT:  Pistons guards Jennings and  Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  combined for 7-for-24 shooting. ...  Roy Hibbert  was 2-for-12 and George 4-for-14. ... In the last three games, George has averaged 14.7 points on 10-for-37 shooting (.270). 
 
 QUOTABLE III : "We didn't compete tonight. We didn't come ready to play. They were more aggressive and took advantage of our errors. They were a much better basketball team than us tonight. They played together and got the results. Josh Smith did a great job out there."  --  Pacers forward   David West 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Smith was the fourth player to reach 30 against the Pacers this season, following  Rudy Gay  (30),  Carmelo Anthony  (30) and  Kevin Durant  (36). ... On the second of a back-to-back, Pistons veteran guard  Chauncey Billups  was given the night off to rest.  Will Bynum  picked up his minutes. ... The Pacers revealed Friday as the target date for  Danny Granger's  return. He's missed all but five games since the 2011-12 season due to knee injury and, more recently, a calf strain. ... Indiana is 2-3 when trailing after three periods. ... The Pacers were the first team in NBA history to take a division lead of at least 10 games within the season's first 25, but the Pistons pulled nine back with the victory. ...

After Indiana tied the game 49-all late in the first half, the Pistons scored the final seven points in 63 seconds. ...  Andre Drummond  played just three minutes in the first half due to foul trouble but wound up with nine points and nine boards in 20:42. ...
