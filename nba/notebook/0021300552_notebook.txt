 THE FACT:  The Kings are riding a three-game winning streak for the first time since they beat the Trail Blazers 99-80 on Dec. 8, 2012.   
 
 THE LEAD:   Isaiah Thomas  scored a game-high 26 points with six assists and the Sacramento Kings (13-22) prepared for a six-game road trip with a 124-80 rout of the Cleveland Cavaliers (12-22) Sunday night at Sleep Train Arena. 
 
 Rudy Gay  scored 20 points, grabbed five rebounds and blocked three shots in 29 minutes.  DeMarcus Cousins  notched his 23rd double-double of the season, dropping in 16 points with 11 rebounds, while  Jimmer Fredette  and  Derrick Williams  scored 13 points each off the Kings' bench. 
 
 C.J. Miles  scored 14 points for the Cavs on 5-for-8 shooting.  Newly acquired  Luol Deng  added 12 points and five rebounds, but Cleveland shot just 38.8 percent from the field and was outscored by 44. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I really feel like that meeting helped us out a lot.  I feel like some guys were holding a lot of stuff in.  We were able to get it off our chests and we've been playing some good basketball since." 
  --  DeMarcus Cousins  on the Kings' players-only meeting leading up to their three-game win streak 
 
 
 THE STAT : Sacramento outscored Cleveland 65-30 in the second half and held the Cavs to just 28.2 percent shooting after the intermission. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  At the 6:40 mark of the third quarter, Gay gave the Kings a 76-58 lead with a fast-break lay-in and foul. Sacramento put the pedal down and ran the Cavs off the court after that bucket.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I realize that the defense is not going to happen overnight.  And when you make trades and you bring all of these new guys in, you have to constantly hit the reset button.  But they bought in the last three games.  We've defended at a high level and we protected our home court three times in a row, so that's great." 
 -- Kings coach  Michael Malone 
 
 
 HOT:  Gay was unstoppable for Sacramento, scoring 20 points on 8-for-12 shooting.  
 
 NOT:   Kyrie Irving  struggled all game long, scoring just seven points on 3-for-14 shooting for the Cavs. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Malone could do no wrong -- every player he put in the game performed.  
 
 NOTABLE:  Sacramento's 44-point win marks its largest of the season. Fredette missed his first free throw of the season after hitting his first 12.  Jason Thompson  set a new season high in rebounds with 16.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Cavs, Tuesday @ Los Angeles Lakers, Wednesday @ Portland, Friday @ Denver.  For the Kings, Tuesday @ Indiana, Wednesday @ Minnesota, Friday @ Memphis.
