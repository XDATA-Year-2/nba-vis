  Kings-Bulls notebook   By Kent McDill, for NBA.com Posted Monday March 21, 2011 11:20PM THE FACTS : The Bulls earned their 50th victory of the season with a 132-92 total-team effort against the visiting Sacramento Kings at the United Center on Monday night. The Bulls had eight players in double figures, including  Kyle Korver  (18 points),  Omer Asik  (14 points) and  C.J. Watson  (11 points) off the bench. Each of the starters had at least 14 points.  Marcus Thornton  led the Kings with 25 points. THE FACTS II:  The Bulls have won 12 straight home games, and reached 50 wins for the first time since the dynasty team of 1997-98. QUOTABLE:  "Coach tell us not to fall in love with the 3s, but if we have a wide open shot, we have to take it."    - Bulls guard  Derrick Rose  after the Bulls made 12 of 17 3-pointers Monday. THE STAT:  The Bulls shot 61.3 percent from the floor (49 for 80) and shot even better from 3-point range, 70.6 percent (12 for 17). THE STAT II:  The Kings, one of the worst teams in the league in terms of turnovers, had 10 miscues after just 16 minutes of playing time, and seven of those were on steals by the Bulls. The Kings finished with 22 turnovers and the Bulls had a season-high 16 steals. TURNING POINT:  Perhaps the turning point was Dec. 22, 2009, the last time Sacramento came to the United Center. The Kings rebounded from a 35-point second half deficit to win the game 102-98, and Bulls guard  Derrick Rose  said he wanted payback for that embarrassing defeat. INJURY UPDATE:   Carlos Boozer  returned from the sprained ankle that kept him out of the last five games and scored 16 points with five rebounds.  Luol Deng , who sat out shootaround because of pain from his week-long thigh bruise, had 17 points and  Taj Gibson  had six rebounds despite a severe turf toe suffered in the last game against Indiana. HOT:  Korver was seven for 11 overall and four for five from 3-point range for his game-high 18 points. NOT:  The Kings bench provided 22 points on four-for-22 shooting. ROOKIE WATCH:   Omer Asik  was six for six from the field, all on dunks, and had a pair of blocked shots in 20 minutes of action. QUOTABLE II:  "I know you guys are all concerned about the minutes, so getting the minutes down was good.''   -- Bulls coach  Tom Thibodeau , kidding reporters who have hounded him about the big minutes played by Deng and  Rose. Deng played 33 minutes Monday and Rose had just 28 minutes played. GOOD MOVE:  With eight minutes left in the fourth quarter, Thibodeau removed all of his starters, allowing the bench players to protect the Bulls' 30-point lead. With a significant game at Atlanta on Tuesday, the move allowed the Bulls' starters to get more rest than they are accustomed to. NOTABLE:  After visiting Atlanta and hosting Memphis on Friday, the Bulls play five consecutive games against teams with losing records. UP NEXT:  For the Bulls, @ Atlanta on Tuesday, vs. Memphis on Friday, @ Milwaukee on Saturday. For the Kings, @Milwaukee on Wednesday, at Indiana on Friday, at Philadelphia on Sunday.
