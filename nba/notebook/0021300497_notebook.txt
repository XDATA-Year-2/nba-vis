 THE FACT:  The Charlotte Bobcats snapped their five game losing streak tonight in Sacramento, finishing their season-long five game road trip at 1-4. 
 
 THE LEAD:  For the second straight game, the Sacramento Kings (10-22) laid an egg on their home floor to an Eastern Conference opponent. Tonight is was the Charlotte Bobcats (15-20), who ran through the Kings porous defense on their way to a 113-103 victory.   
 Sacramento had no answer for third-year guard  Kemba Walker .  The Bobcats starting point guard scored 30 points and handed out six assists in the win.   Al Jefferson  kicked in 27 points, including 10 straight during a crucial part of the fourth quarter.  Gerald Henderson  added 16 points and  Ramon Sessions  added 12 off the Charlotte bench.  
 The Kings were paced by  DeMarcus Cousins  and his 26 points and 11 rebounds.  Isaiah Thomas  added 21 points and eight assists for Sacramento, who have now dropped two in a row at home.  Rudy Gay  scored 17 points and grabbed 10 rebounds, while  Jason Thompson  finished with a 15-point, 14-rebound double-double. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "It was time for me to get right.  Like I said, I had a bad third quarter.  I was rushing my shot.  I was just sitting on the bench and I was thinking when I get back in - just seal the game and I got hot and made some good plays."  --  Jefferson on his big fourth quarter 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Kings allowed Charlotte to shoot 64.3 percent from the field and 71.4 percent from the 3-point line in the deciding first half. 
 
 TURNING POINT : Charlotte used a 15-0 run in the late second quarter to take a 65-52 lead into the intermission.  The Kings brought it close a couple of times, but the damage was done early in this one. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "It was a big win, especially for our confidence."  --  Walker on the win 
 
 
 QUOTABLE III : "We think that we can overlook certain teams.  When you're 10-22, you can't overlook anybody."  --  Kings coach  Michael Malone  on his team's performance  
 
 
 HOT:  Walker was unstoppable tonight in Sacramento, scoring 30 points on 12-for-19 shooting. 
 
 HOT II:  Cousins dominated the third quarter, scoring 16 points on 6-for-10 shooting. 
 
 NOT: Jimmer Fredette  scored two points in 13 minutes on 1-for-7 shooting.  
 
 GOOD MOVE: Steve Clifford  and his Bobcats team put their fate in the hands of Jefferson down the stretch and the veteran answered the call.  
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Kings decided not to play defense tonight and the Bobcats made them pay.  
 
 NOTABLE: Josh McRoberts  grabbed a season-high 11 rebounds.  Charlotte shot a season-best 54.2 percent from the field. ... Three Sacramento Kings notched double-doubles in the night, including Cousins (20th of season), Thompson and Gay. (his first with the Kings). Thompson set a new season-high in points with 15...Charlotte is 4-0 when Walker scores at least 30....The Bobcats shot a season-high 54.2 percent...Sacramento is now 6-13 at Sleep Train Arena. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Bobcats, Tuesday vs. Washington, Friday @ Minnesota, Saturday @ Denver. For the Kings, Tuesday vs. Portland, Friday vs. Orlando, Sunday vs. Cleveland.
