 THE FACT:  Portland's 16-point win marked its largest margin of victory in Dallas since registering a 28-point win over the Mavericks on March 10, 1993. 
 
 THE LEAD:  LaMarcus Aldridge  scored 30 points to lead five Trail Blazers in double figures, pacing Portland to a 127-111 rout of the Mavericks Saturday night at the American Airlines Center. 
 Led by  Nicolas Batum 's 15 first-quarter points, Portland (31-9) jumped out to a 12-point advantage and never looked back, pushing its lead to as much as 38 in the fourth quarter.  Dirk Nowitzki  led the way for Dallas with 18 points. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I was really proud of the way our team played tonight, especially on the heels of an emotional win in San Antonio last night. Our resolve, defensively, I thought was very good and got us into a position to have a large lead." 
 -- Blazers coach  Terry Stotts 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Portland dominated near the rim, outscoring Dallas 60-38 in the paint and outrebounding the Mavericks 55-30. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Trailing early, Dallas closed the Blazers lead to single digits midway through the second quarter. Portland answered right back, rattling off a 19-9 run to close the frame, pushing its lead to 71-52.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "The first three quarters were beyond embarrassing ... Other than saying, 'beyond embarrassing,' I don't know what to say. The guys that were in there in the fourth quarter really fought. They won the quarter 41-23, which is great. I'm going to find guys that will fight and get them in the game, simple as that." 
 -- Mavericks coach  Rick Carlisle
