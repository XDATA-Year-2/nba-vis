  Notebook: Magic 103, Sixers 87 Posted Wednesday February 15, 2012 11:01PM By Dick Scanlon, for NBA.com THE FACTS: Ryan Anderson  scored 27 points and  Jameer Nelson  matched his career high with 14 assists, leading the Orlando Magic to a 103-87 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers. Lou Williams  led Philadelphia with 21 points, but the Sixers never led in the game. The Magic had six scorers in double figures for the second straight game. QUOTABLE:  "When everybody's active and everybody's involved, that's when we play our best."   -- Magic forward Ryan Anderson THE STAT:  The Magic made 15-of-25 3-point shots and are shooting 46 percent from behind the arc in their last five games. TURNING POINT:  The Sixers made a couple of runs, but the game never really turned around after they fell behind, 23-6. QUOTABLE II:  "The start of the game killed us. We were passive offensively and then we missed a lot of easy shots. I thought that played with our psyche a little bit and discouraged us. And then (Ryan) Anderson) hit us with that red-hot start."   -- Sixers coach  Doug Collins . HOT:  Anderson hit his first four 3-point shots in the first quarter and made 7-of-10 for the game. NOT:  The Sixers could not make up for missing 14 of their first 21 shots and falling behind by 17 points. GOOD MOVE:  Magic coach  Stan Van   Gundy  took the occasion to remind Anderson (two rebounds) that there is more to the game than scoring. QUOTABLE III:  "He shot the ball great and that's fabulous, and now he needs to get back on the boards."   -- Van Gundy BAD MOVE:  Williams had shot the 76ers back into the game with 11 points when Collins gave him a rest with 2:08 left in the first half. The Magic promptly ran off the last 10 points of the half to lead by 16. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Although he has not started a game and averaged only 26 minutes, Williams is the Sixers' leading scorer at 16.1 points per game. ROOKIE WATCH: Lavoy Allen  started at center for the Sixers, but had two points and no rebounds in 13 minutes. NOTABLE:  The Sixers are 0-6 when giving up 100 points or more, 20-4 when they don't . . . Magic center  Dwight Howard , who was shooting 10.8 free throws per game though his first 27 games, has attempted only seven in his last three games . . . The Magic have won 12 of their last 14 against Philly, including a 74-69 loss at Philadelphia on Jan. 30 . . . Anderson had no problem with Van Gundy making an issue of his rebounding. "I always want someone to try to bring the best out of me and I know that's what he was doing. I had two rebounds tonight; I know I can do a lot better than that," Anderson said. UP NEXT:  For the 76ers, Friday vs. Dallas, Sunday @ Minnesota, Tuesday @ Memphis. For the Magic, Friday vs. Milwaukee, Sunday @ Miami, Monday @ Milwaukee.
