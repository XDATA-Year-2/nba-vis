  Notebook: Thunder 95, Mavs 86   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday February 1, 2012 11:41PM THE FACTS:   Russell Westbrook  scored 33 points and  Kevin Durant  and  Serge Ibaka  both had double-doubles for the Oklahoma City Thunder in Wednesday's 95-86 win against the Dallas Mavericks at the American Airlines Center. Durant tallied 23 points and 13 rebounds and Ibaka registered a career-high 10 blocks and 11 boards.  Jason Terry  scored 25 for the Mavericks, who played without injured starters  Jason Kidd  and  Brendan Haywood  and reserve  Lamar Odom . THE STAT:  Mavericks forward  Dirk Nowitzki  was held to eight points on 2-for-15 shooting (0-for-5 from 3-point range). It was just the third time in his 14-year career that he played at least 37 minutes (37:40) and sank two or fewer field goals: Nov. 27, 2006 vs. Minnesota (2-for-8) and Dec. 5, 1999 at Milwaukee (2-for-9). In the first two meetings this season against Oklahoma City, he averaged 27.5 points and was a combined 19-for-33. QUOTABLE I:  "We finally found out that he is human."   -- Thunder coach  Scott Brooks  on Nowitzki's struggles. TURNING POINT:  Dallas erased a 10-point deficit in the fourth, knotting the score at 85-85 on a hook by  Shawn Marion  with 2:14 to play. Westbrook answered with a 19-footer and then Ibaka rejected his 10th shot of the night on a layup attempt by  Rodrigue Beaubois . The Thunder outscored the Mavericks 10-1 in the final 1:59, including Westbrook's long 3-pointer with 35.9 seconds left. HOT:  Dallas led 29-21 after shooting 68 percent (13-for-19) from the field during the first quarter. NOT:  The Mavericks missed 12 of their first 13 shots in the third quarter and shot a dreadful 21 percent (8-for-38) in the second half. They missed all seven 3-point attempts after intermission. GOOD MOVE:  Thunder guard  Thabo Sefolosha  missed his second straight game with soreness in his right foot. On Monday,  James Harden  started for Sefolosha and struggled in the loss to the Clippers. At Dallas,  Daequan Cook  got his first-ever start for Oklahoma City and Harden moved back to his usual sixth-man role, delivering 10 points, a game-high nine assists and seven rebounds with only one turnover in 36 minutes. BAD MOVE:  Mavericks head coach  Rick Carlisle  looked like was auditioning for a kicking job with the Dallas Cowboys when he booted the ball into the seats with 9:34 left in the fourth quarter. He picked up his second technical foul of the period and was ejected. QUOTABLE II:  "I want to apologize to our franchise,  Mark  [ Cuban ], our fans. The incident where the ball got kicked into the stands -- that can't happen. My intent was not to kick it into the stands. I was trying to kick it to the referee, but I'm not a very good kicker."   -- Rick Carlisle on his ejection. ROOKIE WATCH:   Reggie Jackson  finished with seven points and two rebounds in 11 minutes for the Thunder. NOTABLE:  The Mavericks played without Haywood (lower back stiffness), Odom (stomach ailment) and Kidd (strained right calf). ... Replacing Haywood,  Ian Mahinmi  made his first career start and tallied six points and nine rebounds. Marion had a double-double for Dallas with 12 points and 10 boards and  Brandan Wright  added 12 points and three blocks. ... Oklahoma City only used eight players. ... Westbrook added six rebounds, four assists, two steals and a block. ... Dallas had a three-game winning streak snapped. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Friday vs. Indiana, Saturday @ Cleveland, Wednesday @ Denver. For the Thunder, Friday vs. Memphis, Saturday @ San Antonio, Monday @ Portland.
