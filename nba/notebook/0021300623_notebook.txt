 THE FACT: Paul Millsap  scored nine of his 24 points down the stretch to help the Atlanta Hawks avoid losing to the Orlando Magic for the third time. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Millsap added six rebounds, five assists, five blocks and three steals, and  Jeff Teague  had 23 points for the Hawks, who squandered a 19-point lead and found themselves down by six midway through the fourth quarter. 
 The Hawks (22-19) sealed their first road victory of 2014 by making nine straight free throws over the final 2:13 for the 112-109 win. 
 
 Victor Oladipo  finished with 24 points, seven rebounds and seven assists for the Magic (11-32), who have lost 11 of 12. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I wish they could put a leadership column on the stat sheet. Tonight when we got down, Paul was the one that pulled them together. All the other stuff is great. We appreciate the rebounds and the blocks, but I think it's his leadership, and I think our group needs that going forward." 
 -- Hawks coach  Mike Budenholzer 
 
 
 THE STAT:  After scoring 26 points in the paint in each of their first three games against Orlando, the Hawks had 36 in the first half Wednesday night and finished with 50. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Magic had their biggest lead of the game, 98-92, when  Pero Antic  nailed a 3-pointer for the Hawks with 6:08 left. 
 
 HOT:  Magic guard  Doron Lamb  was 5-for-6 (3-for-4 from behind the arc) and scored a season-high 13 points before fouling out in less than 19 minutes. 
 
 NOT:  Antic was just 2-for-9 shooting, and in the middle of the third quarter he had no points and 10 rebounds. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Leading by three in the closing seconds, the Hawks put the 6-foot-7  Kyle Korver  on  Jameer Nelson , who predictably forced an unsuccessful 3-point shot at the buzzer. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "When I looked up, when I actually got a grip on the ball, I saw five (seconds) on the clock, and after that you have to make an executive decision. You have to figure it out. You are a basketball player." 
 -- Jameer   Nelson 
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  In the absence of the injured  Al Horford , Millsap has emerged as Atlanta's go-to scorer and all-around leader.  
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "He does that every night, Do-It-All-Paul. He can score the basketball, rebound, pass it, everything. He's been the ultimate player for us this year, and he did it again tonight." 
 -- Jeff Teague 
 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Despite sitting with two fouls after less than 2 1/2 minutes, Oladipo had one of his best games. ... Antic (10 points, 12 rebounds) was also a major factor down the stretch. 
 
 NOTABLE:  It took only 4:35 for Korver to stretch his NBA record of games with at least one 3-pointer to 110. ... Both teams shot 41-for-83 (49.4 percent). ... Lamb's final three fouls came in a span of nine seconds. ... The Magic are 1-24 when they give up 100 points or more. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Hawks: Friday vs. San Antonio, Saturday @ Milwaukee, Monday @ Oklahoma City. For the Magic: Friday vs. L.A. Lakers, Sunday @ New Orleans, Tuesday @ Detroit.
