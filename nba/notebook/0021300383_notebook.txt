 THE FACT:  Each of the Sixers' past four victories have come at home in overtime. They played a total of three overtime games last season. 
 
 THE LEAD:   Evan Turner  drove to the basket and scored at the buzzer, lifting the Philadelphia 76ers past the Brooklyn Nets 121-120 in overtime Friday night at the Wells Fargo Center. Turner scored a game-high 29 points and added 10 rebounds while  Thaddeus Young  scored 25 points.  Tony Wroten  contributed 19 points off the bench and point guard  Michael Carter-Williams  added 15 points and 10 assists in his return after missing the previous seven games with a skin infection on his right knee.  Spencer Hawes  and  Lavoy Allen  had 10 points apiece for the Sixers, who improved to 8-19 and halted a seven-game losing streak. 
 
 Alan Anderson  paced the Nets with a season-high 26 points while  Paul Pierce  scored 24 points and swept 10 rebounds.  Brook Lopez  added 22 points while  Mirza Teletovic  had 18 and  Deron Williams  had 17 points and 14 assists. The Nets fell to 9-17. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I was thinking, 'Where did the ball go?' I thought it came out the other side." 
 -- Turner, on his game-winning shot which bounced on the rim three times before falling through. 
 
 
 THE STAT:   The Sixers outscored Brooklyn 66-30 in points in the paint. Over the past three games, the Sixers are outscoring opponents by an average of 22.7 points in the paint. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The game featured 31 lead changes and 21 ties. Both teams made a number of big shots, especially in overtime. 
 
 HOT:  Turner was 13-for-22 while Young was 11-for-18. Teletovic knocked down six of his 11 shots from beyond the arc and Pierce was 7-for-9 from the field. 
 
 NOT:  Andray Blatche  missed seven of his 10 shots while Hawes was 3-for-14 for the Sixers. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:   The Sixers kept attacking the basket, even when they weren't getting calls from the officials. In the end, the aggressive play paid off with Turner's difficult shot to win the game. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Nets could have gone to Pierce more. He took nine shots and missed only two. Pierce actually put the Nets ahead 120-119 following a 3-pointer with 16.9 seconds remaining in overtime. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The crowd of 15,267 was buzzing all night. It was a great atmosphere and the fans erupted when Turner's shot won the game at the buzzer. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We needed to get that win for the sanity of the group." 
 -- Sixers coach  Brett Brown 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Neither forward  Kevin Garnett  nor guard  Joe Johnson  played for the Nets. Garnett was given the night off to rest and Johnson was held out for personal reasons. ... Young denied a published report that indicated he asked the Sixers for a trade. "At the end of the day, like I said, I'm here, ready to go, 110 percent, ready to give it my all each and every night," Young said. "That's my makeup. My makeup is to go out there and continue to be a professional basketball player and continue to work hard for this city. ... When I saw the story yesterday, I looked at it, I laughed and then I went back to playing with my two sons. That tells you how much I cared about it." ... Turner earned his sixth double-double of the season. ... The Sixers are 7-9 when  Carter-Williams  plays and 1-10 without him. ... The Sixers topped the 120-point mark for the fourth time this season. ...  Shaun Livingston  had 11 assists off the bench for the Nets. ... Hawes nearly registered a triple-double despite an off shooting night with 10 points, nine rebounds and eight assists. ... The Nets were 15-for-33 from 3-point territory. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "I don't know. We need to turn it around. We've been talking about it for a while. We just need to go out and do it." 
 --  Deron Williams , on reasons for the team's struggling defense .
