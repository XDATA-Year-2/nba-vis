 THE FACTS:  After going 6-1 on the road, the Golden State Warriors returned home Tuesday night and stayed hot, beating the New Orleans Hornets 103-96 at Oracle Arena. 
 Warriors forward  David Lee , the reigning Western Conference Player of the Week, scored 26 points and grabbed nine rebounds.  Klay Thompson  added 19 points, while former Hornets  Jarrett Jack  and  Carl Landry  came off the bench to score 16 apiece for the Warriors (17-8). Jack added 10 assists for his first double-double of the season, while Landry had nine rebounds. 
 Forward  Ryan Anderson  had 28 points off the bench for the Hornets (5-19), who lost their eighth straight game. Rookie forward  Anthony Davis , who  returned to the starting lineup, had his third career double-double with 15 points and a career-high 16 rebounds. Guard  Greivis Vasquez  had 20 points. 
 The Warriors took a 90-78 lead with just over seven minutes left on Landry's 15-foot jump shot, but New Orleans went on a 14-2 and tied the game 92-92 when Davis scored inside, drew a foul and completed a three-point play with 4:07 left. 
 Golden State, however, regained the lead for good on a pair of Jack free throws at the 3:25 mark, making it 94-92. After Vasquez was called for traveling,  Stephen Curry  hit a jump shot then Jack made two more free throws, putting the Warriors ahead 98-92 with 1:24 left. New Orleans never got closer than four points again. 
 The Warriors had built a 59-50 halftime lead as Lee poured in 19 points and grabbed seven rebounds, while Thompson scored 14 and Jack 10. Anderson countered with 14 first-half points for New Orleans. 
 The Warriors extended their lead to 82-72 after three quarters with Thompson scoring five more points and Lee four. By that point in the game, Davis already had a double-double with 12 points and 14 rebounds. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We had a lot of confidence tonight, a lot more confidence than in the past. It's no fun when a team's catching up on you like that, but I think we had confidence we could make plays down the stretch. And we found a way to do that by getting stops."  
 -- David Lee 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Jack and Landry combined for 32 points, 11 assists and 12 rebounds. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Hornets trailed just 94-92 and appeared ready to tie the game, but Vasquez was called for traveling before he was able to dish to a wide-open teammate with 2:32 left. Curry quickly popped a jumper. Then after Anderson and ex-Warrior  Dominic McGuire  missed, Curry rebounded for the Warriors. Thompson missed from outside, but rookie  Draymond Green  rebounded. Jack then drew a foul from  Austin Rivers  and sank both free throws with 1:24 left. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It's just a tough loss for us, especially when you tie it up, you have a chance to win. All you need is a couple stops and a couple of buckets. We just haven't found that closing mentality, a couple guys who can knock down a shot or even get to the free throw line."  
 -- Hornets coach  Monty Williams 
 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Rivers had 12 points  on 6-for-11 shooting, but he was 0-for-3 from long range. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Hornets coach Monty Williams shook up his starting lineup, inserting Davis and forward  Lance Thomas  for Anderson and  Al-Farouq Aminu . Davis, the no. 1 overall pick in the 2012 Draft, came off the bench the previous four games after missing 11 straight games with an ankle injury. He made his seventh career start. Anderson scored 28 points, well above his average of 18.6 coming into the game. Davis had a double-double with 16 rebounds and 15 points, to go with four steals and a block. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Lee's career-high streak of games with at least 20 points and 10 rebounds came to an end at seven -- he was one rebound short -- but he remained red hot. He scored 26 and cracked the 20-point mark for a career-high ninth straight game,  
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  It was  Andrew Bogut  Bobblehead night at Oracle Arena, but the 7-foot center was on the bench in street clothes again as he continues to rehab his surgically repaired left ankle. Bogut has appeared in only four games and hasn't played since Nov. 7 against Cleveland. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Anderson scored 28 points but didn't have a single rebound or assist. ... The Warriors are now 12-4 when Landry scores in double-digits. ... The Warriors are off to a 17-8 start for the first time since the 1991-92 season. .... Golden State improved to 7-3 at Oracle. ... Warriors rookie center  Festus Ezeli  returned to the starting lineup after missing one game with a bruised right knee. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Hornets, Wednesday at L.A. Clippers, Friday at San Antonio, Saturday vs. Indiana. For the Warriors, Wednesday @ Sacramento, Friday vs. Charlotte, Saturday vs. L.A. Lakers.
