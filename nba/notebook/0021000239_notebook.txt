  Heat-Mavericks notebook   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Sunday November 28, 2010 12:12AM THE FACTS:  The new Miami Heat suffered the same fate as the old Miami Heat, going down in flames with yet another loss to the Dallas Mavericks. The Mavericks' 106-95 win Saturday was their 13th straight regular-season victory against Miami.  Caron Butler  (23 points) and  Dirk Nowitzki  (22) paced six Mavericks in double figures as streaking Dallas collected its season-high fifth straight win. QUOTABLE:  "Just not second-guessing myself and just going out there and taking what was given to me. My teammates put me in a great situation to be successful and I was nailing shots."   -- Caron Butler, who was 3-for-3 from 3-point range, on what was working for him against Miami. THE STAT:  This was the 108th time in franchise history that the Mavericks have played four games in a five-night span and just the third time they have completed the four-game sweep.

TURNING POINT:  After a back-and-forth first half that included eight ties, 14 lead changes and no lead greater than six points for either side, the Mavericks dominated the third quarter. Butler scored 12 in the period as Dallas outscored Miami 31-17 and led by as many as 18 points. The Mavs did not turn the ball over and registered assists on nine of their 11 field goals in the quarter.

The Heat shot 16.7 percent (3-for-18) in the period. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  With 23 points,  LeBron James  extended his streak to 14 consecutive games with at least 20.

Dwyane Wade  tallied 22 points and nine rebounds, but turned it over seven times. ...  Jason Kidd  dished out a game-high 13 assists and  Shawn Marion  scored 14 points (all in the first half) for the Mavericks. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Despite the team's struggles this season, Dallas Cowboys wide receiver  Miles Austin  received a hearty ovation from the crowd at American Airlines Center. NOTABLE:  The Heat lost for the fourth time in five games. ... Miami is 0-7 when trailing at halftime. ... Dallas is 8-0 when five or more players score in double figures and 6-0 when scoring 100 or more points. ... Former Mavs center  Erick Dampier  made his Heat debut and contributed one rebound and one foul in eight minutes. ... The Dallas bench outscored Miami's reserves 39-22 and the Mavericks outscored the Heat 48-26 in the paint. UP NEXT:  For the Heat, Monday vs. Washington, Wednesday vs. Detroit, Thursday @ Cleveland.
