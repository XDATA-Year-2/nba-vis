 THE FACTS:   Kevin Durant  poured in a career-high 52 points, including nine of Oklahoma City's 12 points in overtime to lead the Thunder to a thrilling 117-114 victory Friday against the Dallas Mavericks at the American Airlines Center. The Thunder (32-8) won their sixth straight and snapped a four-game winning streak by a gutsy Dallas (17-24) squad that overcame a 14-point second-half deficit and forced the extra session with a 3-pointer by  O.J. Mayo  with 2.3 seconds left. 
 
 Russell Westbrook  added 31 points and  Serge Ibaka  had 11 points and 14 rebounds for the Thunder, who hurt the Mavericks all night with offensive rebounds (18). They outscored Dallas 25-11 in second-chance points, including a huge 3-pointer by Durant in overtime. Oklahoma City also took advantage of some untimely Mavs miscues, scoring 24 points off 16 turnovers. 
 
 Vince Carter  led the Mavericks with a season-high 29 points off the bench.  Dirk Nowitzki  and Mayo scored 18 each,  Darren Collison  finished with 15 points and  Elton Brand  posted a double-double with 10 points and 13 boards. Dallas opened the fourth quarter with a 20-8 run to take its first lead since the first quarter, but simply had no answer for Durant. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Sometimes when your shot doesn't fall, you've got to find a way to attack the basket and will yourself to get opportunities. He did that tonight and got opportunities at the free-throw line. He's an amazing player and he deserves everything that he has earned." 
 --Thunder coach  Scott Brooks  on Durant 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Mavericks are 1-8 in overtime, including two losses to the Thunder. The NBA record for most overtime losses in a season is 10, shared by the Baltimore Bullets (1952-53) and the Los Angeles Clippers (2000-01). 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Led by Durant's phenomenal 21-for-21 effort (10-for-10 in the fourth quarter and overtime), the Thunder shot 91.7 percent from the line (33-for-36). The only player in NBA history to make more free throws in a game without a miss was Atlanta's  Dominique Wilkins , who went 23-for-23 against Chicago on Dec. 8, 1992. The Nets'  Deron Williams  also had a 21-for-21 game on March 4, 2012 against Charlotte. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "There are some things that we obviously could have done to limit [Durant]. He had a great game and he is the best shooter on the planet." 
 -- Mavericks coach  Rick Carlisle 
 
 
 HOT:  Nowitzki and Brand accounted for 22 of the Mavs' 33 points and nine of the team's 11 rebounds during the fourth quarter. ... Durant scored 16 in the third quarter. ... Carter finished 10-for-17 from the field and 4-for-8 from 3-point distance in his highest-scoring game as a Maverick. 
 
 NOT:  Through the first three quarters, Nowitzki and Brand had a combined three points on 1-for-17 shooting. Nowitzki missed his first seven shots and Brand missed his first six. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Journeyman point guard  Mike James , who just signed a second 10-day contract, definitely isn't the player Mavericks fans expected to take the biggest shot of the night with 3.9 seconds left and Dallas down by two. Although he had made a 3-pointer earlier in the overtime session, his shot from at least 3 feet behind the arc came with  Kendrick Perkins  in his face and bounced off the rim. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Durant's previous career high was 51 points against Denver on Feb. 19, 2012. It matched the third-highest total ever by a Mavericks opponent, trailing the 62 scored by  Kobe Bryant  on Dec. 20, 2005 and 53 points by  Tim Duncan  on Dec. 26, 2001. Durant added nine rebounds. 
 
 NOTABLE:  This was the opener of a season-long six-game, 10-day road trip for the Thunder. ... It was Oklahoma City's first game at the American Airlines Center since finishing a first-round playoff sweep last season. ... The Thunder scored 30 points in the first quarter, the ninth time they have had 30-plus in the opening period this season. ... Nowitzki became the 23rd player in NBA history with 8,500 made field goals. ... Oklahoma City is 20-4 when Durant and Westbrook both score at least 20. ... OKC is 20-3 against the Western Conference. ... The Thunder improved to 3-2 in their alternate navy blue uniforms. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Sunday @ Orlando, Friday vs. San Antonio, Jan. 27 vs. Phoenix. For the Thunder, Sunday @ Denver, Tuesday @ Los Angeles Clippers, Wednesday @ Golden State.
