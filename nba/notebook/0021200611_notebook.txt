 THE FACTS: Tim Duncan  had 24 points and 17 rebounds while  Tony Parker  scored 20 points and added eight assists in the San Antonio Spurs' 90-85 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers Monday night at the Wells Fargo Center.  Kawhi Leonard  scored 16 points and  Tiago Splitter  had a double-double consisting of 10 points and 12 rebounds for the Spurs, who improved to 33-11. 
 
 Evan Turner  led the Sixers with 18 points and 12 rebounds while  Spencer Hawes  scored 16 points off the bench.  Jrue Holiday  had 15 points,  Thaddeus Young c ontributed 14 and  Nick Young  had 12. The Sixers fell to 17-24 and 11-10 at home. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "Sometimes, basketball is funny. You just have to hang in there and hope the storm will stop. The storm lasted for a long time, but in the fourth quarter, we got it done. " 
 -- Tony Parker on letting a 17-point lead slip away and then rallying back 
 
 THE STAT : The Spurs improved to 14-0 this season when holding opponents below 90 points. Meanwhile, the Sixers are now 3-17 when scoring below 90. 
 
 TURNING POINT : Trailing 82-75 with 5:40 left, the Spurs began executing with precision, as Sixers coach  Doug Collins  discussed before the game. Suddenly, a seven-point deficit turned into an 88-83 lead with 20.2 seconds remaining following two free throws by Parker. While the Spurs were executing, the Sixers were fizzling. Too many turnovers and poor offensive flow hurt them down the stretch. 
 
 HOT : Duncan was 10-for-17 while Parker was 8-for-15. 
 
 NOT : Holiday missed 13 of his 20 shots while Dorell Wright was 1-for-5. For the Spurs,  Stephen Jackson  misfired on all six of his shots. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "It's pretty amazing at his age what he does night after night." 
 -- Spurs coach G regg Popovich  on 36-year-old center Tim Duncan 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT : Duncan had 24 points, 17 rebounds, five assists, two steals and one blocked shot. It was his fifth double-double this season and his second game with at least 24 points, 17 rebounds and five assists. Turner nearly reached a triple-double for the Sixers with 18 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA : The Wells Fargo Center was electric throughout the game. When a video montage was shown featuring Sixers legend  Charles Barkley , the crowd rose and gave him a standing ovation. Barkley was part of the TNT telecast for this game. Former Eagles quarterback Ron Jaworski attended the game and received a nice ovation. 
 
 QUOTABLE III : "They've been together for so long and are so comfortable with each other. They don't ever seem rattled. They kept executing and did what they needed to do down the stretch to win." 
 -- Jrue Holiday 
 
 GOOD MOVE : Even when they let a 17-point lead slip away and fell behind by seven with 5:40 remaining, the Spurs never stopped running their offense or playing team defense. They stuck with the same game plan that originally pushed the lead to 17. In the end, it all paid off with a gritty road victory. 
 
 BAD MOVE : The Sixers' offense stalled when they built that seven-point advantage. They stopped moving the ball and playing aggressive defense. There was way too much one-on-one offense and it led to numerous empty possessions. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH : Spurs guard  Nando De Colo  had two points, four assists and three rebounds in 13:30 off the bench. For the Sixers, forward  Arnett Moultrie  received a DNP-CD. 
 
 NOTABLE : Injured Sixers center  Andrew Bynum  met with reporters one hour before tip-off and said he still hopes to return somewhere around the All-Star break from Feb. 15-17. Bynum has been sidelined all season with bilateral bone bruises on both knees. Bynum said his knees "feel good" and he participated in shootaround Monday morning. ... Sixers guard  Jason Richardson  was out with left knee synovitis. ... The Spurs continued to play without guard  Manu Ginobili , who is recovering from a Grade 1 left hamstring strain. ... Leonard left the game in the fourth quarter with a left knee injury. ... The Sixers committed 16 turnovers and have had at least 13 in eight of the last nine games. ... Over the past 14 games, Parker is averaging 21.5 points on 54.4 percent shooting. The Spurs are 11-3 during that span. ... San Antonio has won five straight against the Sixers. ... The Sixers haven't won consecutive games since a season-high tying three-game win streak from Nov. 25-30. 
 
 NEXT : For the Spurs, Wednesday vs. New Orleans, Friday @ Dallas, Saturday vs. Phoenix. For the Sixers, Tuesday @ Milwaukee, Saturday vs. New York, Monday vs. Memphis.
