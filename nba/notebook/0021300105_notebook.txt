 THE FACT:  Portland won the 3-point game by 24 points. The Blazers were 11-for-23 from beyond the arc, Detroit 3-for-14. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Point guard  Damian Lillard  scored 25 points to lead six players in double figures in Portland's 109-103 victory over Detroit Monday night at the Moda Center. 
 
   Mo Williams  came off the bench for a season-high 17 points for the Blazers (5-2), who won for the third straight game.  LaMarcus Aldridge  collected 18 points and 12 rebounds and  Robin Lopez  had season highs in points (17) and rebounds (12) for the winners. 
 
 Brandon Jennings  scored a season-high 28 points to lead Detroit (2-4).  Andre Drummond  (16 points, 16 rebounds) and  Greg Monroe  (19 points, eight rebounds) also had big games for the Pistons.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I didn't shoot the ball well at Sacramento, but I thought I played a good game other than that, and we won. I didn't think about it too much. I took the same shots I've been taking; they just went in."  --  Lillard, who was 7-for-16 vs. Detroit, including 5-for - 8 from 3-point range. 
 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Portland led 83-80 early in the fourth quarter, then outscored the Pistons 24-14 over the next seven minutes to take a 107-94 advantage. Detroit came back with a 9-0 run, but it wasn't enough. 
 
 HOT : Williams, who entered the game shooting 37 percent from the field, got on a roll early, going 7-for-7 and scoring 15 points in the first half. He finished 7-for-9 for 17 points with four assists and three rebounds in 32 minutes. 
 
 NOT:  Sixth man  Rodney Stuckey  shot often but not accurately for Detroit, burping up 15 attempts from the field and making four in his 34 minutes. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "The difference was the Blazers shot 3s. They have inside and outside presence, but all of their prominent guys shoot 3s, and it happened tonight."  --  Detroit coach  Maurice Cheeks. 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Williams decided to press the issue early, taking the ball to the basket and shooting his jumper early. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Cheeks chose early to bring double-team help on Aldridge, despite having the 6-foot-11 Monroe to defend Portland's All-Star power forward. Aldridge twice passed out of the double-team to an open teammate for a basket. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "His mom is here. She's staying the rest of the season now, man."  --  Aldridge on Lopez. 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Aldridge failed to reach the 20-point mark for the first time this season. His six-game streak was the Blazers' longest to open the season since  Clyde Drexler  scored 20 the first 12 games in 1988-89. ... Aldridge became the sixth player in Portland history with 4,000 career rebounds. ... The Blazers' streak of seven straight games with eight or more 3-pointers is the club's longest such streak since the advent of the 3-point line in 1979-80. ... For the first time this season, the Pistons had the services of 6-foot-11  Charlie Villaneuva , who missed the first five games with a shoulder injury. He finished with two points on 1-for-3 shooting in five minutes. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Pistons, Tuesday @ Golden State, Friday @ Sacramento, Sunday @ L.A. Lakers. For the Trail Blazers, Wednesday vs. Phoenix, Friday @ Boston, Sunday @ Toronto.
