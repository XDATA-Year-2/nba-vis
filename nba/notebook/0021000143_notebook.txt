 The Lakers (8-2) have now dropped back-to-back games and suffered their first home loss of the season. In the loss,  Kobe Bryant  filled the stat sheet: 25 points, 14 assists, nine rebounds and eight turnovers.  Pau Gasol  tallied 28 points and 17 rebounds and  Lamar Odom  added 22 and 17. QUOTABLE:  "I didn't know what the record was. I know we made a lot of them. I didn't know we were close to the record or anything like that."  --  Richardson on the team nearly matching the NBA record for most threes made in a game THE STAT:  22 -- The number of 3-pointers made by the Suns, which was a franchise record (the previous was 20 made). The NBA record is 23 triples (Orlando accomplished that feat    against Sacramento on Jan 13, 2009 ). This isn't the first time the Suns have hurt the Lakers from deep. The Lakers previous franchise-high for most threes allowed was to Phoenix, which made 19 on April 11, 2005. The Suns came into the game averaging approximately nine threes per game, but against the Lakers, they were 22-for-40 from deep. TURNING POINT:  The Lakers took their largest lead of the game, 46-40, but then the Suns' outside shooting caught fire. The Suns went on a 16-2 run, which included knocking down four triples in less than two minutes, to go up 56-48. Phoenix did not trail from that point on. QUOTABLE II:  "That's remarkable. That's remarkable, the shooting."  --  Lakers coach  Phil Jackson  on the Suns' 3-point barrage HOT:  Richardson scored 16 of his 35 points in the third quarter when he connected on 6-for-8 from the field, including 3-for-4 from deep. For the game, Richardson was 7-for-10 from behind the arc. "The basket was huge," Richardson said. "It was double (the size), and every shot I threw up felt like it was going to go in." NOT:  A technical foul was called on Odom after he showed emotion following a made basket, which he thought he was fouled on. Nash drained the technical shot to give the Suns a 112-109 lead with 53.7 left in the game. "I was unhappy about the situation that happened with Lamar,"    Jackson said.  "I don't think the NBA wants those type of things to happen ... it changes the context of the ball game. (The NBA rules) say we expect normal reaction, but we don't want continuing banter. So that wasn't continuing and that was a normal reaction so that's why I'm saying we expect better judgment in that situation." Added Suns coach Alvin Gentry: "If you ask me if I liked the call, I don't particularly like the call, but the rule is what it is." FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Nash recorded his fourth straight double-double (21 points, 13 assists). He also had zero turnovers. Nash has now dished out 53 assists in his last four games. NOTABLE:  Odom will undergo an MRI on his right foot Monday. "I'm not sure," said Odom on how he injured his foot. "It's been aching, especially in the morning. But I've been playing a lot of basketball. Hopefully, it's just wear and tear."... Lakers center  Theo Ratliff  will have an MRI on his left knee ... Phoenix center  Robin Lopez  suffered a sprained left knee when teammate  Jared Dudley  crashed into him at the 6:04 mark of the second quarter. Lopez, who did not return, was favoring his leg as he walked to the bench, and shortly after he went to the locker room. He will have an MRI on Monday. Lopez played just six minutes after picking up his second foul in the first 4:18 of the game ... Phoenix shot 51.2 percent for the game and made 65 percent of its shots in the third quarter. UP NEXT:  For the Lakers, Tuesday @ Milwaukee, Wednesday @ Detroit, Friday @ Minnesota. For the Suns, Monday vs. Denver, Wednesday @ Miami, Thursday @ Orlando.
