 THE FACT:  Milwaukee shot less than 35 percent and scored fewer than 80 points for the second consecutive night. 
 
 THE LEAD: Russell Westbrook  scored 26 points and  Kevin Durant  added 24 as the Oklahoma City Thunder snapped a two-game skid with a 92-79 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks Saturday night at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. 
 The Thunder (6-3) struggled to 31.3 percent shooting in the first half, but scored 32 third-quarter points to break away from a 40-40 tie at the half. 
 
 O.J. Mayo  led the Bucks (2-7) with 22 points, but the Bucks shot just 34.9 percent (30-for-86) and suffered their fifth straight loss. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I just told them that they had to keep grinding every possession. Offensively in the first half we couldn't make any shots, but we still stayed with it defensively. I told them our shots were going to start to fall but to stay with the defensive intensity." --  Thunder coach  Scott Brooks  on what he told his team at halftime. 
 
 
 THE STAT: Serge Ibaka  was only credited with four blocks, but he altered many other shots as Milwaukee shot just 40.9 percent on attempts in the paint (18-for-44). Ibaka led the league in blocks last season at 3.03 per game but was only averaging 1.75 blocks per game in the early going this season. 
 
 TURNING POINT : An 8-0 run pulled the Bucks within 77-73 with 6:11 left, but Westbrook nailed an open 18-footer to start a 6-1 run that made it 83-74, and the Thunder was never threatened again. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "He's cleaning up everything for us -- rebounding, blocking shots. We want him to keep playing the way he's playing. He's doing everything for us." --  Durant on Ibaka, who finished with 15 points and 20 rebounds . 
 
 
 HOT:  On a night where every starter shot 40 percent or worse and the other three players off the bench shot 33.3 percent or worse, Milwaukee forward  John Henson  made 5 of 8 shots and is shooting 57.9 percent (44-for-76) on the season. He was the only player on either team with more than one attempt to shoot better than 50 percent. 
 
 NOT:  Mayo went 7 for 19, despite making 5 of 11 3-pointers. While Mayo is 24-for-45 on 3-pointers (53.3 percent) he's shooting just 39.1 percent on 2-point shots (36-for-92). 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Ibaka's line of 15 points, 20 rebounds, four blocks and an assist should make some fantasy owners happy.  
 
 GOOD MOVE : Brooks gave  Reggie Jackson  the keys to the offense late in the third quarter and the guard scored nine straight Thunder points. Jackson finished with 11 points and two assists in 20 minutes. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Bucks first-round pick  Giannis Antetokounmpo , who doesn't turn 19 till next month, wowed the crowd with a lob dunk and two blocked shots. He also finished with five rebounds in 15 minutes.  
 
 NOTABLE:  Thunder guard  Thabo Sefalosha  was a game-time scratch with the flu. He was replaced in the starting lineup by  Andre Roberson . ... Oklahoma City finished a three-game road trip and now goes home for a six-game home stand. ... Bucks forward  Ekpe Udoh  had his second career double-double with 11 points and 11 rebounds. Both have come against the Thunder. ... The Bucks had five players out with injuries, including 80 percent of what was their intended starting five at the start of the season -- center  Larry Sanders  (thumb), forwards  Caron Butler  (shoulder) and  Ersan Ilyasova  (ankle) and guard  Brandon Knight  (hamstring). ... Center  Kendrick Perkins  rejoined the Thunder after missing the previous two games for the funeral of his grandfather. ... Ibaka's 20 rebounds tied a career high. ... Westbrook has scored 20 or more points in five of seven games since returning from knee surgery. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Thunder, Monday vs. Denver, Thursday vs. Los Angeles Clippers, Sunday vs. Utah. For the Bucks, Wednesday vs. Portland, Friday @ Philadelphia, Saturday, vs. Charlotte.
