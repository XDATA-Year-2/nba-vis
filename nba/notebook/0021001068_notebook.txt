
 Kings-Pacers notebook   By Conrad Brunner, for NBA.com Posted Friday March 25, 2011 10:50PM THE FACTS:   DeMarcus Cousins  and  Sam Dalembert  combined for 34 points and 24 rebounds as the Kings overpowered the Pacers inside on their way to a 110-93 victory Friday in Conseco Fieldhouse. Sacramento (19-52) won for the third time in four games on its road trip while Indiana (32-41) saw its lead over Milwaukee and Charlotte in the battle for the eighth playoff spot cut to two games as both the Bucks (in New York) and Bobcats (in Boston) picked up wins on the road.  Danny Granger  led a cold-shooting Indiana team, which shot just 35.2 percent, with 20 points. QUOTABLE:  "We came out with a lot of energy. Our effort got us that lead. Defense, energy, effort, everything has been up.''    -- DeMarcus Cousins THE STAT:  Cousins and Dalembert's production dwarfed that of Indiana's starting frontcourt of  Roy Hibbert  and  Tyler Hansbrough , who combined for 19 points and 13 rebounds. TURNING POINT:  Both teams got off to cold starts but the Kings found a way to use Indiana's misfortune to their advantage, fueling their transition game with numerous runouts after Pacers misses in the second period. Cousins had three dunks in a 15-5 run that pushed the lead to 47-30 and the Kings led by at least nine the rest of the way. QUOTABLE II:  "This was a bad loss, a very bad loss."    -- Danny Granger HOT:  The Kings shot 54.2 percent overall and 50 percent from the 3-point line after the first quarter. Cousins had 18 points, 14 rebounds, five assists and three blocks. Dalembert had 16 points, 10 rebounds and two blocks. The Kings had 10 steals and nine blocked shots. NOT:  Indiana missed 16 of its first 19 shots and wound up 4-of-25 from the 3-point line. Granger shot 4-of-13, Hansbrough 3-of-13 and point guards  Darren Collison  and  A.J. Price  combined to shoot 9-of-27. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Former Kings and Pacers center  Scot Pollard  watched from a courtside seat. NOTABLE:   Tyreke Evans  returned for the Kings after missing the previous 19 games with a foot injury, playing 17 minutes off the bench and producing six points (on 2-of-7 shooting) and a game-high eight assists. ... The Pacers fell behind by double digits in the second quarter for the third consecutive game. ... In nine March losses, Indiana's offense has averaged 90.7 points on 39.3 percent shooting. ... The Pacers are 15-14 under interim coach  Frank Vogel  ... Sacramento enjoyed a 64-40 advantage on points in the paint. UP NEXT:  For the Pacers, Saturday @ Detroit, Monday vs. Boston, Wednesday vs. Detroit. For the Kings, Sunday @ Philadelphia, Tuesday vs. Phoenix, Wednesday @ Denver.
