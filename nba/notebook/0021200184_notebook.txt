 THE FACTS:   Byron Mullens  scored 27 points,  Ramon Sessions  had 21 and  Ben Gordon  chipped in with 19 as the Charlotte Bobcats beat the Washington Wizards 108-106 in a double overtime win on Saturday night. 
 
 Reggie Williams  hit a 3-pointer with 1:18 to play in double overtime to give the Bobcats a 104-103 lead. Charlotte is now 7-5. Last season, the Bobcats had a 7-59 record, the lowest percentage in NBA history. Washington is now 0-11. 
 The Wizards were led by  Martell Webster 's 21 points and  Nene 's 19. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I said if we have to take a third overtime, and you don't like this moment, sub yourselves out because I love it personally," 
 -- Bobcats coach  Mike Dunlap 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Wizards are the 12th team to start the season 0-11 according to STATS LLC. The 2009-10 New Jersey Nets have the all-time worst start, 0-18. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Williams' 3-pointer was the only field goal he made. He was playing only because  Michael Kidd-Gilchrist ,  Jeff Taylor  and Gordon had fouled out. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I'm not pointing a finger at my players. Obviously, it lies with me, I know it lies with me and I need to figure a way out to get this righted. That's what my job is and I'll take full responsibility for that." 
 -- Wizards coach  Randy Wittman 
 
 
 HOT:  Nene was 8-for-13 in the field in 29 minutes. It was just his second game back after missing nine games with a foot injury. 
 
 NOT:    Kemba Walker  was just 3-for-17 from the field, but hit three free throws in the second overtime. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Dunlap playing Mullens nearly 46 minutes, 13 more than he's been averaging. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Wittman had intended to limit Nene to 20 minutes because of his sore left foot. He played 29 minutes, and it won't be a surprise if it has to sit out a game or two.   
 
 NOTABLE:  The Wizards have lost their 11 games by a total of 72 points, an average of just over 6.5 a game. 
 
 IN THE ARENA:  A fan held a sign up that read: "All I want 4 Christmas is a win." The 0-11 Wizards have 14 games between now and Dec. 25.  
 
 NEXT:  For the Bobcats, Monday @ Oklahoma City, Wednesday @ Atlanta, Friday vs. Philadelphia. For the Wizards, Monday vs. San Antonio, Wednesday vs. Portland, Friday @ New York.
