 THE FACTS:  The Golden State Warriors (27-17) defeated the Toronto Raptors (16-29) 114-102 at Air Canada Centre Monday night. The Warriors snapped a two-game losing streak with a balanced effort with seven players in double-digits. The Warriors were led by All-Star  David Lee's  team highs of 21 points,12 rebounds and seven assists.  Klay Thompson  added 19 points and six rebounds while  Stephen Curry  scored 17 points before leaving the game in the third quarter with a twisted right ankle.  Harrison Barnes  and  Jarrett Jack  both scored 14 points while  Carl Landry  added 12 points off the bench.  Andrew Bogut  returned to the line-up, starting for the Warriors, playing in his first game since November 7 with an ankle injury and scored 12 points, eight rebounds and four blocks. 
 With teams deadlocked at 52-52 at the half, the Warriors went on a 10-2 run early in the third quarter, but the Raptors matched it with their own 10-2 run to take a 79-77 lead with 2:10 left. However, former Raptor Jack went on a 5-2 run of his own, substituting for Curry who left the game and closed out the quarter with an 84-82 Warriors lead. The fourth quarter was all Golden State as they started on a 16-5 run stretching their lead to the largest of the game of 13 points at 100-87. The Raptors got as close as nine points, but were held to .304 percent for the quarter, and suffered their seventh loss in nine games. 
 Toronto was led by  Aaron Gray's  career-high 22-point game and season-high 10 rebounds.  DeMar DeRozan  added 21 points and a career-high nine assists, while  Ed Davis  scored 12 rebounds and nine points.  Alan Anderson  and  Terrence Ross  both added 11 points a piece from the bench. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "He was great, you can tell we're a different basketball team with him on the floor. It's great to have him, makes me a better coach. He makes guys better and completes us as a team" --  Warriors head coach  Mark Jackson  on Bogut's return. 
 
 
 
 THE STAT:  With Bogut, Lee and Landry working the blocks, they presented an overwhelming advantage for the Warriors outscoring the Raptors in the paint 62-34.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  Despite a close game with numerous lead changes, Thompson stole the ball from  Jose Calderon  and fed Barnes for a fast break dunk to put the Warriors up 107-96 with 1:22 left in the game, shutting the door on any Raptors comeback.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It's been a long season so far, a frustrating season both mentally and physically. Just to be out there running up and down the court again, especially getting the win is very satisfying." --  Warriors center Bogut on being back in the lineup. 
 
 
 HOT:  Gray got the start tonight to match up defensively against Bogut, but his offensive output was unexpected with 14 points on 6-for-7 shooting, seven rebounds and two steals in the first half alone. Eclipsing his previous season-highs of seven points, five rebounds and one steal. He finished with a career-high 22 points on 9-for-12 shooting and a season high 10 rebounds. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Golden State is 11-3 in the last 14 meetings with Toronto. The Warriors have scored 100+ points in 13 of those 14 games. Lee is tied for the league lead in double-doubles with 28 this season ( Zach Randolph ).  Landry Fields  left the game at halftime with flu like symptoms and did not return. Curry twisted his right ankle with 3:53 in the third quarter and did not return. Golden State is now 14-5 against Eastern Conference opponents and 5-0 against the Atlantic Division. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Raptors; Wednesday @ Atlanta, Friday vs. Clippers, Sunday vs. Miami. For the Warriors; Tuesday @ Cleveland, Thursday vs. Dallas and Saturday @ Phoenix.
