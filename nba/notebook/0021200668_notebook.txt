 THE FACTS: LaMarcus Aldridge 's 18-foot turnaround baseline jumper at the buzzer gave Portland a 106-104 victory over Dallas Tuesday night at the Rose Garden,  
 Aldridge's game-winner capped an epic comeback as the Trail Blazers (23-22) rallied from deficits of 21 points in the third quarter and seven points with two minutes to play. 
 Aldridge scored 29 points and grabbed 13 rebounds for Portland, which won for the third time in four games after losing six in a row.  J.J. Hickson  added a season-high 26 points and hauled in 15 boards for the Blazers. 
 
 Dirk Nowitzki  scored a season-high 26 points for the Mavericks (19-26). 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I can't get tired of appreciating what our team does as far as competing and never giving up. We've seen it a number of times this year, but it never gets old."  
 -- Blazers coach  Terry Stotts , whose Blazers are 13-8 in games decided by six points or fewer this season 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Aldridge was 0-for-9 from 3-point range this season until hitting a three from the corner with 4.5 seconds left to tie the score at 104-104. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Portland trailed 69-48 early in the third quarter but, behind Aldridge, outscored the Mavericks 26-11 the rest of the quarter to go into the final period down only 80-74. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "The difference between a good team and a bad team is just a couple of possessions down the stretch of a close game. For some reason, we haven't found a way to win those games consistently."  
 -- Dirk Nowitzki 
 
 
 HOT:  Aldridge finished 12-for-20 from the field and was 3-for-4 in the fourth quarter, including a 3-pointer to tie the game and a 2-point basket to win it in the final 4.5 seconds. 
 
 NOT:  The Blazers won despite poor shooting games from  Nicolas Batum  (4-for-14) and  Damian Lillard  (3-for-13). 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Stotts, who drew up plays on Portland's final three possessions for Batum despite his troubles. Batum nailed a 3-pointer on the first possession, assisted Aldridge on the second and served as an important decoy on the game-winning shot by Aldridge. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Dallas'  O.J. Mayo  drove hard to the basket but was out of control, drawing an offensive charge against Portland's  Ronnie Price  with the score tied at 104-104 and 1.5 seconds left.  
 
 NOTABLE:  Playing in his 18th game since his return from knee surgery, Nowitzki hit the 20-point mark for only the third time this season. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "He said he had a lot of faith in me. That's good, because I didn't know yet. I was waiting for it to go in."  
 -- LaMarcus Aldridge on Batum, who was racing across the court with arms extending, celebrating even before Aldridge's game-winner went through the net
