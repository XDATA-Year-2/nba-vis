 THE FACT:  After a rough shooting start, the Oklahoma City Thunder held on to beat the Sacramento Kings at Sleep Train Arena on Tuesday.  The Thunder have now won seven straight against the Kings and eight in a row overall.  
 
 THE LEAD:  The Kings (4-12) made a late run at Oklahoma City (13-3), outscoring the Thunder 30-19 in the fourth quarter.  But experience won out in the end.   Kevin Durant  and his teammates came out on top with a hard-fought 97-95 victory.  
 Durant led all scorers with 27 points and a team-high 11 rebounds.   Russell Westbrook  kicked in 15 points, eight rebounds and seven assists.  Serge Ibaka  added 13 points and nine rebounds, while  Jeremy Lamb  added 14 points of the bench. 
 Playing without leading scorer and rebounder  DeMarcus Cousins  (sprained right ankle), the Kings turned to  Isaiah Thomas  late and the 5-foot-9 super-sub almost pulled off the miracle.  
 Thomas scored 21 of his team-high 24 points in a riveting fourth quarter.   Ben McLemore  scored 14 points and  Derrick Williams  played well in his third game with the Kings, finishing with 13 points on 5-for-10 shooting. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We just have to be better.  Of course we can never take a win for granted.  It's hard to win in this league."  
 -- Kevin Durant 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Without Cousins, the Thunder outscored the Kings 40-26 in the paint.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Thunder used a 18-0 run in the late third and early fourth quarter to take a 17-point lead. 
 
 HOT:  Thomas struggled early on, but caught fire in the fourth quarter, scoring 21 points on 8-for-14 shooting in the final frame.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "When I got in in the beginning of the third and the fourth, I just wanted to try to make a difference.  I was aggressive.  We got in the bonus early and I was just in attack mode and my teammates kept finding me."  
 -- Isaiah Thomas 
 
 
 NOT:  The Thunder couldn't buy a basket in first quarter, finishing just 7-for-27 (25.9 percent) from the floor in the games first 12 minutes.   
 
 NOT II:   Patrick Patterson  struggled all night long, scoring just three points on 1-for-9 shooting.  
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Kings coach  M ichael Malone  put his trust in Thomas and he almost delivered.  
 
 NOTABLE:  Durant has scored 20 points or more in 14 of the Thunder's 16 games this season. 
 
 NOTABLE II:  Cousins missed his first game of the season with a sprained right ankle.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Thunder, Wednesday @ Portland, Friday @ New Orleans, Sunday vs. Indiana. For the Kings, Friday vs. L.A. Lakers, Saturday @ Utah, Monday vs. Dallas.
