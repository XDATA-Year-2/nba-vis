 THE FACT:  The Pelicans have their first three-game winning streak of the year and only their third since the start of the 2011-12 season.  
 
 THE LEAD:  Trailing 93-81 at the 4:30 mark of the fourth quarter, New Orleans scored 23 points the rest of the way to rally past Cleveland 104-100, getting the go-ahead basket on  Eric Gordon 's 3-pointer from the wing with 31.7 seconds left. Cavaliers guard  Kyrie Irving  tried to tie the score on a drive to the basket but ran into Pelicans center  Anthony Davis , and the ball popped loose.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "The fans were leaving, and it rubs you the wrong way." 
 -- Pelicans coach  Monty Williams  
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Pelicans scored 25 second-chance points to the Cavaliers' eight, including a Davis tip-in that tied the score at 95 with 1:29 left.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  After getting crushed on penetration by backup point guard Jarrett Jack, who scored nine points and had three assists in the in the first five minutes of the fourth quarter, the Pelicans begin stopping the ball. Jack, who played In New Orleans in 2010-11 and 2011-12, did not score or have an assist the rest of the way, and Irving had three shots blocked down the stretch.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We made some big plays offensively, but the key was stopping the ball in the last five minutes." 
 -- Pelicans point guard  Jrue Holiday  
 
 
 HOT:  Since handing the Utah Jazz what remains their only win on Nov. 13, the Pelicans have averaged 112.6 points in their three consecutive victories while climbing back to .500.  
 
 NOT:  After scoring eight points in the first five minutes, Cleveland center  Andrew Bynum  was blanked the rest of the way.  
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Williams went with a lineup of Davis, Gordon and Jrue Holiday along with reserves  Tyreke Evans  and  Ryan Anderson  during the pivotal run, giving New Orleans five legitimate scorers. All five scored in the final two minutes. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Cavs went away from Jack and almost exclusively to Irving after building their 12-point lead. Normally that's sound strategy, since Irving leads the NBA in fourth-quarter scoring, but Jack had a hot hand, hitting 9 of 13 shots. Irving went 9 of 22.  
 
 NOTABLE:  Williams earned his 100th win as a coach. ... Davis, who had 17 blocked shots in has last two games, managed only three this time. ...Holiday had seven points and five assists in the fourth quarter.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Cavaliers, Saturday @ Spurs, Wednesday vs. Heat, Friday @ Celtics. For the Pelicans, Monday @ Spurs, Tuesday vs. Warriors, Friday @ 76ers.
