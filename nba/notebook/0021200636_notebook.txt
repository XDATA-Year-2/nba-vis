 THE FACTS:  Led by a season-high 25 points from  Kirk Hinrich , the host Chicago Bulls led from the start and ran away with a 103-87 victory over the Golden State Warriors on Friday.  Nate Robinson , the current backup point guard behind Hinrich, had 22 points off the bench, while all three Bulls starters in the frontcourt had double-doubles:  Jimmy Butler  (16 points, 12 rebounds),  Carlos Boozer  (15 points, 13 rebounds) and  Joakim Noah  (14 points, 16 rebounds). The Warriors were led by new All-Star  David Lee  with 23 points, while  Stephen Curry  had 21 points. 
 
 THE FACTS II:  The game was decided in the first quarter, when the Bulls shot 54 percent, the Warriors shot 23 percent, the Bulls outrebounded the Warriors 21-7 and took a 31-13 lead. The Warriors never got the difference below double digits the rest of the game.  
 
 QUOTABLE I:  "Joakim's energy runs off on the other guys on the court. When you see him rebounding and yelling, you go in and rebound so you can yell." 
  -- Bulls forward Jimmy Butler.  
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Bulls shot 45 percent from 3-point range (nine for 20), with Hinrich going six for seven.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "That's the most I've taken this season. That's the most I've made." 
  -- Bulls guard  Kirk Hinrich  on his 3-point shooting. His six made 3-pointers tied his career high.   
 
 
 THE STAT II:  The Bulls outrebounded the Warriors 56-37. They had 16 offensive boards and had 30 second-chance points. 
 
 THE STAT III:  The Warriors lost by 16, but they outscored the Bulls from the free throw line 29-12. They were 29-for-33 from the line (the Bulls were 12 for 18). 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Warriors got the difference down to 10 points, 65-55, with nine minutes left in the third quarter, but missed their next six shots, and the Bulls built a 75-58 lead. 
 
 INJURY UPDATE:   Luol Deng  missed his fourth consecutive game with a sore right hamstring, but reports indicate he may play Saturday in Washington against the Wizards. The Bulls are 3-1 in his absence with Butler starting in Deng's place. 
 
 HOT:  Bulls guard Robinson made 10-of-16 shots from the field for his 22 points.  
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "We got outworked. We didn't have the right mindset to start the game and it snowballed from there. That wasn't Warriors basketball." 
 
 -- Golden State coach  Mark Jackson .  
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Bulls coach  Tom Thibodeau  took the harness off the Bulls' offense Friday. They scored a season-high 63 points in the first half.  
 
 ODD OFFICIATING:  The second half started with four offensive fouls called in the first 57 seconds. Three minutes later, the officiating crew of  Bill Kennedy ,  John Goble  and  Olandis Poole  called traveling on three consecutive possessions over 33 seconds. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The United Center gets regular visits from former Second City performers who went on to star on Saturday Night Live. On Friday, it was  Tim Meadows ' turn to show up. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  The Warriors' starting rookie forward  Harrison Barnes  missed all four shots he took and finished with three points in 22 minutes. Rookie center  Festus Ezeli  played just nine minutes because of foul trouble and did not score. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Bulls have won six of their last seven games and are 10 games over .500 for the first time this season... Butler's double-double was the first of his two-year NBA career... the game Friday started a stretch for Golden State in which it plays 14 of 19 games on the road... The Bulls have won 40 straight games in which they scored 100 points, one win away from tying the NBA record... the Bulls have a chance for their first four-game win streak of the season when they face Washington Saturday.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Bulls, @ Washington Saturday, vs. Bobcats Monday, @ Milwaukee Wednesday. For the Warriors, @ Milwaukee Saturday, @ Toronto Monday, @ Cleveland Tuesday.
