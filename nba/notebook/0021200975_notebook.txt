 THE FACTS: LeBron James  scored 28 points and added 10 rebounds and seven assists, and  Chris Bosh  also had 28 points as the Miami Heat won their 21st straight game, a 107-94 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks Friday night at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. 
 
 Dwyane Wade  added 20 points as Miami (50-14) surpassed the 20-game winning streaks of Milwaukee in 1971 and the Washington Capitols spanning the end of the 1947-'48 season and the start of the 1948-'49 season. Only the Los Angeles Lakers (33 straight in 1971-'72) and the Houston Rockets (22 straight in 2008) have longer winning streaks. 
 
 Ersan Ilyasova  had 26 points and 17 rebounds, but the Bucks (32-32) lost their third straight game after winning six of seven. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I don't remember much from when I was doing it, but when I watched it I saw his hip hit me in the head and I went down fast. Luckily I was able to come back in here [the locker room] and the doctors made sure I was fine." 
 -- Dwyane Wade on a collision with Milwaukee's  Larry Sanders  in the first quarter that sent him briefly to the locker room 
 
 
 THE STAT:  For the second straight game -- not surprisingly, both losses -- the Bucks did not attempt a free throw in the first half. That led to some frustration as Ilyasova was hit with a technical foul after being slammed across the arm with no call with 27 seconds left in the second quarter, and coach  Jim Boylan  was hit with one 15 seconds into the third quarter after  Monta Ellis  went hard to the hoop with no call. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Wade went to the locker room with 7:20 left in the first quarter. When he returned with 7:45 left in the second period the score was tied at 34. He scored the next four points to start a 12-2 run and the Heat never led by less than six the rest of the way. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I've been in the right place at the right time. I've been on the right teams at the right times. I'm very fortunate and blessed to have unbelievable teammates and guys who care about winning. That's all it is." 
 -- Miami forward  Shane Battier , who was also with Houston when the Rockets won 22 straight 
 
 
 HOT:  Bosh did the great majority of his damage from outside. Of his 12 field goals, eight were from at least 18 feet, with two of them being 3-pointers. He finished 12-for-16 from the field, 2-for-3 on 3-pointers. 
 
 NOT:  The Bucks have five players averaging double-figure scoring. Other than Ilyasova's 10-for-20 shooting, the other four -- Ellis,  Brandon Jennings ,  J.J. Redick  and  Mike Dunleavy  -- combined to go 13-for-39. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  After the Bucks pulled within 85-79 in the fourth quarter, Wade drove the lane and kicked it out to a wide open Battier, whose 3-pointer started a 10-2 run that put the game out of reach. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Sanders was hit with two technicals with 2:44 left for his fourth ejection of the season and his second in as many games. He also was ejected Wednesday night in a 106-93 loss at Washington after giving each of the three referees a sarcastic thumbs-up with 2:45 left in that game. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Bucks forward  John Henson  saw some time guarding James -- not with great success -- but was a factor on the offensive boards in the first half with three, including a tip-in.   
 
 NOTABLE: Marquis Daniels  started in place of injured  Luc Richard Mbah a Moute  (toe) mostly for defensive reasons -- to guard James -- but scored the Bucks' first eight points. ... The Bucks ended the Los Angeles Lakers' 33-game winning streak in 1972. If the Heat continue winning, the Bucks would meet them in Miami on April 9 with a 33-game winning streak. ... The game marked the Bucks second sellout of the season. The other also was against the Heat on Dec. 29. ... The Heat was whistled for just two fouls -- one offensive -- in the first half.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Heat, Sunday @ Toronto, Monday @ Boston, Wednesday @ Cleveland. For the Bucks, Sunday vs. Orlando, Tuesday vs. Portland, Wednesday @ Atlanta.
