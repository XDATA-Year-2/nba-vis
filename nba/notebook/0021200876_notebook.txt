 THE FACTS: Evan Turner  had 22 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists,  Jrue Holiday  led the way with 27 points and the Philadelphia 76ers overcame a double-digit second-half deficit to beat the Golden State Warriors 104-97 at the Wells Fargo Center on Saturday night. 
 
 Royal Ivey  had 17 points and  Thaddeus Young  added 14 points and 16 rebounds as Philadelphia snapped a seven-game losing streak. 
 
 Stephen Curry  led the struggling Warriors with 30 points and  Klay Thompson  contributed 29 in the team's fourth straight loss and 10th defeat in 13 games. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Our past few games the ball has gone in and out. Obviously, when shots are going in, you're more lethal and that's pretty much it." --  Turner on team's turnaround. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Sixers were 12-of-18 from 3-point range, including 6-of-7 in the second quarter when they trimmed a 16-point deficit to three by halftime. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Turner hit consecutive jumpers to give the Sixers a 100-94 lead late in the fourth. After a 3-pointer by Thompson, Turner made a turnover but a traveling call on Curry gave the Sixers the ball and Holiday hit a jumper to ice it with 41.9 seconds left. 
 
 HOT:  Turner was 10-of-15, Ivey was 6-for-6 and Holiday was 11-for-20. For Golden State, Curry was 11-for-20 and Thompson was 11-for-18. 
 
 NOT: Spencer Hawes  was 0-for-9 for Philadelphia.  Jarrett Jack  was 3-for-13 for the Warriors. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "He's a great player, he's relentless, he knocks down the 3s and he gets to the foul line. I did my best. He still got 30, but we got the win." 
 --  Ivey on guarding Curry. 
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Turner fell one assist shy of his first career triple-double, with 22 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA: Andrew Bynum  was on the bench for the Sixers one day after he revealed that he might not play at all this season. The former All-Star center, acquired from the Los Angeles Lakers in a three-team trade last summer, has yet to make his Sixers debut because of bilateral bone bruises in both knees. Bynum is making $16.5 million this season in the final year of his contract. He'll be a free agent after the season. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "We got away from who we are. We were careless, we turned the basketball over, we didn't defend at the same level. We made mistakes, let go of the rope and we paid the price because any team in this league, when you don't put them away and allow them to gain some life, you're dealing with a different animal." 
 --  Warriors coach  Mark Jackson  on wasting a big lead. 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Sixers coach  Doug Collins'  decision to start Ivey for the injured  Nick Young . Ivey didn't miss a shot from the floor, made all four of his 3-pointers and finished two points short of tying his career high. He missed 2 of 3 free throws. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Warriors left the Sixers open beyond the arc late in the second quarter and it backfired. Philadelphia made three straight 3-pointers and four of five in the final four minutes of the second quarter to trim a 16-point deficit to 54-51 at halftime. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Warriors forward  Harrison Barnes  had five points and three rebounds in 28:14, center  Festus Ezeli  had two points and four rebounds in 20 minutes and  Draymond Green  missed his only two shots in 7:35.  Kent Bazemore  played 3:39 and was 0-for-1. For the Sixers,  Arnett Moultrie  scored four points in 7:52. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Warriors return home to play their next seven games after completing a five-game road trip. ... Curry has scored 25 points in four straight games. ... The Sixers are 21-1 when leading after three quarters. ... Holiday has scored 20 or more points 23 times this season after doing it 10 times in 2011-12. ... Philadelphia won despite a season-high 23 turnovers.  
 
 NEXT:  For the Warriors, Monday vs. Toronto, Wednesday vs. Sacramento, Friday vs. Houston. For the Sixers, Sunday @ Washington, Tuesday vs. Boston, Wednesday @ Atlanta.
