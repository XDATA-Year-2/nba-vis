  Raptors-Spurs notebook   By Tim Price, for NBA.com Posted Thursday January 20, 2011 12:28AM THE FACTS: Manu Ginobili 's 23 points, which included 14-of-14 from the foul line, and  DeJuan Blair 's season-high 22 points along with 11 rebounds pulled the Spurs out of an 11-point halftime deficit on the way to a 104-95 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday at AT&T Center. San Antonio (36-6) has won 16 straight at home. The Raptors (13-29) have lost five straight. QUOTABLE:  "In the second half we got back in the game because we played very, very good team defense. Those stops generated offense, and that was the ballgame."    -- Spurs coach  Gregg Popovich THE STAT:  Blair went 6-for-8 from the floor and had three offensive rebounds in the third quarter (he already had five in the first half) to score 12 points in a 33-16 third quarter for the Spurs. TURNING POINT: DeMar DeRozan  scored 20 points off 8-for-11 shooting as the Raptors built an 11-point halftime lead. But the Spurs defense paid attention to him in the third quarter, limiting DeRozan to four points off 1-for-5 shooting as the Spurs used that 33-16 third quarter to lead by six going into the final 12 minutes. QUOTABLE II:  "I don't know if it was our inability to stop them as much as our inability to score as the game went on. We just had a hard time scoring. We became one dimensional. DeMar (DeRozan) was the only one to score for us."    -- Raptors coach  Jay Triano HOT:  Ginobili's 14-for-14 showing from the foul line now makes him 34-for-34 the past five games. But he was 4-for-13 from the floor and now is shooting 13-for-43 (30 percent) the past three games. NOT:  After three straight games where he hit 12 shots from the field and was 50 percent from the floor in two of those,  Andrea Bargnani  has cooled down. He went 6-for-20 against the Spurs, and he's 19-for-61 (31 percent) the past three games. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  This is the second time in the last three games that Blair has had a double-double. He had 18 points and 13 rebounds against Dallas before a three-point and four-rebound performance in 14 1/2 minutes Sunday against Denver. GOOD MOVE:  The Spurs ran double teams at DeRozan in the third quarter. The Spurs simply went after DeRozan like they did  Carmelo Anthony  when the Nuggets were in town on Sunday and limited 'Melo to a 2-for-11 first half. BAD MOVE:  Popovich credited Triano with a good gameplan that was executed with physical play in the first half. But the Raptors lost that edge in the third quarter when they got outrebounded 15-4 in the critical third quarter. ROOKIE WATCH: Gary Neal  had a subpar shooting night overall for the Spurs (3-for-11), but he did make 2-of-4 3-pointers.  Larry Owens , signed to a 10-day contract this week by the Spurs, checked in midway through the second quarter. He finished the game with a rebound and a foul in almost two minutes of play. He got more playing time than  Tiago Splitter , the Spurs' former No. 1 draft choice after two seasons in Europe.  Ed Davis  had a goaltending call against him when the Spurs were pulling close in the third quarter, but he led the Raptors with 11 rebounds in 26 1/2 minutes. NOTABLE:  The Spurs were 4-for-5 to open the game with a 10-0 lead, then missed 17 of 20 the rest of the first quarter and early into the second. By halftime, the Spurs weren't even shooting 35 percent and trailed by 11. UP NEXT:  For the Raptors, Friday @ Orlando, Saturday @ Miami, Monday vs. Memphis. For the Spurs, Friday vs. New York, Saturday @ New Orleans, Monday @ Golden State.
