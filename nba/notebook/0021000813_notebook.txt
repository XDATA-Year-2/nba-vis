  Spurs-Nets notebook   By Jake Appleman, for NBA.com Posted Monday February 14, 2011 10:48PM THE FACTS:  Playing smart and coming through at the end of quarters, the Spurs clobbered the Nets 102-85 at Prudential Center.  Tim Duncan  (15 points, 11 rebounds, three blocks) and  Manu Ginobili  (22 points, 4 rebounds, 3 assists) led the Spurs while  Brook Lopez  (11 points, 10 rebounds) managed a rare -- for him -- double-double in defeat. QUOTABLE:  "On the road you play those teams, you know you're supposed to win. It's very important to jump on them and start aggressive and make sure you get an early lead."   --  Spurs point guard  Tony Parker THE STAT:  No Net with more than five field goal attempts shot over 50 percent for the game. TURNING POINT :  Gary Neal  squashed any potential Nets comeback with a wing 3-pointer to put the Spurs up 75-66 late in the third quarter. QUOTABLE II:  "We can't shoot 34 percent and expect to win a game like this against this team."   --  Nets coach  Avery Johnson FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:   George Hill  (13 points, 4 rebounds) was effective off the bench for the Spurs. INSIDE THE ARENA:   Derrick Favors  greeted the crowd before the game, wishing them a Happy Valentine's day and urging them to check him out in the Rookie/Sophomore challenge during All-Star Weekend... Jim Cramer  of "Mad Money" sat courtside. ROOKIE WATCH:  Favors (four points, four rebounds) struggled with early foul trouble while Neal (11 points) buried clutch jumpers and fit in well for the Spurs. NOTABLE:  The Spurs wore home white jerseys and the Nets wore alternate road red jerseys...The Spurs are now 34-3 when scoring 100+ points and 38-0 when shooting a higher field goal percentage than their opponent...No Net scored more than 11 points. UP NEXT:  For the Spurs, Thursday @ Chicago, Wednesday 23rd vs. Oklahoma City, Friday 25th vs. New Jersey. For the Nets, Wednesday @ Boston, Friday 25th @ San Antonio, Saturday 26th @ Houston.
