 THE FACT:   In his first regular-season game in more than nine months, Indiana's  Danny Granger  played 22:05 and produced five points on 1-for-7 shooting, two rebounds, two assists, one steal, one blocked shot and five turnovers. 
 
 THE LEAD:  The idea of a losing streak did not sit well with the Indiana Pacers. Racking up a season-high in points while holding Houston to a season-low point total, the Pacers rolled to a 114-81 victory over the visitors before a sellout crowd of 18,165 at Bankers Life Fieldhouse.  Paul George  scored 24 with nine rebounds for the Pacers (21-5), who were coming off consecutive losses for the first time this season.  Lance Stephenson  had 16.  Dwight Howard  had 19 points, 12 rebounds and five blocks for the Rockets (17-10). Indiana's victory margin of 33 matched the jersey number of Granger, who made his season debut after recovering from offseason knee surgery and, most recently, a calf strain. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "This team doesn't like losing and we had lost two in a row. We talked about playing mad and they played mad for four quarters." 
 -- Indiana coach  Frank Vogel 
 
 
 THE STAT:   Houston's leading scorer,  James Harden , managed just 12 points on 3-for-14 shooting. In his last six games against Indiana, Harden has shot 22-for-81 (.271), including 10-for-34 (.294) from the 3-point line, while committing 21 turnovers. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Houston put together a 10-0 run midway through the second quarter to cut the Indiana lead to 41-39, but that's where the Pacers took over. Spurred by consecutive 3-pointers from  George Hill , Indiana proceeded to go on a 40-16 spree bridging intermission to push the lead to 81-55. George had 15 points and Hill 12 in the run as Indiana shot 15-for-23 (.652) while holding the Rockets to 5-for-17 (.294). 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It felt good just to be back out playing again. I knew it was going to take a long time to get in a groove. I was just happy I made one shot, honestly." 
 -- Granger 
 
 
 HOT:   Indiana shot 12-for-26 (.462) from the 3-point line. ... Pacers reserves  Luis Scola ,  C.J. Watson  and  Ian Mahinmi  combined for 31 points on 12-for-15 shooting. ...  David West  shot 6-for-8, as did Houston's  Chandler Parsons . ... Howard was 9-for-16. 
 
 NOT:  Houston's  Omri Casspi  shot 1-for-10, including 1-for-7 from the arc, while  Aaron Brooks  missed all seven of his shots. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "They are a well-seasoned team. You can tell they've been together for a couple of years. You can tell in certain situations on the floor when they would run the same play several times in a row but with a different wrinkle and they were able to score every time. They kicked our (deleted)."  
 -- Howard 
 
 
 NOTABLE:   Granger received a standing ovation when he checked in for the first time with 4:05 left in the first quarter, and immediately produced a blind-side block of Howard in the post. ... Scola made his first 3-pointer of the season and just the fifth of his career in the second period. ... Houston leads the NBA in 3-pointers attempted (27) and made (9.5) per game but was just 4-for-22 against the Pacers. ... The margin was also the biggest in Pacers-Rockets series history. ... Indiana had a season-high 41 bench points and pulled at least 50 rebounds for the sixth time. ... Houston has lost four in a row to Indiana. ... Scola scored 13 with six rebounds in 16 minutes against his former team. ... West and Hill scored 12 each while Mahinmi had 10 for Indiana. ....  Chandler Parsons  scored 14 and  Terence Jones  10 for the Rockets. ... Houston lost for just the second time in 10 games against Eastern Conference teams. ...  Jeremy Lin  missed his third consecutive game with back spasms for Houston.  Omer Asik  (right thigh contusion) did not make the trip. ...  Solomon Hill  was inactive for Indiana. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Pacers, Sunday vs. Boston, Monday at Brooklyn, Saturday at Brooklyn. For the Rockets, Saturday at Detroit, Monday vs. Dallas, Wednesday at San Antonio.
