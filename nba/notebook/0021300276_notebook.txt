 THE FACT:  Portland's 16-3 record is the best in the Western Conference and second best in the NBA. It's the second-fastest start in franchise history (18-1 in 1990-91). 
 
 THE LEAD: LaMarcus Aldridge  delivered an MVP-esque performance, scoring 38 points and grabbing 13 rebounds in Portland's 111-104 victory over Oklahoma City at the Moda Center. 
   The 6-foot-11 two-time All-Star scored 26 points in the second half as the Trail Blazers rallied from an 11-point halftime deficit to beat the Thunder (13-4). Aldridge was 17-for-28 from the field and 4-for-4 from the line. 
  All four of Portland's other starters scored between 14 and 12 points.  Nicolas Batum  and  Damian Lillard  each had 14,  Wesley Matthews  13 and  Robin Lopez  12. 
 
 Kevin Durant  scored 33 points and  Russell Westbrook  added 21 for OKC, which saw the end to an eight-game win streak. 
 
   QUOTABLE:  "It was just surreal. It was humbling to have that moment here. I've been here so long, and I've had very few of those chances. That was fun. That made the night complete for me."  
 -- LaMarcus Aldridge on fans chanting "M-V-P!" 
 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Down 59-48 at halftime, the Blazers dominated the third quarter, outscoring the Thunder 35-21 to take an 83-80 lead into the final period.  
 
 HOT:  Aldridge had one of the greatest quarters of his career in the third quarter, scoring 16 points on 8-for-9 from the field while hauling in five rebounds. Portland was 15-for-24 in the quarter. 
 
 NOT:  OKC started the third quarter 5-for-16 as the visitors saw all of their 11-point halftime lead slip away. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We had a nice run. We came here and played one of the best teams in their building and played them down to the wire. We gave ourselves a chance to win. We have to come back and regroup for Friday's game" against New Orleans."  
 -- Oklahoma City coach  Scott Brooks   
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  With Portland ahead 88-84 and less than nine minutes remaining, OKC's  Jeremy Lamb  stole the ball and headed downcourt for a dunk attempt. Portland's  Dorell Wright  chased him down and affected the shot enough to make Lamb miss. Thunder guard  Derek Fisher , following the play, rebounded, but the Blazers'  Damian Lillard  was there, too, and Fisher missed the layup. The Blazers rebounded, getting the ball to Lillard for a 3-pointer and a 91-84 lead. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Thunder fronted Aldridge and brought back-side double-team help in the second quarter, shutting him out. After that, they mostly played him straight away, and he burned them for 26 second-half points. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:   "He's the best power forward in the game. He's got to be getting MVP votes with the way we're playing, with the level he's playing at. He's willing us [to win] right now."  
 -- Wesley Matthews on Aldridge 
 
 
 NOTABLE:   Aldridge had his ninth double-double of the season. ... His career-high 17 field goals tied New York's  Carmelo Anthony  for the most made in a game this season. ... Durant has scored at least 20 points in 15 of OKC's 17 games. He had seven rebounds, ending a four-game string of 20-10 performances.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Thunder, Friday @ New Orleans, Sunday vs. Indiana, Tuesday @ Atlanta. For the Trail Blazers, Friday vs. Utah, Saturday vs. Dallas, Monday @ Utah.
