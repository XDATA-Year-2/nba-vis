 THE FACTS:  After watching  Jeremy Lin  and the Houston Rockets overcome a big fourth-quarter lead,  Dirk Nowitzki  and the Dallas Mavericks buckled down on defense and grinded out a 105-100 victory on Wednesday at the American Airlines Center. Dallas (17-23) extended its season-long winning streak to four games and handed Houston (21-19) its fifth straight loss. It was the Mavericks' ninth consecutive win against their intrastate rivals, their longest active streak against any opponent. 
 Nowitzki scored 10 of his team-high 19 points in the fourth quarter.  O.J. Mayo  had 18 points and eight assists,  Shawn Marion  tallied 18 points and nine rebounds and  Elton Brand  collected his 400th career double-double with 11 points and 10 boards off the bench.  Darren Collison  and rookie  Jae Crowder  also scored in double figures with 10 each. 
 Lin scored 14 of his 19 points in the fourth quarter.  James Harden  had 20 points, eight rebounds, seven assists and three steals, but was just 5-for-23 from the field.  Omer Asik  got his 16th double-double of the season with 12 points and 15 boards, and  Chandler Parsons  scored 18 points. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We really stepped up tonight. They lead the league in offense with 105 a game and we tried to keep them under 100. We got big stops, big rebounds and big blocks when we needed it. We did well because they have a heck of an offensive team." 
 -- Mavericks forward Brand 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Harden extended his streak to 22 consecutive games with at least 20 points, but he needed 23 shots to get there. He was 1-for-8 from 3-point distance. Harden's streak is the longest for Houston since  Hakeem Olajuwon  scored 20-plus in 24 consecutive games from Jan. 24-March 13, 1995. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  After Houston erased an 11-point deficit with a 15-4 run to knot the score at 97-97, the Mavericks put together three consecutive defensive stops in the final minute to thwart the rally. Brand had a huge blocked shot against a driving Harden on one trip, and  Dahntay Jones  intercepted an errant pass by Lin on another. Nowitzki, Jones and Mayo each made a pair of free throws in the final 25 seconds to ice the victory. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "James played hard. He got to the line 12 times, had some looks that he'd normally make and missed some, but you're going to have nights like that." 
 -- Rockets head coach  Kevin McHale 
 
 
 HOT:  In the fourth quarter, Harden and Lin combined for 23 points and one turnover. Lin went 4-for-4 from the field, including a 3-pointer. 
 
 NOT:  Through the first three quarters, Harden and Lin were a combined 5-for-23 from the field (0-for-7 3-pointers) with 16 points and seven turnovers. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Rockets turned the ball over seven times during a 19-0 run by the Mavericks in the first quarter. Dallas scored 12 points off nine turnovers in the opening period as Houston looked lethargic out of the gates on the second night of a back-to-back. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  After tying his career high with 40 points in the first meeting against the Rockets, a 116-109 win at Houston on Dec. 8, Mayo filled up the box score again. He set career highs at the free-throw line, finishing 12-for-13, and added six rebounds, two steals and one block. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  It was the 450th consecutive regular-season sellout (20,147) at the American Airlines Center. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Rockets have lost four straight on the road. This was the first game of a four-game road trip. ... Dallas registered its seventh straight game with 13 or fewer turnovers (10). ... The Mavericks are 14-5 when reaching the century mark. ... Lin has made at least one steal in 19 straight games. ... Collison has converted 23 consecutive free throws, four short of his career best (March 2011). ... Dallas attempted a season-high 43 free throws. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Friday vs. Oklahoma City, Sunday @ Orlando, Friday vs. San Antonio. For the Rockets, Friday @ Indiana, Saturday @ Minnesota, Monday @ Charlotte.
