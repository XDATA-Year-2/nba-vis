  Warriors-Mavericks notebook   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Sunday March 20, 2011 11:11PM THE FACTS :  Dirk Nowitzki  scored 20 points,  Tyson Chandler  snared 17 boards and  Peja Stojakovic  stroked five 3-pointers to lead the Mavericks to their most lopsided victory of the season Sunday with a 101-73 rout of the Warriors in Dallas. The stingy Mavericks also set season-best marks for fewest points allowed in a game and in a quarter (10 in the fourth). Monta Ellis  had a team-high 18 points,  Stephen Curry  added 11 and  David Lee  posted his 32nd double-double (10 points, 12 rebounds) for Golden State, which lost its fourth straight overall and sixth straight against the Mavericks. QUOTABLE:  "We got hurt a little bit by a surprise player that came out of nowhere -- Peja."   -- Warriors head coach  Keith Smart  on Stojakovic, who had missed the Mavericks' previous six games due to neck stiffness. THE STAT:  Following a stretch of five losses in eight games, with all five coming against teams in the top eight in the Western Conference, Dallas got back on track by doing what it does very well: beating inferior opponents. The Mavericks (49-21) improved to 25-7 against teams with sub-.500 records with the win against the Warriors (30-40). TURNING POINT:  After trailing by as many as 17 in the first half, the Warriors were within 69-63 with 3:45 remaining in the third quarter before somebody pulled the plug on their offense. Golden State didn't score again in the period and managed just 10 points in the fourth quarter -- the fewest in any quarter this season by a Dallas opponent and the fewest in any period by the Warriors -- and finished the game on the wrong side of a 32-10 run. HOT:  Showing no rust after a two-week absence, Stojakovic sank three straight 3-pointers to start the second quarter to stretch Dallas' lead to 40-23. He was 5-for-8 from 3-point range and finished with 17 points. That snapped a recent dry spell for the 12-year veteran, who was a combined 3-for-19 from beyond the arc in his six previous games. NOT:  The Warriors finished 30 points below their season scoring average (103.1), their lowest output since a 79-72 loss at Milwaukee on Nov. 13. They shot 35.1 percent from the field and 25.0 percent (5-for-20) from 3-point range. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Golden State forward  Dorell Wright  came in averaging 22.0 points and shooting 50 percent (20-for-40) in his previous five games, but managed just six points on 2-for-8 shooting with five rebounds and four turnovers. ... Mavericks guard  Rodrigue Beaubois  was all over the court with 15 points, four rebounds, four assists, two steals and one block (plus five turnovers and five personal fouls). ROOKIE WATCH:  Former Baylor big man  Ekpe Udoh  made his sixth start of the season for Golden State and contributed eight points and three blocked shots, but corralled only one rebound in 29 minutes, 28 seconds of playing time. NOTABLE:  Mavericks forward  Shawn Marion  sat this one out after injuring his right wrist in Friday's loss to San Antonio. He is day-to-day. ... Reserve center  Brendan Haywood  did not play for the third time in four games for Dallas.  Ian Mahinmi  backed up Chandler and tallied a career high 13 rebounds and nine points. ... Nowitzki was 2-for-2 at the charity stripe to extend his streak to 58 consecutive free throws made, the longest streak in the NBA this season. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Thursday vs. Minnesota, Saturday @ Utah, Sunday @ Phoenix. For the Warriors, Monday @ San Antonio, Wednesday @ Houston, Friday vs. Toronto.
