  Spurs-Bulls notebook   By Kent McDill, for NBA.com Posted Thursday February 17, 2011 11:37PM THE FACTS:  Before tip-off Thursday,  Derrick Rose  said the Spurs-Bulls contest was a statement game. Then Rose went out and made the statement by himself, scoring a career-high 42 points to lead the Bulls to an impressive 109-99 win over the league's best team, the San Antonio Spurs. Rose scored 13 points in the fourth quarter. San Antonio guards  Tony Parker ,  Manu Ginobili  and  Gary Neal  tried to keep the Spurs in the game with 26 and 16 points, respectively. The Bulls earned their seventh straight home victory and their 15th win in their last 16 home games. The Spurs had the league's best road record of 21-7 going into the contest. QUOTABLE:  "We scored 99 points, shot 49 percent, hit seven 3-pointers, and you think you are going to win. But he negated that."    -- San Antonio coach  Gregg Popovich  on Bulls guard Derrick Rose THE STAT:  The Bulls shot 54 percent from the field, outrebounded the Spurs 41-29 and had 20 second-chance points. THE STAT II:  Perhaps unconsciously chasing his personal best, Rose scored the last 10 Bulls points of the game. TURNING POINT:  With the Bulls leading by seven points early in the fourth quarter, Bulls center  Omer Asik  missed a layup but teammate  Taj Gibson  gathered the rebound and dunked it for an 87-78 lead. The Bulls scored the next five points to build their biggest lead of the game, 92-78, with nine minutes left. INJURY UPDATE:  Bulls center  Joakim Noah  remains committed to a return to active duty next Wednesday in Toronto after missing 30 games due to a right thumb injury. The Bulls are 22-8 in those games. HOT:  Rose, who has had a streak of poor shooting performances recently, made 18 of 28 shots, setting a career best for shots made in a game. He was also 6-for-6 from the free-throw line, had a game high eight assists and had five rebounds. NOT:   Manu Ginobili  was 6-for-18 from the field for the Spurs. ROOKIE WATCH:  Neal was 6-for-9 from the field, including 4-for-5 from 3-point range for 16 points. QUOTABLE II:  "I was just trying to do whatever it takes to win and tonight I guess it was just scoring."    -- Bulls guard Derrick Rose GOOD MOVE:  Keeping  Keith Bogans  in the starting lineup is starting to pay offensive dividends for the Bulls. Bogans shot 2-for-3 from downtown Thursday and is now 12 for his last 23 from long range. NOTABLE:  The Bulls have a victory over every team in the Western Conference this season. UP NEXT:  For the Bulls, Wednesday @ Toronto, Feb. 24 vs. Miami, Feb. 26 @ Milwaukee. For the Spurs, Wednesday vs. Oklahoma City, Feb. 25 vs. New Jersey, Feb. 27 vs. Memphis.
