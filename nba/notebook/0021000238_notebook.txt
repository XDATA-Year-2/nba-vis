  Warriors-Wolves notebook   By Jim Beilby, for NBA.com Posted Saturday November 27, 2010 11:29PM THE FACTS:  The Golden State Warriors shot better than 50 percent from the floor and made 12-of-18 3-pointers in their 104-94 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves Saturday night.  Monta Ellis  had 26 points, 10 assists, seven steals, four rebounds and shot 50 percent from the floor. QUOTABLE:  "My hat is off to [Monta Ellis], because we ask him to lead our team in scoring, be aggressive, be a team leader, and also guard the other team's best player. He's been able to do that."   -- Golden State coach  Keith Smart   THE STAT:  Golden State came into the game second in the league in steals (behind Memphis). In this game they forced 21 Minnesota turnovers and recorded 16 steals (compared to four for Minnesota). Ellis had seven of his team's 16 steals while  David Lee  and  Stephen Curry  had three each. TURNING POINT:  The third quarter. After trailing 51-48 at the half, Golden State dominated the third quarter, outscoring the Wolves 36-17 on nearly 60 percent shooting. Minnesota made a run in the fourth quarter but never got closer than eight points. HOT:   Dorell Wright  scored a career high 30 points and was 9-for-12 from beyond the arc, including a perfect 5-for-5 in the decisive third quarter. His nine made 3-pointers set a franchise record. NOT:  Minnesota tallied 21 turnovers which led to 32 points for the Warriors. Every Wolves player had at least one turnover except  Kevin Love . NOTABLE:  Love recorded his fourth 20 point-20 rebound game (21 points, 22 rebounds) this month. The last player to record four 20-20 games in a month was  Kevin Willis  in Nov 1991. UP NEXT:  For the Timberwolves, Wednesday @ Dallas, Friday @ San Antonio, Saturday vs. Cleveland. For the Warriors, Tuesday vs. San Antonio, Thursday vs. Phoenix, Sunday @ Oklahoma City.
