  Grizzlies-Mavericks notebook   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Sunday March 6, 2011 11:01PM THE FACTS:   Zach Randolph  knocked down a 17-foot rainbow over  Brendan Haywood  with 0.3 seconds left to give Memphis a 104-103 victory Sunday in Dallas, snapping the Mavericks' eight-game winning streak and capping a wild finish. The Grizzlies trailed by 17 at the half, but pulled ahead with 14.3 seconds left when  Shane Battier  made a reverse layup after catching a blocked shot under the basket.  Dirk Nowitzki  then grabbed the lead right back with a jumper over Battier from the foul line with 3.1 seconds to play, only to see Randolph answer his heroics. Randolph was 10-for-13 from the field and finished with 27 points, nine rebounds and four steals. The Grizzlies outscored Dallas 66-38 in the paint and also got double-doubles from  Marc Gasol  (16 points, 10 rebounds),  Mike Conley  (17 points, 10 assists) and Battier (11 points, 11 rebounds).  Jason Terry  topped the Mavericks with 26 points, Nowitzki scored 23 and  Shawn Marion  added 10 points and 12 boards. The loss also ended a nine-game home winning streak for Dallas. QUOTABLE:  "Zach came off the screen and nobody came with him. He had the ball when Haywood finally came over to him. I think Haywood thought he was going to drive. Thank God he thought that. I hoped he thought that. He allowed Zach to get off his shot and when it went up in the air, I thought it was good."  --  Memphis head coach  Lionel Hollins  on Randolph's game-winning jump shot. THE STAT:  The Mavericks were 10-for-21 from 3-point range and has now made at least one 3-pointer in 1,000 consecutive games, dating back to Feb. 27, 1999. It's the longest streak in NBA history. They have made at least six treys in 32 straight games, the longest active streak in the league. TURNING POINT:  Memphis seized momentum with a 41-point third quarter, the most points scored in any quarter against the Mavericks this season. The Grizzlies shot a sizzling 72 percent (18-for-25) from the field and turned a 17-point halftime deficit into a 79-78 lead entering the fourth quarter. Conley and Randolph each scored 12 in the period. QUOTABLE II:  "They stepped up their defensive intensity in the third quarter and they were more physical than us in the second half. They just outplayed us in the third quarter."  --  Mavericks guard  J.J. Barea. HOT:   Rodrigue Beaubois  scored 10 of the Mavericks' first 13 points in the game and finished a perfect first quarter with 12 points. He shot 4-for-4 from the field (2-for-2 3-pointers) and was 2-for-2 at the line in the period. Beaubois ended the night with a season-high 15 points. NOT:  Memphis shot 34.9 percent (15-for-43) in the first half, including 1-for-7 from beyond the arc. Conley,  Jason Williams  and  Ish Smith  were a combined 0-for-11 before intermission. GOOD MOVE:  With his first steal of the game, at the 9:55 mark of the first quarter,  Jason Kidd  moved into sole possession of third place in NBA history. He entered the game tied with Gary Payton (2,445) and now trails only John Stockton (3,265) and Michael Jordan (2,514) with 2,447. BAD MOVE:  An ill-advised layup attempt by Smith, the Grizzlies' rookie, with 43 seconds remaining in the first half was swatted into the second row of seats by Haywood. Haywood finished with a season-high six blocked shots...Backup center  Ian Mahinmi  fouled out with 9:46 left in the third quarter, leaving Dallas even thinner in the post. The Mavs were already without starter Tyson Chandler (sprained right ankle). NOTABLE:  After going scoreless in his Dallas debut Friday against Indiana,  Corey Brewer  scored his first points as a Maverick with a fastbreak layup at the 5:27 mark of the second quarter... Memphis won the regular-season series, 3-1. It's the first time the Grizzlies have taken a series from the Mavericks since entering the league in Vancouver in 1995-96. ... Forward  Leon Powe , acquired on Saturday, was active for the Grizzlies but did not play. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Monday @ Minnesota, Wednesday @ New Orleans, Thursday vs. New York. For the Grizzlies, Monday vs. Oklahoma City, Wednesday vs. New York, Saturday @ Miami.
