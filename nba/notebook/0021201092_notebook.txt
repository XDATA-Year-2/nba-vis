 THE FACTS : The Indiana Pacers edged into the No. 2 spot in the Eastern Conference Saturday night by knocking off the Phoenix Suns 112-104. 
 The visiting Pacers (47-27) didn't put the Suns (23-51) away until the closing minutes. The Pacers led just 102-101 with 3:10 left after a three-point play by the Suns'  Jermaine O'Neal . But in their next six possessions, the Suns missed five shots and had one turnover. Only then could the Pacers coast.  
 The Pacers are now a half-game ahead of idle New York for the No. 2 seed in the East. They're also 3-0 on their current road trip. The loss was the Suns' sixth straight, and they have the NBA's fourth-worst record.  
 
 Paul George  scored 25 to lead the Pacers.  Roy Hibbert  added 20 points and seven boards. 
 The Suns gave themselves a better chance than in their last two games when they allowed  Goran Dragic  to play. They had Dragic rest the previous two games, both lopsided Suns' losses. Dragic hit a 3-pointer to draw the Suns within 88-85 with 9:57 left, then -- after the Pacers had seemed to put it away with a 7-0 run to make it 95-85 -- Dragic led another comeback. His 3-pointer made it 97-94 Pacers with 5:07 left. Moments later, a whirling drive by Dragic pulled the Suns within 99-98. But they could get no closer.  
 Dragic led the Suns with 21 points and nine assists.  Markief Morris  added 18 points. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "We've got the DNA, the whole make-up to make a great run. We're big inside. We [have] got guys who can create and make shots. Our defense is amazing." 
 -- Paul George on the Pacers' playoff prospects 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "There are no moral victories, but when you are traveling down the road we are traveling you have to get small victories out of tough times. I think tonight we got a lot of small victories. That is a champhionship-caliber team over there. We fought them toe to toe right up until the end."  
 --Suns coach  Lindsey Hunter 
 
 
 THE STAT : The Pacers used their size advantage to draw fouls and shoot 46 free throws to just 19 for the Suns. 
 
 TURNING POINT : When the Pacers put the clamps down in the final 3:00.  
 
 QUOTABLE III : "We finished the game strong. We're a team that's filled with leaders."  
 -- Roy Hibbert 
 
 HOT : The Suns shot 18-for-19 from the line to help them stay in the game. 
 
 NOT : The Pacers shot just 4-for-15 on 3-pointers to help keep the game close. 
 
 QUOTABLE IV : "It wasn't perfect. ...not our best defensive performance. But at crunch time, we got enough stops to get the 'W'." 
 --Pacers coach  Frank Vogel  (the Suns shot 49 percent against them) 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT : With  Danny Granger  out for the season, George is -- more than ever -- the Pacers' main man. For the season, he is the only NBA player averaging at least 17.5 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 1.75 steals. He is a leading candidate for most improved player. "Paul George is a phenomenal talent, a budding superstar," Hunter said. 
 
 NOTABLE : This could have been the first NBA game ever where two sets of brothers played against each other: Markieff and  Marcus Morris  for the Suns and  Tyler  and  Ben Hansbrough  for the Pacers. But Ben didn't get in the game. ...The Suns are 2-11 without injured starting center  Marcin Gortat.  
 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Pacers, Monday @ LA Clippers, Friday vs. Thunder, Saturday @ Washington. For the Suns, Wednesday @ LA Clippers, Friday vs. Warriors, Sunday vs. Hornets.
