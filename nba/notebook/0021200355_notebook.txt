 THE FACTS: Shannon Brown  scored 14 of his 22 points in the third quarter, matching Sacramento's point total for the period, and the Phoenix Suns rallied from a 19-point deficit to beat the Kings 101-90 for their season-best third straight win. 
 
 Jared Dudley  had 20 and  Luis Scola  and  Marcin Gortat  each scored 14 for the Suns, who have trailed by double digits in six of their 10 victories. Gortat added 13 rebounds and six blocked shots while Scola recorded a career-best 10 assists. 
 
 Jimmer Fredette  scored a career-high 22 off the bench and  Aaron Brooks  scored 12 for the Kings, who have lost five straight overall and four in a row against the Suns. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I look on the right side (of the record) and we've got 15 losses. We can't overlook anyone. Anyone in this state. Anyone. Not even (Scottsdale) Chaparral High School."  
 -- Suns coach  Alvin Gentry 
 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Kings missed seven of their first 10 shots and nine minutes into the game had as many turnovers as field goals. After scoring 32 points in the second, Sacramento went 7-for-22 from the floor in the third with another five turnovers. 
 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Brown gave the Suns their first lead since late in the first quarter, 59-58, scoring seven points in 62 seconds to key a 26-6 run over the second and third quarters. 
 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "You work so hard in the first half to establish a lead and they you let it go in three minutes. It's kind of disheartening."  
- Brooks 
 
 
 HOT:  Brown was 10-for-13 for the game and 6-for-7 in the third quarter, including a pair of 3-pointers. As a team, the Suns were 13-for-21 for the period and had 10 assists on 13 baskets. 
 
 
 NOT:  Only three Sacramento players scored in double digits and the Kings' starters combined for just 41 points. ... Kings center  DeMarcus Cousins  spent much of the game in foul trouble and finished with nine points on 1-for-10 shooting from the field and 7-for-8 from the line. 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Sacramento has won in Phoenix just once since Nov. 6, 2005. ... Phoenix went 6:31 across the first and second quarters without a field goal. ... The Suns are 6-2 against the Western Conference. ... The Suns have followed their seven-game losing streak with a three-game winning streak, the first time that's happened in club history since 1987-88 when Phoenix dropped nine straight and then won four in a row. ... Scola is the fifth non-guard with double-digit assists in a game this season, joining  Kevin Durant, Al Horford, Greg Monroe  and  Nicolas Batum . 
 
 
 IN THE ARENA:  Hall of Famer  Bill Russell  was seated just to the right of the Suns bench. 
 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Kings, Wednesday vs. Golden State, Friday @ L.A. Clippers, Sunday vs. Portland. For the Suns, Wednesday vs. Charlotte, Saturday @ Portland, Sunday vs. L.A. Clippers.
