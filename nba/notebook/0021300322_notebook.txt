 THE FACT:  Minnesota overcame a 19-point first-quarter deficit.  It was the largest deficit since they came back from 21 down to defeat New York on November 12, 2010 -- also known as the night of  Kevin Love 's 31 and 31. 
 
 THE LEAD:  The Minnesota Timberwolves overcame a slow start and poor shooting with timely defense and big rebounds as they defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 106-99, on Wednesday night.    Love had 26 points, 15 rebounds, and five assists.  There have been five 25 point ,15 rebound, five-assist games in the league this season, all by Love.  And Love owns seven of the league's 17 25 point,15 rebound games.   Nikola Pekovic  added 20 points and 10 rebounds and  Ricky Rubio  had 21 points, seven assists, and five rebounds 
 Philadelphia's quick start included a 16-0 run.  Nine of James Anderson's 16 points came in that run.  And  Spencer Hawes  and  Tony Wroten  each scored 20 for the Sixers in the losing cause.   Evan Turner  had a off night, scoring only 13 points and coughing up the ball a season high nine times. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I told them that you shouldn't have to say anything after the way we started the game.  You have to learn a lesson that when you get a nice win last night it means nothing tonight.  You'd better understand that if you want to build anything, get a streak going. Night after night you have to come out and play.  We are lucky.  We are lucky that they got 39 points, that they went up 19 in the first quarter ...Usually it's hard to have that happen and win the game.  We got the win, but hopefully we learned a lesson." 
 -- Minnesota coach  Rick Adelman 
 
 
 THE STAT:   Minnesota shot 38.5 percent from the floor, over 14 percent worse than the Sixers, who shot 52.7 percent.  But Minnesota ended up with 22 more field goal attempts than Philadelphia, due in large part to their 17-5 advantage in offensive rebounds.  The fact that Philadelphia committed 26 turnovers helped as well. 
 
 TURNING POINT:   After trailing for the entire game, it was Minnesota's much maligned bench (and maligned for a reason) that provided the spark.  They went on a 8-0 run in the early minutes of the fourth quarter and gave Minnesota their first lead of the game with 8:27 to play when  Robbie Hummel  hit a 3-pointer from the left corner.  The starters came in and iced the game with the third of Rubio's three steals coming at an opportune time with 1:12 to play and the Sixers trying to make it a one possession game. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "In the big picture, we put ourselves in position to win a game.  We put ourselves in position to win a game on the road and that's already hard to do.  I give Minnesota credit, but it's a disappointment.  I think the energy and the effort our guys give, I'm proud of.  I continue to be proud of what I see on the floor.  I think that those free throw numbers and the turnovers are the difference. They have 20-something more shots and 17 offensive rebounds.  If you close your eyes, well, that's a 30 point loss.  They just had stats that were too insurmountable." 
 -- Philadelphia head coach  Brett Brown 
 
 
 HOT:  Philadelphia outscored Minnesota 39-20 in the first quarter. They shot 77.3 percent from the field in the opening frame.  This is a surprising statistic because Philadelphia is ranked last in the league in first quarter point differential (-119). 
 
 NOT:  Minnesota shot 30.8 percent from the field in the first quarter.  Their 19-point deficit after the first quarter was surprising because they came into the league ranked first in first quarter point differential (+110). 
 
 NOT:   Kevin Martin  was 0-for-7 in the first half and finished with five points on 1-for-9 shooting. 
 
 NOTABLE:   The 76ers have now dropped 12 of their last 14 games and nine in a row on the road. ... Minnesota has now won 11 of their last 13 games against the 76ers in Minnesota. ... Not including tonight, Love has averaged only 13.4 points in his seven career games against Philadelphia, his lowest average against any opponent. ... Turner and Love are two of just five players (the others being  Kevin Durant ,  Blake Griffin , and  LeBron ) averaging at least 20 points, six rebounds, and three assists per game. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For Minnesota, Friday at San Antonio, Sunday at Memphis, Monday at Boston.  For Philadelphia, Friday at Toronto, Saturday vs. Portland, Monday at Brooklyn.
