  Notebook: Rockets 114, Wizards 106   By Rich Dubroff, for NBA.com  Posted Monday January 16, 2012 7:18PM THE FACTS:   Kevin Martin  had 25 points,  Samuel Dalembert  added 20,  Luis Scola  chipped in with 18 and  Kyle Lowry  had 16 to lead the Houston Rockets to their third straight win, 114-106 over the Washington Wizards. John Wall  had a career-high 38 points for the Wizards, who have lost 12 of their 13 games this season. Houston broke a 58-all tie early in the third quarter with a 25-6 run that gave them a 83-64 lead with 3:16 remaining. Washington cut the lead to five in the fourth quarter, but the Rockets hung on. QUOTABLE:  "Apparently if you get a fast break and throw it off the backboard in the third quarter, and you're 1-11, you're not supposed to do stuff like that."   - Wizards center  JaVale McGee , who annoyed coach  Flip Saunders  with a showboat dunk early in the third quarter in the midst of Houston's run. THE STAT:  Wall had 18 points in the fourth quarter, but it wasn't enough to steal a win for Washington. TURNING POINT:  After McGee's dunk, which cut Houston's lead to 64-60, the Rockets outscored the Wizards 19-4. QUOTABLE II:  "That's unacceptable. Maybe I'm too old school. Save that for the All-Star Game."   --Saunders on McGee's dunk. HOT:  Wall, who entered the game shooting 34.8 percent, was 13-for-22. He was 12-for-16 from the line and had eight assists, six rebounds and a season-high four steals. "Once it got easy for us, our defense went to pot again," Houston coach  Kevin McHale  said. "We play defense in spurts, and we sometimes don't play defense in long enough spurts." NOT:   Nick Young . Before the game, Young was the only Wizards' guard with a shooting percentage above 40 percent-40.1 percent. He was just 3-for-12. GOOD MOVE:  Saunders sat McGee in the last nine minutes when Washington made a futile run. BAD MOVE:  McGee's dunk, which will lead all the highlight shows, but irked his embattled coach. "We have some players that look for highlights instead of substance," Saunders complained. NOTABLE:  Houston hit its first 20 free throws. They made 25 of 26. Martin made all 10 of his. NEXT:  Rockets: Tuesday vs. Pistons, Thursday vs. Hornets, Saturday vs. Spurs. Wizards: Wednesday vs. Thunder, Friday vs. Nuggets, Sunday vs. Celtics
