 THE FACT:  Chris Paul  became the second player in the last 40 seasons with 38 points, 12 assists and a shooting percentage of 78.6 from the field (11-for-14 FG). The other was  Clyde Drexler  (Nov. 13, 1990) 
 THE LEAD: Paul led five starters in double-figure scoring, including  Blake Griffin  and  Jared Dudley  with 16 points each as the Los Angeles Clippers held a double digit lead the entire second half en route to a 113-97 win over the Washington Wizards Saturday night. 
 Paul's excellent night included 5-for-7 on 3-pointers, and went 11-for-11 from the free-throw line for the Clippers (16-9). He took control immediately with 18 points and nine assists in the first half. After Washington (9-13) trimmed a 21-point deficit to 12 with eight minutes remaining, Paul responded. He immediately produced three field goals including a 3-pointer and an assist on Griffin's dunk, pushing the lead back to 104-86. 
 
 John Wall  led the Wizards with 24 points and 12 assists, but also had six turnovers. Washington has lost four straight, including twice in overtime, since reaching .500 on December 2. Kevin Seraphin scored a season-high 16 points. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We wanted to try to this from an okay trip to a good trip. We just wanted to win the game...There are a lot of factors. Long flight back home and we've got a lot of sore losers on this team. We just wanted to come out and play the right way."  
 
 -- Chris Paul, who deemed this matchup a "must win" before the Clippers faced Washington 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Feeding off Paul's passing ways, the Clippers had 17 assists on 21 first-half baskets. 
 
 TURNING POINT : Los Angeles led 34-28 after the first quarter, then zoomed away in the second. Paul scored or assisted on 12 of Los Angeles' final 14 points as the Clippers entered halftime leading 59-46 at halftime. Los Angeles had 17 assists on 21 first half baskets. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "This was the first game where we truly had no chance to win. They were just way better."  
 
 -- Wizards center  Marcin Gortat , who had six points and seven rebounds 
 
 
 HOT:  Dudley made 7-for-10 shots including 2-for-4 from beyond the arc. 
 
 NOT:  The Wizards finished 3-for-14 on 3-point attempts with Wall missing all four of his shots from beyond the arc. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Clippers coach  Doc Rivers  game sixth-man extraordinaire  Jamal Crawford  his first start since April 9, 2012. The idea provided Paul with another scoring weapon and used  Willie Green  as a calming influence off the bench. Crawford finished with 17.  
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Wizards fell to 0-6 this season playing without  Nene  (right foot tendinitis), who missed his third straight game. Washington has lost eight straight dating back to last season without the Brazilian big man. 
 
 NOTABLE: DeAndre Jordan  has 15 points and 10 rebounds for the Clippers. ... Martell Webster  and  Trevor Booker  each had 12 for the Wizards while  Trevor Ariza  scored 11. ...The Clippers shot 26-for-31 from the free-throw line. ...Paul rented out two suites at the Verizon Center and played before 50 family members. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Clippers, Monday vs. Spurs, Wednesday @ Pelicans, Saturday vs. Nuggets.  For the Wizards: Monday @ Knicks, Wednesday @ Nets, Saturday @ Celtics.
