  Suns-Knicks notebook   By Adam Zagoria, for NBA.com Posted Monday January 17, 2011 4:25PM THE FACTS:  Despite a season-high 41 points from  Amar'e Stoudemire , the Phoenix Suns handed the Knicks their third straight loss, 129-121, at Madison Square Garden. Phoenix has won three in a row and four of five since the Knicks beat them by 25 points Jan. 7 in Phoenix. QUOTABLE:  "I know that thing about defense wins championships, but I still haven't seen a team win a game 0-0. So you gotta be able to make shots and put it in the basket."    -- Suns coach  Alvin Gentry , whose team shot 52 percent from beyond the arc THE STAT:   Grant Hill  (38),  Steve Nash  (36) and  Vince Carter  (32) are a combined 106 years old, yet scored 69 points and went 9-for-14 from beyond the arc. As a team, the Suns were 11 of 21 from deep. TURNING POINT:  With the game tied at 106, Phoenix took charge with a 10-2 run, getting 3-pointers from Nash and a wide-open Carter to seize a 116-108 lead.  Raymond Felton  literally watched Carter unload the 3-pointer over his head. QUOTABLE II:  "We know that four games over .500 is unacceptable. We had a chance to take advantage of our situation and we didn't...Now we've got a tough road trip ahead [to Texas and Oklahoma City]."    -- Amar'e Stoudemire HOT:  Carter tallied a season-high 29 points on 11 of 20 shooting, hitting 5 of 8 from beyond the arc. His 3-pointer from the right corner put the Suns up 114-108. NOT:   Anthony Randolph  continues to remain out of the rotation for the Knicks and president  Donnie Walsh  recently met with Randolph's agent, Bill Duffy, to discuss a possible trade for a draft pick. ROOKIE WATCH:   Landry Fields  had 11 points on 4 of 7 shooting and nine rebounds for the Knicks. INSIDE THE ARENA:  New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Mike D of the Beastie Boys, Ethan Hawke, Terrell Owens and Larry Fitzgerald were in the house. NOTABLE:  Stoudemire bumped  Channing Frye  in the first quarter and got his 12th technical foul of the season, tying him with  Dwight Howard  for most in the NBA. He is four away from an automatic one-game suspension and will receive a warning letter from the league with his $4,000 fine. UP NEXT:  For the Knicks, Wednesday @ Houston, Friday @ San Antonio, Saturday @ Oklahoma City. For the Suns, Wednesday @ Cleveland, Friday @ Washington, Saturday @Detroit.
