  Suns-Thunder notebook   By Randy Renner, NBA.com  Posted Sunday December 19, 2010 10:40PM THE FACTS:  Veteran forward  Grant Hill  led a short-handed Phoenix Suns team to a thrilling 113-110 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder. Hill scored a season-high 30 points as he played extended minutes for a team that traded away its leading scorer and two other players. It was Hill's first 30 point game since 2000.  Kevin Durant  led Oklahoma City with 28 points, 10 of those coming in the fourth quarter. The Suns had led by as many as 13 points but the Thunder rallied with 40 points in the third quarter to take the lead but Oklahoma City couldn't hold off Phoenix down the stretch.  Steve Nash  added 20 points and 11 assists for the Suns.  Jeff Green, Russell Westbrook  and  Nick Collison  all had 19 for the Thunder. QUOTABLE:  "Considering our circumstances tonight (being short-handed) we were really good tonight. Our defense was great we shot the ball well, I thought it was a really good win."    --Suns coach  Alvin Gentry THE STAT:  Both teams shot more than 58% in the fourth quarter (Phoenix 58.8%, OKC 58.3%) but the Suns took five more shots than the Thunder and hit three more (Suns 10-for-17, Thunder 7-for-12). In a three point game that was the difference. TURNING POINT:  With the game tied at 94 with 6:58 to play Phoenix went on a 12-6 run over the next four and a half minutes to lead 106-100 with 2:34 to go. Oklahoma City got no closer than the final margin of three. QUOTABLE II:  "If anybody should be on the All-Star team it should be him, (Grant Hill) the way he's playing somebody has to consider him when they talk about the All-Star team.    --Gentry on Grant Hill's 30-point night HOT:  In the first half Phoenix shot 22-for-40 (55%) Center  Robin Lopez  was 6-for-6. NOT:  Also in the first half OKC shot 12-for-43 (27.9%) and just 1-for-11 (9.1%) on 3-pointers. Kevin Durant was 2-for-11 and 0-for-4 on 3-pointers. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Grant Hill finished with 30 points on 9-for-17 shooting. He was 12-for-14 at the free throw line and pulled down 11 rebounds. He also handed out two assists and blocked a shot. INSIDE THE ARENA : For the second time in a week an Oklahoma City Thunder fan hit a half-court shot for big money. Last Sunday night 31-year-old  Robert Yanders  did it, tonight it was  Todd Lafferty  who took a running start and then used a two-handed heave to bank the shot home for 20-thousand dollars. GOOD MOVE:  Suns coach Alvin Gentry decided to play a zone defense most of the night against the Thunder. It worked great in the first half as OKC hit only 27.9% and just 9.1% from long range trying to shoot over that zone. BAD MOVE:  Staying with the zone in the second half. Oklahoma City solved its shooting problems hitting 61.8% in the last 24 minutes and 50% (5-for-10) on 3-pointers. ROOKIE WATCH : Suns forward  Gani Lawal  and center  Garrett Siler  did not play. Thunder center  Cole Aldrich  also did not take the floor. NOTABLE : The Thunder lost a close game, seven points or less, for just the second time in 14 tries. Their only other close loss of the season came at Houston. UP NEXT:  For the Suns, Monday @ San Antonio, Thursday vs Heat, Sunday @ LA Clippers. For the Thunder, Tuesday @ Charlotte, Wednesday @ New York, Saturday vs Nuggets.
