 THE LEAD : The Washington Wizards held  Kevin Garnett  and  Paul Pierce  to just eight points in Washington's 112-108 win over the Brooklyn Nets. 
 
 THE FACTS :  Bradley Beal  tied a career high with 29 points,  Nene  had 20 and  John Wall  had 17 points and 14 assists to lead the Wizards to their 112-108 overtime win over Brooklyn. 
 Washington, which has won two after losing its first three, trailed by 11 with 4:46 to play, then Nene scored 12 points as the Wizards tied the game at 99 in regulation. 
 In overtime,  Trevor Ariza  hit a key 3-pointer with 46.3 seconds to play to give Washington the lead. The Nets were led by  Brook Lopez , who had 18 of his 23 points in the first half. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "This is a process. Obviously, you have to have some type of patience with that process, but losing is losing. It sucks." -- Garnett on Brooklyn's third straight road loss. 
 
 THE STAT : Garnett finally scored with 3:40 to play in the fourth, and Pierce didn't score until 2:50 was left in overtime. Garnett hadn't been held scoreless since Jan. 27, 1996 and Pierce since Mar. 9, 1999. 
 
 TURNING POINT : Nene turned the game around with 12 of the Wizards' 18 points in their 18-7 end to regulation. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "They both ended up scoring four, so you don't have to worry about writing that story." -- Washington coach  Randy Wittman  on being told his team nearly held Garnett and Pierce scoreless. 
 
 HOT : Nene was 8-for-12 and hit all four of his field-goal attempts late in the fourth quarter.  
 
 NOT :  Garnett and Pierce combined to shoot 3-for-16. 
 
 GOOD MOVE : Wittman sticking with Ariza, who was 1-for-7 in the first four quarters.  
 
 BAD MOVE :  Pierce was called for traveling just before Ariza's 3-point shot. 
 
 NOTABLE :  The Nets lost their third straight road game.  
 
 IN THE ARENA : Even though he's played here four times since leaving the Wizards in June 2012,   Andray Blatche  was still booed every time he touched the ball. 
 
 NEXT :  Nets: Saturday vs. Pacers, Wednesday @Kings, Nov. 15 @ Suns; Wizards: Sunday @ Thunder, Tuesday @ Mavericks, Wednesday @ Spurs
