 THE FACT:   Kyle Korver  set an NBA record by making at least one 3-pointer in his 90th consecutive game when he connected with 5:29 left in the first quarter.  
 
 THE LEAD:  Korver was part of a trend for the Hawks, who hit five treys in the first quarter en route to the Hawks' 108-89 win over the visiting Cavaliers. He had two,  Lou Williams  and  Cartier Martin  connected off the bench and forward  Paul Millsap  hit a 50-footer at the buzzer for a 37-20 lead. 
 The Cavs continued a trend themselves in falling to an NBA-worst 1-10 on the road. 
 Atlanta (11-10) led by as many as 24 points in the second quarter and 29 in the third period.  Dion Waiters  scored a season-high 30 points off the bench for the Cavs, who got 20 points and a season-high 13 rebounds from center  Andrew Bynum  and 13 points off the bench from  Jarrett Jack . 
 Two Cleveland starters went scoreless, however, as  Kyrie Irving  (0-for-9) and  Alonzo Gee  (0-for-2) missed all 11 of their combined shots. 
 Atlanta spread the ball around, and registered 31 assists on 47 made shots. Seven players scored in double figures, led by center  Al Horford  (22 points) and Millsap (16 points, 14 rebounds).  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It feels good. I'm glad it's done . . . I'm the product of good team basketball, of setting screens, and [getting] good passes, spacing the floor and all of that . . . It's never been about the streak. It's about making the shots you get. I don't want to be a high-volume shooter. I try to be efficient." 
 -- Korver 
 
 
 THE STAT:   46.8 percent -- Korver has shot 235-of-502 (46.8 percent) on his 3-pointers during the streak. 
 
 TURNING POINT:   After Bynum dunked with 8:08 left in the first quarter to pull Cleveland within 8-6, the Hawks went on a 16-5 run with three 3-pointers made in that stretch. Korver hit two and Williams   one. Atlanta led by double digits for all but 16 seconds of the game's final 40:31. 
 After those four, you can choose any (or none) of these, as the game requires, and put them in any order: 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I'm in awe to see something like that. Teams focus on keeping [Korver] off the 3-point line, and for him to do that for so long is an amazing accomplishment." 
 -- Hawks forward  Paul Millsap , who made the pass to Korver for his record-breaking shot. 
 
 
 HOT:   Millsap scored 12 points in the first quarter on 5-for-8 shooting. His 50-foot 3-pointer at the buzzer was his 15th of the season (15-for-37). He has made at least one 3-pointer in six consecutive games. . . . Waiters scored 13 points in the second quarter on 6-for-7 shooting and added a free throw. . . . Bynum had 12 points and nine rebounds in the first half in what likely was his best game of the season.  
 
 NOT:   Three Cleveland starters combined to miss all 15 of their  shots in the first half as the Hawks built a 63-43 lead. Irving was 0-for-8,  C.J. Miles  was 0-for-5 and Gee missed both his tries. They finished the game 1-for-19. . . . Two Cleveland subs were also scoreless ( Anthony Bennett  was 0-for-3, and  Sergey Karasev  did not take a shot in 2:51). 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "The shots just weren't falling . . . I'm not shooting the best this year, but I'm getting the shots I want . . . sometimes I'm out there thinking too much." 
 -- Irving 
 
 
 QUOTABLE IV:  "We've got to come out with a sense of urgency," he said. "It's frustrating to have to keep talking about the same thing over and over. Superman's not coming in the locker room to help us. It's just us." 
 --  Waiters 
 
 
 NOTABLE:   Atlanta starters more than doubled Cleveland starters in points scored, 71-32. . . . The Hawks have scored more than 100 points in four straight games. . . . Williams' 13 points off the bench were a season high. . . . Hawks reserve big man  Gustavo Ayon  suffered a left ankle sprain and a left leg contusion in the final minute of the game. His status is to be determined.  
 
 UP NEXT:   For the Cavs, Saturday vs. L.A. Clippers, Tuesday vs. New York, Friday @ Orlando. For Atlanta, Tuesday vs. Oklahoma City, Friday vs. Washington, Saturday at New York.
