  THE FACTS: Greg Monroe  scored 19 points and swept 18 rebounds while rookie  Kyle Singler  scored 16 points in the Detroit Pistons' 94-76 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers Wednesday night at the Wells Fargo Center.  Tayshaun Prince  and  Brandon Knight  added 15 points apiece for the Pistons, who snapped a maddening eight-game losing streak to open the season. The Pistons were sharp from the opening tip and never let the Sixers make a run in the second half. 
 
 Lavoy Allen  led the Sixers (4-4) with 14 points and  Jrue Holiday  scored 12 points. No other player reached double figures for Philadelphia, which dropped its third game in a row at home. 
 
 QUOTABLE:   "It was definitely not the start we wanted. I'm just happy to get a win." 
 
 --  Brandon Knight 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Sixers shot 29.8 percent. That's the lowest field -goal percentage by the Sixers or their opponent in the building's history dating to its opening in 1996. Philadelphia's previous low was 30.1 percent against Detroit on Feb. 23, 2004. 
 
 TURNING POINT : Detroit led 69-54 after the third quarter and quickly ripped off five straight points -- a jumper by  Corey Maggette  on its first possession followed by a three-point play by Singler. Just like that, the Pistons extended their lead to 20. 
 
 HOT:  Prince was 7-for-13 and Singler was 7-for-14. Both players knocked down some extremely difficult shots throughout the game. 
 
 NOT:  Virtually the entire Sixers team. Holiday was 4-for-13,  Jason Richardson  was 3-for-12 and  Thaddeus Young  was 2-for-11.  Nick Young  missed seven of his nine shots while  Dorell Wright  and  Spencer Hawes  were each 1-for-5. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:   "I have no answers why we were so flat. I have no idea." 
 
 -- Sixers coach  Doug Collins 
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Monroe had 19 points, 18 rebounds, six assists and one blocked shot in nearly 40 minutes. In addition, Prince contributed 15 points, six assists, five rebounds and one steal. Knight had 15 points, seven assists and seven rebounds. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  There wasn't much buzz inside the arena with an announced crowd of 11,879. When the Sixers fell behind by as many as 23 points, it was eerily quiet. Not much to cheer about from the home side. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:   "It's frustrating. I think that was pretty apparent." 
 
 
 -- Spencer Hawes 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Pistons started aggressively and maintained that level of intensity the entire night. They never got away from attacking the rim and hardly looked like a winless team. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  When the Sixers couldn't get anything going offensively, Collins could have gone deeper into his bench just to search for a brief spark. That spark never came. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Singler started for the Pistons and was very impressive with 16 points and four rebounds. Center  Andre Drummond  contributed six points and two rebounds, while forward  Khris Middleto n was scoreless in a brief 1:19 stint late in the game. For the Sixers, forward  Arnett Moultrie  had two points and two rebounds while guard  Maalik Wayns  added two points and one assist. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Pistons played without starting guard  Rodney Stuckey  because of flu-like symptoms. ... Drummond picked up a technical foul with 4:18 remaining in the third quarter. ... Dating to last season, the Sixers have lost seven of eight at home. ... Detroit's 0-8 start before this win was its worst start in franchise history. ... The Sixers scored a season-low 76 points and are averaging 88 points in eight games. They were second in the league in the preseason, averaging 102.7 points. ... Philadelphia committed only four turnovers. ... Monroe became the first Detroit player to have at least 19 points, 18 rebounds and six assists since  Grant Hill  accomplished the feat with 35 points, 18 rebounds and six assists at Dallas on April 1, 1997. ... Monroe has five double-doubles this season. ... The Sixers were outrebounded 57-38 by Detroit, two nights after being outboarded by the Bucks, 48-31. 
 
 NEXT:  For the Pistons, Friday vs. Orlando, Sunday vs. Boston, Wednesday @ Orlando. For the Sixers, Friday vs. Utah, Sunday vs. Cleveland, Tuesday vs. Toronto.
