 THE FACT:   Since the beginning of last season, the Thunder are now 40-1 when holding an opponent to 42 percent or less shooting. 
 
 THE LEAD:  The Oklahoma City Thunder never trailed, led by as many as 15, and cruised past the Los Angeles Clippers 105-91 behind a 28-point effort from  Kevin Durant . 
 Durant also added eight assists and six rebounds. The Thunder had three other players score in double figures.  Serge Ibaka  had 17 points, five rebounds and three blocks.  Russell Westbrook  added 12 points, six rebounds and five assists but was just 5-for-13 shooting and missed all six of his 3-point attempts.  Reggie Jackson  finished with 11 points and six boards. 
 
 Blake Griffin ,  Chris Paul  and  Jamal Crawford  all had big nights for Los Angeles. Griffin scored 27 points and grabbed 10 rebounds, the 11th time in the last 12 games this season he's had a 20 & 10 game. Paul had 17 points and 12 assists adding to his NBA record of double-double games with points and assists to start a season (13). Crawford finished with 18 points off the bench. 
 The Clippers, who shot 41.3 from the field, came in averaging 108.7 points a game (2nd in the NBA) their 91 points tonight were the second fewest they've scored this season and they are now 0-3 when scoring less than 100 points. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "That was about as we as we can execute a game plan. I thought we really did a great job in the second half, especially chasing them off the 3-point line. We really locked in our plan to hold down their transition points and not to let them hurt us from three." 
 -- Thunder head coach  Scott Brooks 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Thunder held the Clippers to just 28.6 percent (8-for-28) on 3-point shots and LA had just 12 fast break points on 5-for-11 shooting. 
 
 THE STAT II:  This marked the first game this season the Thunder lead from start to finish. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  A solid third quarter. In last week's loss to the Clippers, OKC was outscored 30-16 in the third quarter after leading by nine at halftime. Tonight the Thunder led by eight at the break and outscored LA by one point (30-29) in the third quarter. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We never really had a moment where we got stops and then scored. We would score and they would score or we got a stop and then they got a stop. We didn't come down and execute." 
 -- Griffin 
 
 
 HOT:  The Thunder shot 68.8 percent (11-for-16) in the first 10 minutes and 57.9 percent (22-for-38) in the second half...Ibaka was 5-for-5 (11 points) in the second half and now in 48 minutes against the Clippers this season Ibaka has scored 30 points on 14-for-16 shooting...Griffin was 9-for-15 (21 points) in the last 24 minutes. 
 
 NOT:  The Clippers missed their first seven shots and were 19-for-49 (38.8 percent) in the first half...OKC normally one of the best free throw shooting teams in the NBA missed 10 shots from the stripe tonight (19-for-29) hitting just 65.5 percent. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  Stars on the court and in the courtside seats tonight in OKC. Music superstars  Jay-Z  and  Beyonce  sat courtside and so did ESPN's  Kirk Herbstreit . Jay-Z is now Durant's agent and Herbsreit is in Oklahoma for Saturday's Oklahoma State-Baylor football game in Stillwater. They were part of the 118th consecutive sellout at Chesapeake Energy Arena. For the second straight game, a Thunder fan hit a big-money shot. During a break in the second quarter, high school business teacher  Brad Brucker  hit a half court shot worth $20,000. It's the eighth time in five seasons a fan has hit the big money ball. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "That's crazy, I don't even know how to describe that right there. That's unbelievable for them to come to Oklahoma City and watch us play." 
 -- Durant on  Jay-Z   and  Beyonce  being in the house. 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  After being burned on an alley-oop from Griffin to Jordan earlier in the game, Ibaka sees it coming late in the second and leaps to block Jordan's dunk attempt. 
 
 GOOD MOVE TOO:  The Thunder were embarrassed on the boards the first time these teams met last week, but at halftime OKC had 30 rebounds to 22 for L.A. and had outscored the Clippers in the paint 28-16. At the end the Thunder outrebounded the Clippers 49-41 and outscored them in the paint 58-32. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Thunder center  Steven Adams  had a solid night with six points, seven rebounds and three b locked shots. Clippers guard  Reggie Bullock  finished with five points and two rebounds. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Clippers announced tonight that  Matt Barnes  will miss at least two weeks after having surgery on his left eye. What was originally thought to be a contusion turned out to be a retinal tear...OKC is now 5-0 at home this season, the team's best home start since moving from Seattle. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Clippers: Saturday @ Sacramento, Sunday vs. Indiana, Wednesday @ Atlanta. For the Thunder: Sunday vs. Utah, Wednesday vs. San Antonio, Friday vs. Golden State.
