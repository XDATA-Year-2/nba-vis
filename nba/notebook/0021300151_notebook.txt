 THE FACT:  The Chicago Bulls have their first five-game winning streak since Feb. 29-March 7, 2012. 
 
 THE LEAD: Luol Deng  scored 21 points and  Carlos Boozer  had a double-double with 12 points and 17 rebounds to lead the host Chicago Bulls to a hard-fought 86-81 victory over the Charlotte Bobcats Monday.  Jeffery Taylor  came off the bench for the Bobcats to score a career-high 20 points.    
 
 THE FACTS II:  The Bulls led by as many as 10 points in the first half, but the Bobcats led 44-40 at halftime. The Bulls scored six of the first eight points of the second half and did not trail the rest of the game. 
 
 QUOTABLE I:  "It was a tough, hard-fought game and I liked that Derrick showed a lot of perseverance. He had timely buckets late."  --  Bulls coach  Tom Thibodeau  on  Derrick Rose's  poor shooting night (4-for-13).  
 
 
 THE STAT:  Both teams shot 36 percent from the field, and at one point in the fourth quarter both teams were shooting just 30 percent from the field. 
 
 THE STAT II:  The Bulls outscored the Bobcats 26-8 from the free throw line. The Bulls were 26-for-31 and the Bobcats were 8-for-16.    
 
 THE STAT III:  The Bobcats had only two turnovers at halftime, while the Bulls had 10. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  It was still a game until Deng made a 3-pointer with 27 seconds left to give the Bulls a four-point lead, 85-81.  
 
 INJURY UPDATE: Al Jefferson , who has only played three games for the Bobcats this season because of an ankle injury, could be back with the team by the end of the week. Bulls swingman  Jimmy Butler  injured his toe and played just 22 minutes.    
 
 HOT : Bulls forward Deng has scored 63 points in the last three games, and has hit 21 of 39 shots.  
 
 NOT:  Boozer ranked in the league's top 10 in field goal percentage before missing eight of his first nine shots and going 5-for-17 in the game. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "There were a lot of opportunities on the offensive glass."  --  Bulls center  Joakim Noah , talking about the field goal percentage in the game and why they ended up at the free throw line 31 times. 
 
 
 G OOD MOVE:  When they figured they weren't going to make 2-point shots, both teams fired up 3-point shots and made them.  The Bobcats made 7 of 16 and the Bulls were 6-for-12. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Charlotte rookie center  Cody Zeller  scored six points and had six rebounds in 19 minutes.   
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "If you are outscored by 18 (at the free throw line), you can't win."  --  Charlotte coach  Steve Clifford .  
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Boozer had a season high with 17 rebounds, the most by a Bulls player this season... Charlotte's Taylor has scored in double figures five times in seven games played... the Bulls take off on a six-game road trip while the circus visits the United Center... Charlotte entered the game shooting a league-worst 40.2 percent and shot 36.3 percent Monday... the Bobcats bench had 36 points and the starters had 45.   
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Bulls, @ Denver Thursday, @ Portland Friday, @ L.A. Clippers Sunday. For the Bobcats, vs. Brooklyn Wednesday, vs. Phoenix Friday, at Milwaukee Saturday.
