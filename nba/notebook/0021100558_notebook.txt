  Notebook: Bucks 97, Sixers 93 Posted Monday March 5, 2012 11:42PM By Rick Braun, for NBA.com     THE FACTS: Beno Udrih  snapped a 93-93 tie with a 15-footer with 58.2 seconds left,  Brandon Jennings  scored 33 points and  Drew Gooden  added 25 points and 10 rebounds as the Milwaukee Bucks scrapped out a 97-93 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday night at the Bradley Center. Ersan Ilyasova  added 11 points and 18 rebounds for the Bucks (15-23), who snapped a three-game losing streak. Lou Williams  led the 76ers (22-17) with 26 points, but his driving attempt at a tying basket rolled off with 8 seconds left. QUOTABLE:  "It was a grind-out game. We held them to a low percentage from the field, and they still had 20 offensive rebounds. We kept containing them. They had a lot of second-chance points and a lot of points in the paint, but we grinded it out. We responded when we needed to respond."   -- Gooden THE STAT:  With both teams shooting under 40 percent, five players had double-digit rebounds led by Ilyasova's 18. The two teams combined for 100 rebounds, with the Sixers winning the battle, 53-47. TURNING POINT:  While Gooden did a lot of good things with his 25 and 10 night, his biggest play was getting into the lane and getting into the air. When the Philadelphia defense converged on him, he kicked the ball to the left wing, where Udrih was wide-open for the go-ahead shot. QUOTABLE II:  "Just attacking. One thing is I'm trying to get to the free throw line more, just throwing my body in there. I'm trying to pick up the pace a little bit."   -- Jennings, who scored 19 of his 33 points in the first quarter HOT:  On a night with both teams throwing up brick after brick, Jennings' 11-for-23 qualifies, especially taking into account his 4-for-8 showing on 3-pointers. NOT:  Sixers guard  Evan Turner  was just 1-for-12 but did contribute 12 rebounds to match his career high. INSIDE THE ARENA:  The stars were out in the Bradley Center. Green Bay Packers quarterback  Aaron Rodgers , the NFL's Most Valuable Player, was in attendance, as was Miss America  Laura Kaeppler , a Wisconsin native. Kaeppler sang the National Anthem before the game. GOOD MOVE:  Bucks coach  Scott Skiles  played point guards Jennings and Udrih together for the entire fourth quarter, and the Milwaukee offense did just enough to hold on. ROOKIE WATCH:  Bucks forward  Tobias Harris  started for second straight game and made the only two shots he took but only played 2 1/2 minutes after halftime and 14:46 overall. NOTABLE:  Bucks forward  Luc Richard Mbah a Moute  missed the game with a sore right knee. Mbah a Moute missed 10 games in the first three weeks with tendinitis in that knee. ... Bucks swingman  Stephen Jackson  missed his seventh straight game with a sore right hamstring. ... Milwaukee trailed much of the game before a 15-0 run that spanned the end of the third and start of the fourth quarters turned a 71-65 deficit into an 80-71 lead. ... The Bucks won their second straight home game after a six-game home losing streak. ... Skiles celebrated his 48th birthday Monday. UP NEXT:  For the 76ers, Wednesday vs. Boston, Friday vs. Utah, Sunday @ New York. For the Bucks, Wednesday vs. Chicago, Friday vs. New York, Sunday @ Toronto.
