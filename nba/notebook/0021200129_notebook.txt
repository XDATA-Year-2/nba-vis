 THE FACTS:   Nicolas Batum  tied his career high with 35 points and rookie  Damian Lillard  put up 18 of his season-high 27 points after intermission as Portland upended Houston 119-117 Friday night in overtime at the Rose Garden. It was the Blazers' second overtime win over the Rockets in two weeks. Portland prevailed 95-85 at Houston on Nov. 23.  LaMarcus Aldridge  tied his season high with 29 points for the Blazers (4-5), including a turnaround 10-footer with 37 seconds left in overtime that provided a 119-116 lead.  James Harden  led Houston (4-5) with 29 points.
 
 
 QUOTABLE: " We make it interesting, but we've made it clear this year that we compete to the end. For long stretches of the game, it wasn't the way we wanted it. But when it mattered most, we played pretty well."  
 -- Portland coach  Terry Stotts
 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Houston finished with a 24-11 advantage in fast-break points, but the Rockets had a 17-1 edge in the first half. There was a 24-1 differential four minutes into the second half. From that point on, for the final 25 minutes of the game, the Blazers outscored the visitors 8-0 in that category.
 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Houston led by 13 points late in the third quarter when Portland closed the quarter on a 14-2 run to get within one entering the final period.
 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We guarded them the way we wanted to guard them. Sometimes you just have to tip your hat and say, 'Batum, those are great shots. Lillard, those are great shots.'"  
 --Houston interim coach  Kelvin Sampson  on Houston's defense against Batum and Lillard 
 
 HOT:  Batum, especially in the third quarter, when he scored 14 points on 5-for-6 shooting, including 2-for-2 from 3-point range. And Lillard, who bombed in 11 points in the fourth quarter and another five in overtime.
 
 
 NOT:  Houston reserve point guard  Toney Douglas , who played much of the fourth quarter and overtime in place of starter  Jeremy Lin . Douglas was 2-for-11 from the field, including 0-for-5 on 3-point attempts.
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  After Harden came up with the ball near midcourt with a couple of seconds remaining in overtime and Portland ahead 119-116,  Wesley Matthews  intentionally fouled Harden with 1.4 seconds left. Harden made the first gift shot but was forced to intentionally miss the second. The rebound bounced harmlessly away and the Blazers were triumphant.
 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Houston's  Omer Asik,  who had 15 points and 16 rebounds in 44 minutes, fouled Aldridge in the act of shooting with 1:21 left in overtime and the score tied 116-116. It was Asik's sixth foul and the Rockets couldn't afford to lose their 7-foot center. Moments later, Aldridge scored on a turnaround jumper over 6-foot-9 forward  Patrick Patterson .
 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "I make one shot, two shots, three shots, and I start to feel it a little bit. So I just keep shooting."  
 --Blazers forward Nicolas Batum, who finished 13-for-19 from the field, including 5-for-8 from 3-point range 
 
 NOTABLE:  Three Blazers scored at least 27 points in a game for the first time since Nov. 14, 1997, when  Isaiah Rider  had 35 points,  Brian Grant  had 34 points and  Arvydas Sabonis  scored 31.
 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Rockets, Sunday @ L.A. Lakers, Monday @ Utah, Wednesday vs. Chicago.  For the Trail Blazers, Sunday vs. Chicago, Wednesday @ Phoenix, Friday vs. Minnesota.
