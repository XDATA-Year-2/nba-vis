
 Suns-Hawks notebook   By Matt Winkeljohn, for NBA.com Posted Sunday November 7, 2010 9:17PM THE FACTS:  The Suns were 2-3 before playing their fifth game in six outings against an opponent that had won 50 or more games last season, and yet Phoenix knocked the host Hawks from the ranks of the unbeaten with a 118-114 win. Phoenix won with balance, as  Jason Richardson's  21 points were the most among 10 Suns players who scored -- all at least six points. Atlanta's  Joe Johnson  scored 34 and Al Horford 30, but the short-handed Hawks (6-1) had just seven players score. Eight Suns scored in the decisive fourth quarter, when the score was tied four times, and Phoenix hit 10 of 11 free throws. QUOTABLE:  "I'm glad we had a brutal schedule to start because we've played good in those games. We've shown that we can battle back and keep on fighting and get a victory."    --  Richardson THE STAT:  46-19 -- The Suns' advantage in scoring off the bench, as Atlanta missed starting small forward  Marvin Williams  (bruised knee bone) and reserve guard/forward  Maurice Evans  (knee) and other players had to move up in the rotation.  Jason Collins  made his second career start at center, and went scoreless in four-plus minutes for Atlanta. Three Atlanta starters played 42 minutes or more, and the Hawks play Monday night at Atlanta. TURNING POINT:  Phoenix caught Atlanta in a switch when the 6-foot-11  Channing Frye  took a feed from  Steve Nash  on the right block while being defending by Atlanta point guard  Mike Bibby  (6-2). Frye's 11-foot turnaround jumper with 24 seconds left in the game broke the final tie. With a 114-112 lead, the Suns sealed the victory with four free throws by Nash in the final 6.7 seconds. "The thing that hurt us, as far as switches, [was] we couldn't match up the way we wanted," said Atlanta coach  Larry Drew . "Tonight is a clear case of how bad we needed Marvin and Mo." QUOTABLE II : "Horford, I don't know if there's a guy in the league that works harder than him. It doesn't matter how you slice it, on the offensive end, the defensive end, rebounding . . . that's a bargain, whatever they signed him for. He's a stud."   --  Phoenix coach  Alvin Gentry  without even being asked about Hawks center-forward Al Horford after he scored 30 points, grabbed 10 rebounds, dished out five assists, blocked two shots and added a steal with one turnover in 42-plus minutes. HOT:  After making 13 of 16 shots, Horford has made 50 of 73 shots in Atlanta's past six games (68.5 percent) while averaging 10.7 rebounds in that span. He's put up five double-doubles in that time. . . . Richardson has made at least two 3-pointers in all six Phoenix games, and has hit 16 of 32 over the past four games. NOT:  Phoenix center  Robin Lopez , who scored seven points on 3 of 4 shooting with just one rebound Sunday, has 11 points and eight rebounds combined in his past three games. Other than an 18-point, 14-rebound effort in a loss to the Lakers, he has averaged 4.0 ppg and 3.8 rpg in the Suns' other five games. NOTABLE:  The Suns took a 61-50 halftime lead by making 6 of 14 treys in the first two quarters, and while Atlanta shot 53.7 percent in that first half, the Hawks missed all eight of their 3-point tries. Atlanta was torrid in the third quarter, scoring 38 points on 14 of 20 shooting and 6 of 10 from long distance. Still, Phoenix led 90-88 after three quarters thanks in part to Richardson scoring 13 points in the period. ... Nash's 15 assists marked the first time this season he's been in double digits. Also, with just two turnovers, it was the first time this season that the two-time MVP did not turn the ball over at least three times. He was averaging 5.6 turnovers coming in. ... Atlanta's  Josh Smith  (the league leader entering the game) broke a tie with  Dikembe Mutomobo  (1996-2001) for second-most blocked shots in franchise history. Smith, whose 1,095 blocked shots trail only  Wayne "Tree" Rollins'  2,283 in Hawks' annals, added 19 points, nine rebounds, and four assists. Rollins played from 1977-88 with Atlanta. Smith has been with the Hawks since 2004. UP NEXT:  For the Suns, Monday @ Memphis, Friday vs. Sacramento, Sunday @ L.A. Lakers. For the Hawks, Monday @ Orlando, Wednesday vs. Milwaukee, Friday vs. Utah.
