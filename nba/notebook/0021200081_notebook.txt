 THE FACTS:  Philadelphia 76ers (4-2) defeat the Toronto Raptors (1-5) at the Air Canada Centre 93-83 on Saturday.  The 76ers now make it an even 16-16 in Toronto all-time, 33-32 overall between the franchises. 
 The Raptors were held to 26% field goal shooting to drop their third straight game. The 76ers outscored the home team 32-7 in the second quarter which the put them in the lead for good.   
 The Raptors bright spots were  Andrea Bargnani  who led the three double-figure scorers with a game-high 23 points followed by  DeMar DeRozan  who had 19 and  Jose Calderon  who had a double-double with 14 points and 11 assists.  
 Philadelphia had five players in double figures led by  Thaddeus Young, Nick Young , and guard  Jrue Holiday  all of whom had 16 points a piece with Nick's coming off the bench. Big man  Spencer Hawes  had the lone double-double for the Sixers with 12 points and 11 rebounds off the bench. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We were down in there in the first quarter, got it to six and the second unit was fantastic, Spencer (Hawes), Swaggy (Nick Young) and  Royal (Ivey) , and that was the difference in the game." -- 76ers head coach  Doug Collins  on the key second quarter run. 
 
 THE STAT:   The Raptors were held to 2-of-20 from the field in the second quarter and made their only two free throws for a total of seven points.  In comparison, the 76ers were 13-of-18 from the floor and 4-of-6 from the line for 32. 
 
 TURNING POINT:   With the game seesawing back and forth in the fourth quarter, the Raptors were poised to make one final run being down 83-69 when DeRozan, unhappy with a no-call voiced his displeasure.  The result was a technical foul with 3:46 to play and with  Evan Turner  sinking a free throw to increase the lead to 14.  That sequence took the wind out of the Raptors' sails and they never got closer than ten points and that effectively ended the home team's hopes of a comeback.  
 
 NOTABLE:  Raptor guard  Alan Anderson , who replaced injured teammate  Landry Fields  in the starting lineup, left the game with 5 seconds in the third quarter with a sprained left foot. This now has Raptors with potentially three rotation players on the bench for their next game against the Boston Celtics Monday.  
 
 UP NEXT:   For the Raptors, Monday vs. Utah, Tuesday @ Indiana, Saturday @ Boston.  For Sixers, Monday vs. Milwaukee, Wednesday vs. Detroit, Friday vs. Utah.
