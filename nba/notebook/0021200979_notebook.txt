 THE FACTS :   Martell Webster  scored a career-high 34 points with seven 3-pointers and the Washington Wizards finished 14-for-21 from beyond the arc en route to scoring their most points on the season in a 127-105 drubbing of the Phoenix Suns on Saturday night. 
 
 John Wall  had 17 points and 11 assists for his third double-double in his last four games, while  Emeka Okafor  had 17 points and 10 rebounds for the Wizards (23-42). Washington took control by scoring 75 points combined in the second and third quarters en route to completing its homestand 3-0. 
    Webster made 7-for-10 3-point attempts, including all four in the third quarter as the Wizards turned a 66-59 halftime lead into a 102-83 advantage entering the fourth. Washington made 14 of their 22 shots in the third quarter. 
 
  Michael Beasley  scored 21 points,  Jared Dudley  had 16 and  Goran Dragic  finished with 12 points and 11 assists for the Suns (22-45). Phoenix trailed by 23 points in this one, and has lost four straight and six of seven.  
 
 QUOTABLE : "Martell is weird sometimes. He was in his own zone, doing the Michael-Jordan shrug when he hit that last one. ...He had a big night for us." 
 -- John Wall on Webster's night 
 
 THE STAT : Second in the NBA with a 45.3 3-point shooting percentage, Webster has made at least four 3-pointers in five straight games, establishing a franchise record. 
 
 QUOTABLE II :  ""I would love to be here next year, but it's a business, so we'll see what happens. I'm having an extraordinary time here. The city is great, the fans are great, my teammates are awesome." 
 -- Martell Webster, responding to Wall's comment about wanting the team to resign the upcoming free agent 
 
 HOT : Beasley, who grew up in the local Maryland suburbs, went 6-for-7 during the second quarter, scoring 16 points. The 6-foot-10 forward turned a beautiful spin move into a thunderous dunk over  Nene , but picked up one of Phoenix's four technical foul's after the play for taunting.  
 
 NOT : While the Wizards could not miss from long range, Phoenix finished 6-for-21 from beyond the arc. Dragic and Dudley were a combined 2-for-9. 
 
 GOOD MOVE :  After missing the last five games with a sprained right ankle,  Bradley Beal  returned and scored 13 points in 21 minutes off the bench. The rookie knocked down 3 of his 4 3-point attempts. 
 
 QUOTABLE III :  ""I was embarrassed tonight, and I know our guys feel the same way. The amount of points we gave up, the amount of 3's we gave up, rebounds, there was no aspect that we brought our focus to. And, like I just told our guys, we'll practice as long as hard as we need to to fix everything." 
 -- Suns interim coach  Linds e y Hunter 
 
 
  NOTABLE :  Each team had six double figure scorers. Nene added 14 for the Wizards and  Garrett Temple  scored 11, also going 3-for-4 from beyond the arc. ... Markieff Morris  scored 13 for the Suns, but 11 came in the first quarter. ... Washington improved its home record to 18-17. The last time the Wizards were above .500 at home 35 games into a season was during the 2007-08 campaign. ... The Wizards also set a season-high with 66 first-half points. That is the most allowed by the Suns this season. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Suns, Monday vs. Lakers, Wednesday vs. Wizards, Friday vs. Timberwolves. For the Wizards...Monday @ Bobcats, Wednesday @ Suns, Friday @ Lakers
