 THE FACT: Kyle Korver  ties the NBA record with a 3-pointer in his 89th straight game in a Hawks win over the Clippers. 
 
 THE LEAD:   Paul Millsap  scored a game-high 25 points and  Kyle Korver  added 23 with six 3-pointers, as the Atlanta Hawks beat the Los Angeles Clippers 107-97 Wednesday night at Philips Arena. Korver's first 3-point basket, 30 seconds into the game, tied  Dana Barros ' NBA record for consecutive games with at least one trey at 89. The Hawks, who had three 20-point scorers, shot 51.2 percent and led the final 43 minutes of the game, thanks in large part to Millsap, who also pulled down nine rebounds, doled out six assists and blocked three shots.  Al Horford  added 21 and nine for the Hawks.  Blake Griffin  led the Clippers with 24, and  Chris Paul  had his 102nd career double-double and 16th in 17 games this season, scoring 19 while handing out 11 assists. The win was the Hawks fifth straight over the Clippers at Philips Arena and denied  Doc Rivers  his 600th career coaching victory. 
 
 THE STAT:  12-for-23/4-for-19: Downtown Atlanta beat downtown L.A. Wednesday night. The Hawks drained a season-high 12 3-pointers and shot a season-high 52.2 percent from behind the arc. The Clippers shot a frosty 21 percent (4-for-19) from long range. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Atlanta's inside game was too much for the Clippers all game long. With 4:50 left in the first quarter, following a Griffin slam that made the score 13-11, Horford and Millsap combined to score 10 straight points to push the lead back to double digits. The Clippers never got closer than five the rest of the game and trailed by double digits most of the way. A key to the Hawks' big first quarter was their 12-0 edge in second-chance points. 
 
 HOT:  Millsap came out blazing and the Clippers never found an answer for him. He scored his 25 points on 12-for-21 shooting with 11 of them coming in the first quarter, when he shot 5-for-7. Millsap was even feeling it from downtown, hitting a 3-pointer in a season high fifth straight game. Prior to this current run, he'd made one 3-pointer in his previous nine games. Clippers guard  Jamal Crawford , who won NBA Sixth Man of the Year while with Atlanta during the 2009-10 season, reminded the Hawks why, hitting four of his first five shots in the first half, 3-for-4 in a three-minute span in the second quarter. 
 
 NOT:  The absence of  J.J. Redick  was profoundly felt, as  Jared Dudley  and Crawford, two of the Clippers' top 3-point shooters, combined to shoot 1-for-9 from 3-point range. Paul was 0-for-3 from downtown as the Clippers made two fewer 3-pointers as a team than Korver by himself. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Our [issue] wasn't offensive tonight. It was defensive. Our overall defense was poor. The first play of the game Korver got a three and that was indicative of our defense all night."  
 -- Doc Rivers 
 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I think the happiest person was my wife. I was just not fun to be around the last five days at the house. I couldn't really exercise. The team was on the road so I can't help them out. I'm just sitting at home watching season one of Arrow. I don't think I was very pleasant to be around, so I'm glad it's done."  
 -- Kyle Korver on getting back in the lineup 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Korver tied Barros by hitting his first 3-pointer. Korver has hit at least one trey in 89 straight games...The Hawks' 28 assists Wednesday marked the 18th time in their last 20 games that they've had at least 20 assists...Among Millsap's achievements Wednesday was scoring his 7,000th point and handing out his 1,000th assist...The Clippers got a solid contribution from their bench, outscoring the Hawks 30-20...  DeAndre Jordan  grabbed 13 rebounds, four offensive, both game highs... Shelvin Mack  came up big off the bench, tying his season high with 12 points on 5-for-9 shooting. Mack also matched his season high of four rebounds, had five assists and a steal. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Hawks, Friday vs. Cleveland, Tuesday vs. Oklahoma City, Friday vs. Washington. For the Clippers, Thursday @ Memphis, Saturday @ Cleveland, Monday @ Philadelphia.
