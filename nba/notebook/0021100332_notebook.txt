  Notebook: Raptors 106, Wizards 89   By Duane Watson, for NBA.com Posted Friday February 3, 2012 11:08PM THE FACTS:  The Toronto Raptors' (8-16) bench was the difference tonight against the Washington Wizards (4-19), leading them to a 106-89 win in Toronto. The Raptors bench was active and outscored the Wizards starters 63-54. Led by the efforts of  Leandro Barbosa's  game high 19 points and 3 steals,  Amir Johnson's  18 points, 13 rebounds and 3 blocks and  Linas Kleiza's  scored 15, all from the bench. Raptors starters James Johnson had 13 points,  DeMar DeRozan  11 and  Jose Calderon  scored 8 with a season high 17 assists and 8 rebounds. The Wizards were led by  Nick Young's  21 points, while  John Wall  contributed 15. For a game that was 55-45 at halftime, the Raptors played a decisive fourth quarter sending the Wizards on their way adding to their putrid 1-10 record on the road. The Raptors pounded the glass and out rebounded Washington 61-37, including 23-11 on the offensive glass and outworked them earning 28 second chance points to Washington's 13. QUOTABLE:  "It was definitely great, that's what he does. He is definitely an energy guy. He likes coming off the bench and brings that type of energy for us, his rebounding and when he gets a chance to score on the screen and rolls he definitely takes advantage of it."   --Raptors guard  DeMar DeRozan  on the play of  Amir Johnson . THE STAT:  13 assists for the Washington Wizards. The Wizards inability to move the ball was one of many problems tonight. Point guard  John Wall  had 4 assists. They turned the ball over, couldn't complete plays, settled for one on one situations or simply couldn't finish. They entered the third quarter with 8 assists and added the other 5 in the fourth quarter when the team was already down 11. Calderon's 17 assists were more than the Wizards team combined. TURNING POINT:  Despite the Raptors entering the fourth frame with an 11 point lead, they started the quarter with a 15-8 run and and extended the lead to their biggest of the game at 22 points. QUOTABLE II:  "It was very tough to win when you get out rebounded by 24 points against anybody. That was the main thing they beat us on. We tried to make runs but they would miss a shot and get the offensive rebound. That wore us down because we had to work more on defense."   -- Wizards forward  Trevor Booker HOT:   Johnson and Barbosa contributed 12 points, 5 rebounds and 2 blocks on 5-for- 5 shooting and 9 points and 1 steal and 1 block respectively, for the Raptors in the second quarter alone. Johnson finished the game with 18 points, 13 rebounds and 3 blocks, while Barbosa had 19 points, 2 rebounds and 3 steals. The duo was the key and while Barbosa has been performing well of late, Johnson's play may be a sign that someone else is willing to help pick up the slack in  Andrea Bargnani's  absence. NOT:  Which category do you choose for the Wizards? They were overwhelmed significantly in numerous statistical categories tonight: rebounds 61-37, bench scoring: 63-35, points in the paint: 68-38 and second chance points: 28-13. It's hard to find a positive in their performance and their 1-10 record on the road proves that. GOOD MOVE:  With the Raptors utilizing their small line up with  DeRozan playing the small forward position matched up against the taller  Rashard Lewis  at 6-foot-10, head coach  Dwane Casey  made an adjustment and inserted Kleiza to even the match up. Kleiza went on to score 15 points, including 3-for-3 from the 3-point line, of the bench, while Lewis shot 3-for-10 with 8 points. NOTABLE:  28 second chance points is a franchise high, eclipsing their previous total of 22 on December 22nd 2005 vs. Atlanta... The Wizards are now 1-10 on the road this season... The Raptors have won four games in a row at home against the Wizard... The Raptors 23 offensive rebounds was their most since December 22nd 2009 vs. Washington where they had 22... UP NEXT:  Toronto takes their talents to South Beach on Sunday @Miami, Monday @ Washington, vs. Milwaukee. For Washington they have a home stand facing Saturday vs. Clippers, Monday vs. Toronto and Wednesday vs. New York.
