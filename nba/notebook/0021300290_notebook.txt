 THE FACT:  The Nuggets have performed well in Philadelphia in recent years and they have now won seven of their last 12 games here. 
 
 THE LEAD: Nate Robinson  led five players in double figures with 20 points and the Denver Nuggets broke open a close game late en route to a 103-92 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers Saturday night at the Wells Fargo Center.  Jordan Hamilton  and  Randy Foye  scored 13 points apiece,  J.J. Hickson  added 12 and  Wilson Chandler  had 10 for the Nuggets, who improved to 12-8. 
 
 Tony Wroten  paced the Sixers with 20 points.  Thaddeus Young  and  Spencer Hawes  scored 14 each and  Hollis Thompson  added 10. The Sixers fell to 6-6 at home and 7-14 overall. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "He found open windows. He's capable of getting hot and stringing together shots." --  Nuggets coach  Brian Shaw , on Hamilton, who hit three clutch treys in the fourth quarter. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Nuggets received 54 points from their bench. Six reserves got playing time with Robinson leading the way with 20 points. This was the sixth time this season that the Nuggets' bench produced 50 or more points. 
 
 TURNING POINT : The game was tied at 86 midway through the fourth quarter and very much up for grabs. But the Nuggets ripped off an impressive 15-2 run highlighted by three 3-pointers from Hamilton for a 101-88 lead with 1:47 remaining. Hamilton's three triples came within a span of 1:04. 
 
 HOT:  Hamilton knocked down four of his five shots, including all three of his 3-pointers. Hickson was 5-for-9. Wroten was 10-for-20 for the Sixers. 
 
 NOT:  Turner struggled from the field and finished just 3-for-12. He also didn't attempt one free throw. 
 
 GOOD MOVE : Just like he has all season, Shaw went deep to his bench until he found the right combination. The Nuggets looked fresh in the fourth, especially down the stretch. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Sixers didn't attack the basket nearly enough. They attempted only 14 free throws compared to 34 for the Nuggets. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The crowd of 13,113 was very spirited for much of the game until the Nuggets pulled away at the end. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We found a way to contain them and force them to take some tough shots." --  Nuggets guard  Andre Miller ,  on their defense in the fourth. 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Sixers rookie point guard  Michael Carter-Williams  missed his second straight game because of right knee soreness caused by a skin infection on the front of that knee. Carter-Williams is currently at Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania for further evaluation. He is listed as day-to-day. ... Nuggets guard  Ty Lawson  (left hamstring strain) sat out and was replaced by Miller in the starting lineup ... Hickson swept 10 rebounds for a double-double. He has five double-doubles this season. ... Denver outrebounded Philadelphia 52-38. ... The Nuggets are 12-5 since starting the season 0-3. ... Wroten reached the 20-point plateau for the fourth time this season. ... Thompson had a career-high tying nine rebounds. ... The Sixers are 1-9 when scoring below 100 points this season. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "They were just knocking down shot after shot. They made the right plays." --  Thaddeus Young , on the Nuggets' performance in the fourth. 
 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Nuggets, Monday @ Washington, Friday vs. Utah, Dec. 15 vs. New Orleans. For the Sixers, Monday vs. L.A. Clippers, Wednesday @ Minnesota, Friday @ Toronto.
