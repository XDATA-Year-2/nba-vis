 THE FACT:  According to the Elias Sports Bureau, this was the first time in NBA history that two rookies --  Michael Carter-Williams  and  Victor Oladipo  -- recorded triple-doubles in the same game.  
 
 THE LEAD:  Carter-Williams scored 27 points, swept a career-best 12 rebounds and added 10 assists in leading the Philadelphia 76ers to a thrilling 126-125 victory over the Orlando Magic in double overtime Tuesday night at the Wells Fargo Center.   Thaddeus Young  had 25 points and 12 rebounds and  Evan Turner  scored 24 points.  James Anderson  had 19 off the bench,  Spencer Hawes  contributed 17 and  Hollis Thompson  had 10. The Sixers improved to 7-12 and snapped a four-game losing streak. 
 
 Arron Afflalo  led the Magic with a career-high 43 points.  Glen Davis  also scored a career-best 33 points. Oladipo was tremendous as well with 26 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds.  Jason Maxiell  had 12 points for the Magic, who fell to 6-12. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We put the ball in his hands and trust him to make the right decision. And he did." 
 -- Hawes on Carter-Williams . 
 
 THE STAT:  The Sixers won despite allowing the Magic to shoot 50 percent from the field. The Sixers were 0-3 when that had occurred this season and were 1-18 in 2012-13. 
 
 TURNING POINT:   There were so many twists and turns in this game. It came down to the Sixers making just enough plays at the end of the second overtime. 
 
 HOT:  Carter-Williams was 11-for-19 and Young was 10-for-20. Davis knocked down 15 of his 24 shots while Afflalo was 14-for-27. 
 
 NOT:   Ronnie Price  was 0-for-6 for the Magic.  Lavoy Allen  struggled for the Sixers, going 0-for-4 in 14:22. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Sixers kept the ball in Carter-Williams' hands and let him run the offense. He played 46:32 with a swollen knee, but played at an extremely high level and made great choices down the stretch. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  On this night, it was simply two teams fighting and scrapping until the very end.  
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The crowd of 10,061 was treated to a heck of a matchup. As the game continued in double overtime, the decibel level got louder. Former Eagles linebacker  Jeremiah Trotter  attended the game and received a nice ovation. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We came to play today, but we didn't finish it." 
 -- Davis 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Shortly before tipoff, Carter-Williams was named the NBA Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month for October and November. He is the first Sixer to win the award since  Allen Iverson  in April of 1997. ... The Magic played without center  Nikola Vucevic  (ankle), guard  Jameer Nelson  (sprained left foot) and forward  Tobias Harris  (left ankle). ... Afflalo became the first Magic player to score 40 or more points since  Dwight Howard  had 45 at Golden State on Jan. 12, 2012. ... The only other Orlando rookie to record a triple-double was  Penny Hardaway  at Boston on April 15, 1994. ... The last Sixer to earn a triple-double was  Andre Iguodala  against Detroit on March 23, 2005. ... This was the second double-overtime game of the season for the Sixers. ... Davis tied the game at 104 with a 3-pointer with 18.1 seconds remaining in regulation. It was Davis' first trey of the season and his first since the 2011-12 season. He had been 6-for-40 from beyond the arc in his career heading into this game. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "He was fantastic. He showed tremendous leadership." 
 -- Sixers coach  Brett Brown  on Young.
