 THE FACT:  The Raptors starting backcourt scored a combined 51 points on 19-of-35 shooting. The rest of the team managed 57 points on 20-47. 
 
 THE LEAD:   DeMar DeRozan  scored a game-high 27 points and  Terrence Ross  added a season-high 24 as the Toronto Raptors (8-13) withstood a late Philadelphia 76ers (7-17) comeback to defeat them 108-100.  
 Starting in place of the injured point guard  Michael Carter-Williams ,  Tony Wroten  did his best to keep the 76ers in the game, scoring 23 points on 8-17 from the floor.  Evan Turner  provided some support with 21 points and 10 rebounds, while  Thaddeus Young  dropped 18 and five.  
 The Raptors started the game hot, sharing the ball beautifully and jumping out to a 10-2 run. Toronto poured in 36 points in the frame and took a 14-point lead into the second quarter.  
 The 76ers answered with a run of their own, opening the second quarter 10-0.  
 The teams traded runs until late in the fourth. A layup by Wroten at 1:55 brought the 76ers within two points, 100-98. The Raptors responded immediately as Ross hit a 3-pointer and then  Amir Johnson  came up with a big block on Wroten on the other end, sufficiently stopping any moment Philadelphia had built up.  
 DeRozan scored on back-to-back possessions to seal the deal for the Raptors.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We had some big time turnovers in the second quarter, trying to force some passes that weren't there. I thought we cleaned that up in the second half. Getting familiarity with new guys, old guys, but that's the type of ball movement we have to have." 
 -- Raptors head coach  Dwane Casey  on his team sharing the ball 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Raptors tied a season-high with 24 assists.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  Back-to-back-to-back threes by  Grievis Vasquez , Johnson and Vasquez again pushed the Raptor lead to 96-82 with seven and a half minutes left.  The 76ers battled back, making a game of things down the stretch, but the Raptors would not relinquish the lead after this point.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "He's a great player, he finds people when they are open. I just happened to be open tonight. I just took the best of my shots, tried to hone in and start making them." 
 -- Raptors guard   Ross on playing with DeRozan. 
 
 
 HOT:   Ross had an excellent first quarter, scoring 12 of his 24 points on 5-of-6 shooting in the frame. He also hit 4-of-7 from beyond the 3-point line.  
 
 HOT:   Wroten single-handedly kept his team in the game at times, particularly during the Sixers big second-quarter run, making clutch 3-point baskets and attacking the Raptors in the paint. Wroten led his team in points with 23 and made threes with five.  
 
 HOT : After being reinserted into the starting lineup, Raptors forward Johnson has responded with the stellar play that is typical of the 26-year-old veteran. Johnson scored 17 points, hauled in 10 rebounds and had two game changing blocked shots.   
 
 NOT:   Patrick Patterson  went just 1-5 in 19 minutes in his Raptor debut.  
 
 QUOTABLE III:   "You see it. Terrence [Ross] definitely works hard. Every time we practice against each other I go at him just to try and give him a lesson and give him that extra confidence when he is out there on the court. He can do it all." 
 -- Raptors guard DeRozan on teammate Ross  
 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Raptors began the second quarter with the three newly acquired players sharing the floor. The 76ers promptly went on a 10-0 run, erasing a 14-point deficit.  
 
 NOTABLE:   Three out of the four players the Raptors acquired in the  Rudy Gay  trade with the Sacramento Kings suited up for Toronto... Chuck Hayes  did not dress as he is still in the midst of undergoing baseline cardiac tests...76ers rookie sensation  Michael Carter-Williams  missed his fifth straight game with a right knee infection... Raptors forward  Tyler Hansbrough  returned to action after missing two straight games with a shoulder injury. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Raptors, Saturday @ Chicago, Wednesday vs. Charlotte, December 20th @ Dallas. For the 76ers, Saturday vs. Portland, Monday @ Brooklyn, December 20 vs. Brooklyn.
