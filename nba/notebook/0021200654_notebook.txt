 THE FACTS: Brandon Knight 's career-high 31 points included back-to-back 3-pointers late in the fourth quarter of the Detroit Pistons' 104-102 victory over the Orlando Magic. 
 The Pistons beat Orlando for the second time in six days in spite of the Magic's  J.J. Redick  and  E'Twaun Moore  tying their career scoring highs with 31 and 18 points, respectively. 
 Redick tied a Magic franchise record with five 3-pointers in the first quarter, but the Pistons still led 19-18 when Redick sat down with 4:21 left in the quarter. 
 The Magic were down 104-100 with 6.7 seconds left when Detroit's  Will Bynum  fouled  Jameer Nelson  on a 3-point shot. After making the first two free throws, he missed the third shot and the Magic had four attempts to tie the game on tips before the clock ran out. 
 
 Greg Monroe  had 17 points and seven rebounds for the Pistons, and  Charlie Villanueva  came off the bench with 12 points and five rebounds. 
 Bynum had seven of his season-high 12 assists in the fourth quarter. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "For the most part, Brandon was our savior tonight and Will was our savior at the start of the fourth." 
 
 -- Pistons forward  Tayshaun Prince 
 
 
 THE STAT:  In spite of Redick's 5-for-5 shooting from behind the arc in the first quarter and the Pistons making only 4-for-11 in the first half, Detroit finished with better 3-point shooting (11-for-23) than Orlando (10-for-23). 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Magic had erased a 13-point lead and led 98-95 with less than three minutes left. Villanueva missed a shot, but Prince got the rebound and set up Knight for another shot, which also missed. Monroe rebounded that shot and got it to Knight, who nailed a game-tying 3-pointer. Twelve seconds later, Knight nailed another 3-pointer and the Pistons were ahead to stay. 
 
 HOT:  Knight need only 16 shots to reach his career high of 31 points. He made 12, including 5-of-8 from 3-point range. 
 
 NOT: Glen Davis  shot 8-for-22 with five turnovers and also picked up a technical foul for the fourth straight game. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It's been messing up the flow of the game. I've got to grow up. And also it's costing me money." 
 
 -- Davis on his technical fou l 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Pistons loaded the floor with Monroe (6-foot-11), Villanueva (6-11), Prince (6-9) and  Austin Daye  (6-11) late in the first half against a Magic lineup that included Redick (6-4), Moore (6-4), Nelson (6-0) and  Arron Afflalo  (6-5), presenting impossible matchups for the Magic. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  With the Pistons up by four and trying to end the game, Bynum fouled Nelson on a long, desperation 3-pointer with 6.7 seconds left. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  The Magic are 0-3 since putting Redick in the starting lineup, but perhaps for the first time in his seven NBA seasons, he looked like the Duke edition of J.J. Redick. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "I assume that (Vaughn) has a plan with the rotation, and I didn't feel like I had cooled off or anything. If anything, I think I became less aggressive as the game wore on in terms of hunting my shot, and that's one thing I would change." 
 
 -- Redick, on being the first Magic starter taken out of the game with 4:21 left in the first quarter, having scored 16 points. 
 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  The Pistons got some offensive production from  Kim English  and  Kyle Singler , who were both assigned defensively to Redick. ... The Magic's  Maurice Harkless  had a dunk and five rebounds in 13 minutes.  
 
 NOTABLE:  Since Dec. 19, the Pistons are 10-6, the Magic are 2-16. ... The Magic had a 50-37 rebound advantage. ... There were 20 lead changes, 10 in the fourth quarter. ... Afflalo, who had another bad game against Detroit, didn't play in the fourth quarter because of "a slight left calf strain," according to Vaughn.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Pistons: Tuesday vs. Milwaukee, Wednesday @ Indiana, Friday vs. Cleveland. For the Magic: Monday @ Brooklyn, Wednesday @ New York, Friday @ Boston.
