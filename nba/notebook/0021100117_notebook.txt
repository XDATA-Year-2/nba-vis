  Notebook: Mavericks 96, Hornets 81   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Sunday January 8, 2012 12:34AM THE FACTS:  Paced by  Vince Carter  and  Ian Mahinmi  with 13 points apiece, six Mavericks scored in double figures in Saturday's 96-81 victory against the short-handed Hornets in Dallas.  Al-Farouq Aminu  had 15 points and 12 rebounds to lead New Orleans, which has lost six straight for the first time since March 2007. The Mavs have won 19 of the last 20 regular-season meetings at home against the Hornets. QUOTABLE:  "I just didn't think some of our guys competed tonight, and they didn't play. And we're not going to stand for that."   --New Orleans head coach  Monty Williams THE STAT:  Dallas had a 51-31 edge in bench points, with three reserves scoring in double figures: Mahinmi, Jason Terry (12) and Rodrigue Beaubois (11). In their four wins this season, the Mavericks have outscored their opponents' bench by an average of 26.0 points (207-103 total). TURNING POINT:  When the Mavericks' 3-pointers finally started falling, the Hornets couldn't keep up.  Brian Cardinal  knocked one down to start the second quarter, followed in short succession by two more from Beaubois as Dallas widened the gap. The Mavericks finished 8-for-19 (42.1 percent) from behind the arc after going 1-for-19 in Thursday's loss at San Antonio. HOT:  After shooting a season-low 35.1 percent Thursday against the Spurs, Dallas was 11-for-18 (61.1 percent) from the field in the first quarter against New Orleans. The Mavericks took the lead for good at 18-16 when  Lamar Odom  followed up his own miss with 4:06 left in the period. NOT:   Dirk Nowitzki  was 2-for-11 from the field. Coming off a six-point game against the Spurs, he was dangerously close to being held to single digits in back-to-back games for the first time since 2003. He converted a free throw with 3:02 remaining and finished with 10 points. GOOD MOVE:  With Jason Kidd missing the first of at least three games due to a lower-back injury, head coach  Rick Carlisle  shifted  Delonte West  from shooting guard to the point and started Carter at the two. Carter scored in double figures for the fourth time this season and West tallied 12 points, four assists, two steals and just one turnover. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Hornets point guard  Jarrett Jack  had 13 points on 4-for-14 shooting with seven rebounds and five assists. ROOKIE WATCH:  Hornets guard  Carldell Johnson , who entered the game with just one point in eight minutes this season, scored nine points in 17 minutes. He was 3-for-4 from downtown. NOTABLE:  Hornets center  Jason Smith  was not with the team due to a death in the family. Guard  Eric Gordon  (bruised right knee) and forward  Trevor Ariza  (groin strain) did not make the trip. ... The 2011 NBA champion Mavericks will visit  President Obama  at the White House on Monday. ... Dallas is 4-0 when leading at halftime. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Tuesday @ Detroit, Wednesday @ Boston, Friday vs. Milwaukee. For the Hornets, Monday @ Denver, Wednesday vs. Oklahoma City, Friday vs. Minnesota.
