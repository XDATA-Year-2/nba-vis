  Notebook: Hawks 109, Bulls 94   By Matt Winkeljohn, for NBA.com Posted Saturday January 7, 2012 10:40PM THE FACTS:  Eager to avenge Tuesday's dreadful loss Tuesday in Chicago, the Atlanta Hawks paid no mind to the fact that they were playing their third game in three nights -- including a triple-overtime loss Thursday to Miami and an overtime win Friday in Charlotte. They torched the visiting Bulls 109-94 Saturday night in a game that wasn't as close as the final score. Atlanta (6-3) started the game with a 12-1 burst and never looked back as  Josh Smith  scored a season-high 25 points,  Joe Johnson  added 17 and the Hawks' bench played big minutes as Chicago's six-game winning streak ended. Vladimir Radmanovic  replaced injured small forward  Marvin Williams  in the middle of the first quarter, and made all five of his three-pointers on the way to scoring 17 points. Atlanta made 9-of-12 treys, and the Hawks hit a season's-best 56.6 percent of their shots (47-of-83). They also registered a season-high 16 steals. Jeff Teague had five. Reserve point guard  John Lucas  led the Bulls (7-2) with 16 points as  Derrick Rose  sat out the final 14:29 because the game was so lopsided. Atlanta led by 17 points in the first quarter, by 18 at halftime, 29 in the third period and 27 in the fourth. Carlos Boozer  was the only Chicago starter to reach double figures, with 12 points. Rose and  Luol Deng  had eight each while  Joakim Noah  and  Ronnie Brewer  combined for four. QUOTABLE:  "When we played at Houston (a Dec. 31 loss), they were playing their third in three nights and they played with an enormous amount of energy . . . and tonight, we were very similar. Our guys came out from the very beginning and played with a lot of emotion. We played like a team that might have been playing on its first night. We just took it to them. For the most part, we started with energy, and never let up."  --  Hawks coach  Larry Drew . THE STAT:  54.1 percent. The Hawks won just about every metric, but the biggest disparity came on jumpers taken from outside the paint. They made 20-of-37 (54.1 percent), including 9-of-12 three pointers (missing two in garbage time). Chicago made 12-of-37 outside the paint (32.4 percent). TURNING POINT:  The opening tip. Noah won it, and pushed it toward Rose. He failed to go aggressively toward the ball, however, and Atlanta's Al Horford stole it, drove and scored a barely-contested layup with just seven seconds off the clock. Chicago never tied or led the game. QUOTABLE II:  "Our backs were against the wall, and we needed to get this win. We really gave everything we had out there, more than before."  --  Horford. HOT:  After making 5-of-7 shots, Radmanovic has made 9-of-14 in the past two games, including 7-of-9 treys. That comes on the heels of a four-game streak where he made just 1-of-18 shots. . . . Hawks reserve guard  Willie Green  has made 15-of-23 shots over the past four games while averaging 10 points. . . . . Atlanta's Smith scored 23 and 25 points on back-to-back nights. . . . With eight assists Saturday, Hawks point guard  Jeff Teague  has 24 in the past three games. . . . Chicago's  Kyle Korver  has made 8-of-12 three-pointers in the past two games. He made 3-of-5 Saturday. NOT:  Noah missed all four of his shots, and has made just 2-of-13 in Chicago's past two games. He played just 17:21 Saturday. . . . Rose made 3-of-10 shots, and over his past two games he's made 10-of-28. ROOKIE WATCH:  Chicago guard  Jimmy Butler  made all three of his shots, and all six of his free throws for a season- and career-high 12 points. That tripled his total for Chicago's first eight games combined. NOTABLE:  Hawks starting small forward Marvin Williams left the game after spraining his ankle with 6:03 left in the first quarter, and did not return. Drew did not offer much detail about the injury, but said that Radmanovic is likely to be playing in Williams' place. . . . Atlanta's  Jerry Stackhouse  played for the second time this season. The 16-year veteran missed his only shot and is 0-for-2 overall. . . . Atlanta hit season highs in field goals made (47), shooting percentage (56.6), steals (16). . . . The Hawks made just 14-of-25 free throws in a 76-74 loss Tuesday at Chicago. They made all six from the line Saturday. . . . The Hawks' 109 points were the most allowed by Chicago this season, eclipsing the 101 scored by the Clippers Dec. 30. . . . Before the Hawks made 9-of-12 three pointers, the most the Bulls allowed in a game this season was eight by Sacramento Dec. 29 in Chicago's only previous loss. UP NEXT:  For the Bulls, Monday vs. Pistons, Tuesday @ Timberwolves, Wednesday vs. Wizards. For the Hawks, Monday @ Nets, Wednesday @ Pacers, Thursday vs. Bobcats.
