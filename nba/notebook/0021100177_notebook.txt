  Notebook: Thunder 104, Knicks 92   By Randy Renner, for NBA.com Posted Sunday January 15, 2012 12:08AM THE FACTS:   Kevin Durant ,  Russell Westbrook  and  James Harden  blistered the New York Knicks with more than 20 points apiece and the Oklahoma City Thunder led by as many as 31 while cruising to a 104-92 win inside sold-out Chesapeake Energy Arena. Durant led all scorers with 28 points on 10-for-13 shooting, Harden had 24 on 8-for-12 (3-for-5 on 3-pointers) and Westbrook 21. Neither teams' starters played in the fourth quarter as both coaches emptied their benches. New York was led by a trio of players with 14 points.  Amar'e Stoudemire ,  Tyson Chandler  and  Toney Douglas . Chandler took only three shots but hit all of them and added eight free throws. Stoudemire had another tough shooting night going just 7-for-19. After winning four in a row the Knicks have now lost two straight while Oklahoma City runs its winning streak to six games and continues atop the Western Conference with only two losses in 13 games. QUOTABLE:  "We came out with a lot of energy on both ends of the floor. I thought our defense was the best it's been all year in the first half and that was the key. You don't go into the game thinking your starters won't have to play in the fourth quarter but it sure is nice."   --Thunder Head Coach  Scott Brooks THE STAT:  It was a rugged fourth quarter for the Thunder (17.6 percent shooting by the reserves and only 12 points) but it was what happened in the first three quarters that buried the Knicks. After the third quarter OKC led 92-65 on 57.4 percent shooting. The Thunder was 7-for-14 (50 percent) on 3-pointers and 23-for-25 (92 percent) at the free throw line. The Knicks were shooting just 38.1percent and 26.7 percent (4-for-15) on threes. TURNING POINT:  The Knicks had to play without forward  Carmelo Anthony,  who sprained his right ankle Thursday at Memphis. In 10 previous games against the Thunder (all as a Denver Nugget) Anthony averaged 30 points on 50 percent shooting. Without his fire power the Knicks could not keep up with the Thunder who led by 10 after one quarter and 23 at halftime. QUOTABLE II:  "They're a much different team with Carmelo. Anytime you lose one of your best players it's tough.   -- Brooks HOT:  Durant hit three of his first four shots...Durant finished the first half 7-for-9 (21 points) and finished 10-for-13 (28 points)...OKC guard Harden was 7-for-10 (19 points) in the first half...as a team in the first half Oklahoma City shot 58.1percent overall (25-for-41), 54.5 percent on 3-pointers (6-for-11) and 100 percent on free throws (14-for-14)... NOT:  Thunder point guard  Russell Westbrook  missed his first five shots...Knicks forward  Amar'e Stoudemire  was 4-for-12 (8 points) in the first half...In the fourth quarter Oklahoma City shot 17.6 percent (3-for-17)... INSIDE THE ARENA:  Former NBA star and Oklahoma City Thunder player  Desmond Mason  was at the game watching from court side seats. He now owns an art gallery in Oklahoma City. Oklahoma State University President  Burns Hargis  was also at the game. GOOD MOVE:  While Stoudemire stood at the top of the 3-point arc and looked to his right, Thunder point guard Westbrook ran in from his left, stole the ball, raced down court and slammed it home. BAD MOVE:  Thunder forward  Serge Ibaka  went to sleep for a moment on the defensive end early in the game letting New York center  Tyson Chandler  get behind and collect a pass from  Mike Bibby  for a slam. NOTABLE:  With 28 points,   Durant has now scored 10 or more points in 188 consecutive games. That is the second longest active streak in the NBA (LeBron James 356)...OKC's Ibaka blocked three shots against the Knicks extending his streak to 26 consecutive games with at least one block. That's the longest active streak in the league.  Kendrick Perkins  blocked two shots. Ibaka and Perkins have blocked at least one shot in every game this season. OKC is the only team in the NBA with two players having blocked a shot in every game... UP NEXT:  For the Knicks, Monday vs Magic, Wednesday vs Suns, Friday vs Bucks. For the Thunder, Monday @ Boston, Wednesday @ Washington, Saturday @ New Jersey.
