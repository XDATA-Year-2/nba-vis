 THE FACTS: J.R. Smith  tallied 25 points off the bench,  Amar'e Stoudemire  scored a season-high 21 and  Tyson Chandler  posted 11 points and 20 rebounds points as the Knicks blew out the Sacramento Kings 120-81 at Madison Square Garden. 
 The Knicks (30-15) are 15 games over .500 for the first time since April 13, 2001. They have now won four straight and five of six to move within a half game of the Miami Heat for the Eastern Conference's best record. 
 If the Heat lose Sunday at Toronto, Knicks coach  Mike Woodson  will coach the East in the All-Star Game.  Carmelo Anthony  and Chandler are both on the East squad, with Anthony named a starter. 
 
 DeMarcus Cousins  had 25 points and nine rebounds for the Kings (17-32), who have lost three straight and seven of eight. 
 New York avenged a buzzer-beating 106-105 loss at Sacramento Dec. 28. 
 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "You gotta have the mindset that you want to come in and dominate...You want to be a spark off the bench and that's what I came in to do tonight."  --  Stoudemire on MSG. 
 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Knicks tied their season-high by going 19-of-43 from beyond the arc, while the Kings made 6-of-21. For the Knicks, Smith went 7-of-14 from deep and  Steve Novak  was 5-of-7. Half of New York's 86 shot attempts were 3's. 
 
 THE STAT II:  Led by Smith, Stoudemire, Novak and  Kurt Thomas  (season-high 11 points), the Knicks' bench outscored the Kings' reserves, 82-38. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Knicks trailed by as many as 12 points in the first quarter but then rattled off a 50-15 sustained spurt to take the first half, 56-33. In the second quarter alone, New York outscored Sacramento, 31-11, and made 7-of-11 from beyond the arc. Novak was a perfect 4-of-4 from deep for 12 points in the second period. The Knicks then punished the Kings, 41-19, in the third period and led by as many as 50 points. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I'm not sitting here holding my breath thinking about coaching the All-Star team. I'm looking at the big picture and the big picture is trying to get this team to the Finals and try to win an NBA championship."  --  Woodson. 
 
 
 WHO'S HOT:  Stoudemire went 10-of-10 from the field, the most field goals without a miss this season by an NBA player and one shy of the Knicks' record for made field goals without a miss. In his last three games, he's gone 22-of-27. Entering this game, he was averaging 16 points and 5.6 rebounds in his last eight games. 
 
 WHO'S NOT:  The Kings' backcourt of  Tyreke Evans  and  Isaiah Thomas  went a combined 6-of-23 for 15 points and 10 assists. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "He's playing at a high level. He goes 10-for-10 and he's doing it inside and outside now. He's been great."  --  Woodson on Stoudemire. 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Anthony's franchise-record of 31 straight 20-point games came to an end as he finished with nine points on 4-of-12 shooting. 
 
 NOTABLE II:  Chandler notched back-to-back 20-rebound games. 
 
 QUOTABLE IV:  "There's not a team we can't beat in this league if we come committed to play for 48 minutes."  --  Woodson . 
 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  Twenty-some children from the Newtown (Conn.) Choir sang the national anthem.
