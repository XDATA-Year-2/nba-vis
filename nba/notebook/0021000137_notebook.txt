
 Warriors-Bucks notebook   By Rick Braun, for NBA.com Posted Sunday November 14, 2010 12:12AM THE FACTS:   John Salmons  took care of the offensive end with a game-high 26 points, and the other four Milwaukee starters posted double-digit rebounds as the Bucks survived a defensive struggle to down the Golden State Warriors, 79-72, Saturday night at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee. Exactly 52 weeks after the Bucks scored a 129-125 victory over the Warriors as  Brandon Jennings  scored 55, defense and rebounding were the keys as Milwaukee won for the third straight time and got back to .500 at 5-5. The Bucks shot a frigid 33.7% (28 for 83), but the Warriors (6-4), who were led by Monta Ellis' 24 points, were just as arctic with a 28-for-82 (34.1%) performance. QUOTABLE:  "That was a huge rebound for us, but we had tremendous play from a lot of people that stood out tonight.  Luc Mbah a Moute  did a great job on Monta Ellis and got some possessions back for us. We had 19 offensive rebounds."  --  Bucks forward  Drew Gooden,  whose offensive rebound of a Salmons miss led to a Salmons basket that gave the Bucks a 77-72 lead with 50 seconds left THE STAT:  The Bucks bench was almost a total non-factor, going 1 for 18, but four Milwaukee starters posted double figures in rebounds led by  Andrew Bogut 's 17. Mbah a Moute had 12, point guard Jennings had 11 and Gooden had 10, including six on the offensive glass. TURNING POINT:  The Bucks led from the first basket of the game, but the Warriors had trimmed an 18-point margin down to 75-72 on  Jeff Adrien's  short hook shot  with 1:31 left. Salmons missed from the right corner on Milwaukee's next possession, but Gooden went up between two Warriors to snare the offensive rebound. The ball eventually got back to Salmons, who hit a jumper in the lane for a 77-72 lead with 50.8 seconds left. The Warriors never threatened again. QUOTABLE II:  "There was a lot of defense being played on both ends. They had to lock down, too, on us. We made them play defense, and it made them a little tired. We missed a lot of shots, but they also missed a lot of shots."  --  Bucks guard  Brandon Jennings  on a night where the two teams combined to shoot 33.9% (56 for 165) HOT:  Salmons' 9-of-17 shooting that included 4 of 6 on 3-pointers qualified as red-hot on this night. Ellis was even better, going 9 for 16 and 4 of 5 on threes. NOT:  That would be just about everyone else other than Salmons and Ellis. Golden State's  Dorell Wright  went 2 for 14 and second-year guard  Stephen Curry  was 3 for 14. For the Bucks, the bench went 1 for 18, with ex-Warrior  Corey Maggette  going 1 for 6,  Ersan Ilyasova  going 0 for 6 and  Keyon Dooling  going 0 for 5. GOOD MOVE:  Starting Mbah a Moute seems to be a good move every time. Mbah a Moute started his third straight game in place of injured  Carlos Delfino  (strained neck), and the Bucks have won all three. Mbah a Moute also started a game in place of Bogut when the center suffered from a migraine headache, and the Bucks won that game. They're 4-0 when Mbah a Moute starts. ROOKIE WATCH:  Warriors forward  Jeff Adrien  posted six points and eight rebounds in just over 19 minutes of play. NOTABLE:  Almost a year to the date (Nov. 14 last year), the same teams met on the same court. This time the Bucks scored 50 fewer points and the Warriors scored 53 fewer points than the 129-125 thriller last year in which Jennings scored 55 -- the most in the NBA last season. ... With his 12th rebound of the night, Bogut passed Vin Baker for eighth on the team's all-time rebounding list with 3,080. Bogut finished the night with 17 rebounds to give him 3,085, and also matched a career-high with seven blocked shots. ... The Warriors were without forward  David Lee , who returned to the Bay Area and had surgery to clean out a laceration to his left elbow. UP NEXT:  For the Warriors, Monday vs. Detroit, Friday vs. New York, Sunday @ Los Angeles Lakers. For the Bucks, Tuesday vs. Los Angeles Lakers, Friday @ Philadelphia, Saturday vs. Oklahoma City.
