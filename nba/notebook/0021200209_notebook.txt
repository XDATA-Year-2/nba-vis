 THE FACTS :  Jordan Crawford  had 19 points,  Trevor Ariza  added 14 and  Kevin Seraphin  had 10 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Washington Wizards to their first win after a season-opening 12 losses, 84-82 over the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday night. 
 The Wizards opened up a 15-point lead early in the fourth quarter, but the Blazers (6-9) held Washington scoreless for nearly seven minutes as they went on a 16-0 run to take an 80-79 lead with 2:27 to play.  Emeka Okafor 's two free throws with 39.1 seconds left sealed it for the Wizards. 
 Portland, which has lost the first three of a season-long, seven-game road trip, was led by  Damian Lillard  and  Nicolas Batum  who each had 20.  LaMarcus Aldridge  had 17 and  J.J. Hickson  had 15 points and 19 rebounds. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "We don't want to go down in history as one of the worst teams ever." 
 -- Wizards forward  Chris Singleton  on Washington's win 
 
 THE STAT : The Wizards' bench outscored the Blazers' 46-4. 
 
 TURNING POINT : Washington withstood the 16-0 run after going scoreless for 6:47 in the fourth quarter.  
 
 QUOTABLE II  : "A loss is a loss, but this one definitely stings knowing the team is 0-12.  You never want to be the team they get the win on, but we were that team." 
 -- J.J. Hickson on being embarrassed by the loss 
 .   
 
 HOT : Ariza was 6-for-9 from the field as he helped the Wizards take a 68-59 lead after three quarters. 
 
 NOT :  The Blazers' bench combined to go 2-for-13 from the field. 
 
 GOOD MOVE : Washington coach  Randy Wittman  limited  Nene  to 19 minutes in his third game. He had six points. After Nene played 29 minutes in a double-overtime loss to Charlotte last Saturday, he missed Monday's game against San Antonio when his left foot injury, which cost him the first nine games of the season, flared up. 
 
 BAD MOVE : The Blazers' backcourt, Lillard and  Wesley Matthews , kept shooting. They combined to shoot 8-for-31.  
 
 NOTABLE : Nine teams started the season 0-13. Washington avoided being the 10th. 
 
 IN THE ARENA : The 14,114 fans who were in attendance were appreciative, but not overly loud about the Wizards' first win in seven months and two days.  
 
 NEXT : For Trail Blazers, Friday @ Celtics, Saturday @ Cavaliers, Monday @ Bobcats. For Wizards, Friday @ Knicks, Tuesday vs. Heat, Dec. 7 @ Hawks.
