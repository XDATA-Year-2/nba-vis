 THE FACT:  The Phoenix Suns, who never led in a loss Friday night at home vs. Dallas, never trailed in this game.  
 
 THE LEAD:  The Suns don't have the same end-of-year prospects as they did before star guard  Eric Bledsoe  went down with a knee injury. But they're still striving for the playoffs.  
 On Sunday night, the Suns, No. 8 in the West, gradually pulled away from the Denver Nuggets and rolled up a 117-103 win. 
 The win gives the Suns (23-17) a 3-0 record against the Nuggets (20-20 and now No. 10 in the West), which clinches the season series and gives the Suns the tie-breaker between the two teams.  
 
 Channing Frye  led the Suns with a season-high 30 points.  Markieff Morris , who has averaged 23.0 points vs. the Nuggets, added 16 off the bench. 
 For the Nuggets,  Anthony Randolph  scored a season-high 19 in a reserve role, while point guard  Ty Lawson  had 17 points and 14 assists. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I was trying to be as active as I could ... constant movement and taking shots I know I can make."  
 -- Channing Frye on his big game  
 
 
 THE STAT:  Nobody played 30 minutes for the Suns. Small forward  P.J. Tucker  got the most time with 29:27. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Suns, up only 91-86 early fourth quarter, went on a 10-2 run capped by a 3-pointer by  Marcus Morris , to take a decisive 101-88 lead with 6:45 lead. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "He gets up the floor pretty good for a big guy. What he's going to be good at is the pick-and-roll to the basket. To get a guy that big and that mobile is good to have. He's just getting started."  
 -- Suns coach  Jeff Hornacek  on rookie big man Alex Len 
 
 
 HOT:  Frye was 12-for-16, including 5-for-7 from 3-point land. He is the first Suns player to shoot 75 percent from the field (min. 15 attempts) while also making at least five 3-pointers since  Vince Carter  shot 13-for-17 including 5-for-7 on 3-pointers, on March 8, 2011. 
 
 NOT:  The Suns missed were 17-for-26 from the free throw line. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Hornacek was able to limit  Goran Dragic  to just 24 minutes. Dragic leads the team with 35.4 minutes per game and generally plays at a frenzied pace. Also, he has been dealing with a sore foot in recent games. 
 
 IN THE ARENA:  In his first home game since he returned to the Suns,  Leandro Barbosa  got an ovation from Suns fans. The Suns signed Barbosa, who had missed the past two games with a sore shoulder, to a second 10-day contract. He hadn't played a home game for the Suns in almost four years. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Len had his first significant impact in his uneventful rookie season. Len, the No. 5 overall pick in the draft, had nine points and six boards in 16 minutes. All are season highs. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:   Miles Plumlee , a rookie for practical purposes, may be hitting the wall. Plumlee, a major surprise for the Suns, played only 55 minutes last season, his first. Now, after playing more than 1,100 minutes this season, he has been sluggish the past two games. He put up only eight points and six rebounds and hasn't provided his usual effective interior defense in those two games. He averages 9.8 points and 8.8 boards. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Nuggets'  Darrell Arthur , called by coach  Brian Shaw  the team's best defender, missed his fourth straight game with a strained hip. Also,  Randy Foye  was a late scratch because of illness. ... The Suns have won 17 straight at home when scoring 110-plus points. ... In his first start this season, the Nuggets'  Evan Fournier  scored 17, his fourth game with 15-plus points in the last six games. ... This was the Suns' second wire-to-wire win; the first came at home Jan. 4 vs. Milwaukee. ... This was Frye's seventh 30-plus point game of his career. His career high is 33 points.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Nuggets, Thursday @ Portland, Saturday vs. Indiana, Sunday @ Sacramento. For the Suns, Wednesday vs. Indiana, Friday vs. Washington, Sunday @ Cleveland.
