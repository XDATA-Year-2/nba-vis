 THE FACTS: Jrue Holiday  tied his career high with 33 points and he also contributed 14 assists as the Philadelphia 76ers rallied from 19 points down in the second half to upend the Toronto Raptors 108-101 in overtime Friday night at the Wells Fargo Center. Holiday tied the game with 1.1 seconds left in regulation and then poured in all 12 of the Sixers' points in overtime.  Thaddeus Young  had 27 points and 14 rebounds, while  Lavoy Allen  and  Spencer Hawes  scored 12 points each for the Sixers (17-23). 
 
 Terrence Ross, Alan Anderson  and  Ed Davis  each scored 18 points for the Raptors (14-26), who fell to 4-17 on the road. Davis also swept 10 rebounds.  Jose Calderon  scored 13 points while  Kyle Lowry  had 11 points and 11 assists off the bench. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "At some point, you've got to have pride, even though we made it hard on ourselves." 
 -- Spencer Hawes 
 
 THE STAT : Over the past three games, the Sixers are averaging 104.7 points after averaging 87.3 points the previous eight games. 
 
 TURNING POINT : It was all Holiday in overtime. He dominated the game in every possible way and scored all 12 of his team's points. 
 
 HOT : Holiday was 13-for-23 from the field while Young was 13-for-19. The Sixers shot 51.9 percent -- 47-for-91. 
 
 NOT:  Anderson missed 11 of his 17 shots whole Lowry misfired on eight of his 11 shots. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "That was a gritty second half and overtime by our guys." 
 -- Sixers coach  Doug Collins  on overcoming a 19-point deficit 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT : Holiday had 33 points, 14 assists, five rebounds and three steals. Young also had a stellar game with 27 points, 14 rebounds, two assists and one blocked shot. For the Raptors, Davis had 18 points, 10 rebounds, six assists and two blocked shots. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA : There was a lively crowd of 16,574 for this game. Down the stretch and through overtime, the fans responded -- especially when the final buzzer sounded. 
 
 QUOTABLE III : "We've just got to sustain from the first half to the second half. We've got to play a full game." 
 -- Raptors guard  DeMar DeRozan 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE : The Sixers put the ball in Holiday's hands at the end of regulation and the entire overtime, and the young point guard continued to display his ever-improving ability to close out games. Holiday simply took over. 
 
 BAD MOVE : Toronto could have done more to get the ball away from Holiday in overtime. That didn't happen and the result was a tough road loss. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH : Ross had 18 points and seven rebounds, while forward  Quincy Acy  had four points and three rebounds. For the Sixers, forward  Arnett Moultrie  had a DNP-CD. 
 
 NOTABLE : The Raptors played with a depleted lineup. They were without forwards  Andrea Bargnani  (torn right elbow ligament) and  Linas Kleiza  (sore right knee) along with center  Jonas Valanciunas  (fractured metacarpal, right ring finger). ... After allowing the New Orleans Hornets to shoot 16-for-21 in the first quarter last Tuesday, the Sixers couldn't stop the Raptors in the first quarter. The Raptors were 12-for-17 -- 71 percent. ... The Sixers are 2-1 in overtime this season. ... Toronto hit 11 shots from beyond the arc. The Sixers are now 2-9 when allowing 10 or more made 3-pointers. ... Holiday has scored 29 or more points in each of the last three games. That's the longest streak by a Philadelphia player since  Allen Iverson  accomplished the feat from Nov. 18-Dec. 2, 2006. Dating to 1985-86, only two Sixers have posted at least 33 points and 14 assists in the same game --  Charles Barkley  at Indiana on Nov. 4, 1986 and Iverson against Miami on April 14, 2005 and against Orlando on Jan. 26, 2006. ... Young earned his sixth double-double over the past 14 games. 
 
 NEXT : For the Raptors, Sunday vs. L.A. Lakers, Wednesday @ Miami, Thursday @ Orlando. For the Sixers, Monday vs. San Antonio, Tuesday @ Milwaukee, Saturday vs. New York.
