 THE FACTS:  The streak continues. 
 
 LeBron James  scored 27 points,  Dwyane Wade  added 21 points and the   Miami Heat   won their 20th consecutive game with a hard-fought 98-94 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday night.  Ray Allen  contributed 12 points while  Chris Bosh  and  Chris Andersen  had 10 each. The Heat's 20-game winning streak is tied for the third-longest in NBA history. The Lakers won 33 in a row in 1971-72, the Houston Rockets won 22 straight in 2007-08 while the Milwaukee Bucks (1970-71) and Washington Capitols (1948) also won 20 straight. The Heat improved to 49-14 and 19-11 on the road. 
 
 Thaddeus Young  led the Sixers with 24 points and 15 rebounds.  Jrue Holiday  had 21,  Evan Turner  15 and  Dorell Wright  13. The Sixers fell to 24-40 and 18-17 at home. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It certainly was not pretty, not necessarily the way we scripted it down the stretch. But we gutted it out." 
 -- Heat coach  Erik Spoelstra 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Sixers are 5-16 when the opponent records 25 or more assists. The Heat had exactly 25. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  After Holiday tied the game at 91 with 1:20 remaining, the Heat responded by closing out the game on a 7-3 run. James hit 1-of-2 free throws, Wade had a huge basket and the Heat were able to pull away from the feisty Sixers. 
 
 HOT:  Wade was 7-for-14 and Anderson was 5-9. Young knocked down 11 of his 20 shots for the Sixers. 
 
 NOT: Shane Battier  was 2-for-6 while Philadelphia's  Royal Ivey  struggled by missing all three of his shots. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We just don't panic. Our main goal is to win a game not to blow a team out. Whatever the case may be, we just want to play the game. Wherever the game takes us in those 48 minutes, we're ready for it." 
 -- James 
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  James was stellar once again with 27 points, eight assists, seven rebounds, two steals and one blocked shot. Holiday had a strong game as well, going for 21 points, seven assists, seven rebounds, three steals and one blocked shot. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  From the opening tip to the final buzzer, the sellout crowd of 20,398 was buzzing inside the Wells Fargo Center. Down the stretch, the fans inside the arena were as loud as they have been all season. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "I don't think there was any pressure on us. Those guys were on the streak and we were trying to end it." 
 -- Young 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Heat struggled with their shooting at times as evidenced by a 5-for-20 effort from beyond the arc. They stayed aggressive and kept attacking the basket in the waning minutes and it paid off in another victory. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  There wasn't much more the Sixers could have done on this night. They got the shots they wanted at the end. It just wasn't enough against the hottest team in the league. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Heat forward  Jarvis Varnado  was inactive. For the Sixers, forward  Arnett Moultrie  was scoreless in 5:21. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Heat have won 14 consecutive regular season games against the Sixers. ... The Sixers have lost 13 of their last 15 games. ... Young registered his third straight double-double and his 18th of the season after compiling just one all of last season. Young also had 16 points in the third quarter, the most in any quarter by a Sixer this season. ... Holiday has scored 20 or more points 24 times this season after accomplishing the feat 10 times last season. ... James is averaging 22.7 points, nine rebounds and eight assists in three games against the Sixers this season. ... The Heat are an NBA-best 13-0 since the All-Star break. ... The Heat have dished out at least 20 assists in 15 straight games, their longest streak since doing it in 16 consecutive games from Dec. 3, 2004-Jan. 1, 2005. ... Wade had three assists, leaving him 14 shy of 4,000 for his career.
