 THE FACTS : The Toronto Raptors didn't do it easily, but defeated the Charlotte Bobcats 92-78 for a much needed win at Air Canada Centre Friday night.  Rudy Gay  led the Raptors with 28 points on 11-for-16 shooting and  Amir Johnson  added 12 points and a career-high 21 rebounds.  
 The Bobcats shot a dismal 31 percent from the field in the first half, yet were strong on the offensive boards with 12. The Raptors (26-40) pulled down 17 rebounds total and a 48-41 lead into halftime. However, the Bobcats (14-51) went on a 22-9 run in the third, behind 11 of  Gerald Henderson's  22 points, to bring the score within one point, making it 69-68 at the end of the third quarter.  
 The Raptors dug in defensively and held the Bobcats to their only field goal of the fourth quarter with 3:03 left, outscoring them 23-10 in the frame decidedly taking the win. Charlotte was led by Henderson, while  Kemba Walker  added 20 points,  Josh McRoberts  added 10 points and nine rebounds. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "That is my challenge as a team. You showed that you can get down, get grimy, and get dirty. That is the way we want to play, but we cannot spot a team that many possessions and expect to come out on top." 
 -- Raptors coach  Dwane Casey  on his team's stingy fourth quarter 
 
 THE STAT : The Bobcats shot 1-for-13, (7.7 percent) from the field in the fourth. They only trailed one point entering the final quarter. 
 
 TURNING POINT : The fourth quarter started 69-68 in favor of the Raptors and they instantly went on a 15-4 run, effectively putting a nail in the coffin for Charlotte. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "The ball was finding me in certain spots and I was able to get position and get the rebounds." 
 -- Raptors forward Amir Johnson on his career-high rebounding game 
 
 HOT : Gay was sterling in the first half shooting 6-for-7 from the floor for 14 points, two rebounds and two assists in 17 minutes. He finished the game with 28 points on 11-for-16 shooting from the field while going 5-for-5 from the line. 
 
 NOT:  Henderson came off a career-high 35-point game against Boston, but was slow to get on track shooting 2-for-9 from the field for seven points in the first half.  
 
 GOOD MOVE : Team defense helped the Raptors hold the Bobcats to one field goal in the fourth quarter on 1-for-13 shooting. 
 
 NOTABLE : The season series between the Raptors and Bobcats is now at 2-1, both teams meet next Wednesday for the season-closer. ... Johnson set a career-high with 21 rebounds, the last Raptor with over 20 rebounds was  Joey Dorsey , April 11, 2011.  
 
 UP NEXT : For the Raptors, Sunday vs. Miami, Wednesday @ Charlotte, Friday vs. New York. For the Bobcats, Saturday @ Boston, Wednesday vs. Orlando and Friday vs. Indiana.
