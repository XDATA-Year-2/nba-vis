 THE FACTS : The Milwaukee Bucks put an end to a nine-game losing streak against the Chicago Bulls in remarkable fashion, erasing a 27-point third quarter deficit to pull out a 93-92 victory Monday night at the United Center. The Bulls led 78-51 with 2:50 left in the third quarter, but scored just 14 points in the game's final 15 minutes.  Ersan Ilyasova , removed from the starting lineup for rookie  John Henson  in the game, led all Bucks (7-5) with a season-high 18 points off the bench.  Rip Hamilton  led the Bulls with 30 points, his season high.  
 The Bulls (6-7) led 50-40 at halftime, then hit five 3-pointers in the third quarter to send the lead to 27 points. The Bulls made 5 of their last 22 shots from that point to the end of the game.    
 
 QUOTABLE : "You just walk the game down to 18, to 16, to 12, to eight -- which is what we did."  
 -- Milwaukee coach  Scott Skiles 
 
 
 THE STAT : Skiles put Henson in the starting lineup, and returned  Samuel Dalembert  to the starting five after an unofficial one-game benching. But it was the Bucks bench that provided 56 points to just 10 for the Bulls' second strings. Besides Ilyasova,  Ekpe Odoh  and  Beno Udrih  each scored 11 points.  
 
 TURNING POINT : Down 80-57 with 1:30 left in the third quarter, the Bucks scored the last six points of the period, including a buzzer-beater by Udoh to cut the Bulls lead to 17 points. Milwaukee then scored the first 13 points of the fourth quarter, completing a 19-0 run. 
 
 REMEMBER WHEN : For Bulls fans, the game brought back memories of the worst loss of the  Vinny Del Negro  coaching era, when his Bulls let the Sacramento Kings come back from 35 points down to record a 102-98 victory Dec. 21, 2009. Del Negro was roundly criticized for that loss.  
 
 INJURY UPDATE : After spraining his ankle at the end of Saturday's game in Milwaukee, Bucks starting guard  Brandon Jennings  played 26 minutes Monday and scored six points on 2-for-9 shooting. 
 
 HOT : Through three quarters, Hamilton was 10-for-16 from the field. He went 2-for-8 in the fourth quarter, however.  
 
 QUOTABLE II : "The key thing is 48 minutes. If you don't play hard with the lead, this is what happens."  
 -- Bulls coach  Tom Thibodeau 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE : Skiles said before the game that moving Ilyasova out of the starting lineup might spark him. It worked, as Ilyasova went 8-for-14 from the field and got six rebounds.  
 
 QUOTABLE III : "They scored more than us.'' 
  -- Bulls forward  Luol Deng 
 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA : On a cold Monday night when very little buzz could be felt in the United Center, famed Chicago sports fans Jenny McCarthy and Jim Belushi were in attendance.  
 
 ROOKIE WATCH : Henson scored 11 points in just under 15 minutes in his first career pro start for Milwaukee.   
 
 NOTABLE : The Bulls were called for a delay of game infraction for failing to get onto the court in a timely fashion for the opening tip. ... The last Milwaukee win over the Bulls was April 10, 2010. ... The Bucks had 10 blocked shots against the Bulls in the loss at Milwaukee Saturday night, and followed that with a 12-block game Monday. Udoh had five blocks. ... Bulls forward Carlos Boozer had 19 points and 11 rebounds for his fifth double-double in the last six games.   
 
 UP NEXT : For the Bulls, Wednesday vs. Mavericks, Saturday vs. Sixers, Tuesday vs. Pacers. For the Bucks, Wednesday vs. Knicks, Friday @ Timberwolves, Saturday vs. Celtics.
