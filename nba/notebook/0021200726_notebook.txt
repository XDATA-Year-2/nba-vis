 THE FACTS:   The Miami Heat defeated the Houston Rockets 114-108 Wednesday at AmericanAirlines Arena.  
 The Heat received big games from forward  LeBron James  and guard  Dwyane Wade , who combined to score 63 points. The duo shot 20-for-36 from the field, helping Miami to its third straight victory.  
 The Heat led by as many as 17 in the second half before holding off a late Rockets run. Houston closed to within three, 104-101, with 2:29 left less than four minutes remaining. The rally was stopped on the next possession when  Shane Battier  hit a 3-pointer from the corner. The key play late came when  Mario Chalmers  drew a charge on  James Harden  with the Rockets trailing by three.  
 Harden led the Rockets with 36 points.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We held them to 108 [points]. That team can score. Even when we had an opportunity in the second half to get a double-digit lead, they came right back. That's what they do."  
 -- Heat coach  Erik Spoelstra 
 
 
 THE STAT:   Despite being undersized, the Heat were able hold their own on the boards.  Udonis Haslem  finished with a game-high 13 rebounds.  
 
  TURNING POINT:  Trailing 50-43, the Heat went on a 12-0 run late in the second quarter. Miami never trailed again.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We had some breakaways and some shots we could have gotten in, but we just didn't make the plays."  
 -- Rockets coach  Kevin McHale 
 
 
 HOT:  James continues to score with efficiency. He shot a high clip for the second straight game, and has made 60 percent of his field goal attempts in the last 12 games.  
 
 NOT:  It was an off shooting night for Rockets guard  Jeremy Lin , who continues to struggle when facing the Heat. Lin was just 3-for-10 from the field. He finished with 13 points, but the bulk of his scoring came at the free-throw line.  
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Heat went to James and Wade early and often. The duo has their way in the paint and on the perimeter. James started by making 11 of his first 15 shots while Wade started the game 7-for-12.  
 
 BAD MOVE:  After tying the NBA record with 23 3-pointers the night before, the Rockets weren't as successful from the arc. They finished just 9-for-25 from the 3-point line.  
 
  NOTABLE:  Heat center  Chris Bosh  did not play because of the flu. He is expected to be ready for Friday's game against the Clippers ... The Heat improved to 20-3 at home.  
 
  UP NEXT:  For the Heat, Friday vs. L.A. Clippers, Sunday vs. L.A. Lakers, Tuesday vs. Portland. For the Rockets, Friday vs. Portland, Sunday @ Sacramento, Tuesday @ Golden State.
