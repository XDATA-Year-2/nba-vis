  Raptors-Clippers notebook   By Dan Arritt, for NBA.com Posted Sunday March 27, 2011 2:58AM THE FACTS:  The Los Angeles Clippers rallied from a 10-point deficit with just over eight minutes remaining Saturday night to defeat the road-challenged Toronto Raptors, 94-90, at Staples Center. QUOTABLE:  "It was our defense. We got stops. We went out in transition and in the half-court and we made plays."   -- Clippers rookie forward  Blake Griffin THE STAT:  The Clippers collected a season-high 64 rebounds, led by Griffin with 16 and  Chris Kaman  with 12. Their previous season high was 57 against Denver on Jan. 5 TURNING POINT:  Toronto went ahead 80-70 on a free throw by  Leandro Barbosa  after the Clippers were whistled for illegal defense, but then missed 14 of its final 18 field-goal attempts. An 11-0 run put the Clippers ahead for good, 85-82, with 3:15 remaining. QUOTABLE II:  "We're not moving the ball that well. That comes with experience and we have to be better, and I will take the responsibility for that."   -- Raptors coach Jay Triano HOT:  Toronto rookie forward  Ed Davis  established a season-high for the second straight night. Davis scored 21 points on 8-for-11 shooting, 24 hours after scoring 18 in a 138-100 loss at Golden State. NOT:  After trailing by as many as 47 points in the blowout loss Friday night at Golden State, the Raptors thought they were closing in on road win No. 7 this season but instead ended up with road loss No. 31. GOOD MOVE:  Kaman has won back his starting center job after  DeAndre Jordan  went down with pneumonia last week and he seems intent to hold on to it. His offensive rebound and ensuing dunk off a Griffin miss capped the deciding 11-0 run. BAD MOVE:  Toronto center  Andrea Bargnani  was not on the list of game-time decisions for the Raptors, but the team's leading scorer ended up sitting out with born spurs in his right ankle. ROOKIE WATCH:  In addition to his team-high 16 rebounds, Griffin scored a team-high 22 points for just his second double-double in the last 10 games. NOTABLE:  The Clippers matched their win total from last season, when they finished 29-53. With one more victory, they will have their best season since 2006-07.     UP NEXT:  For the Clippers, Wednesday vs. Dallas, Friday @ Phoenix, Saturday vs. Oklahoma City. For the Raptors, Wednesday vs. Milwaukee, Saturday @ Chicago, April 3 vs. Orlando.
