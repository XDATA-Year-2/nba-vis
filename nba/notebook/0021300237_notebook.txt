 THE FACT:  The Pelicans registered their third straight win over the 76ers, their longest streak since a four-game stretch between Nov. 11, 2007-March 2, 2009. 
 
 THE LEAD:   Eric Gordon  led five players in double figures as the New Orleans Pelicans cruised past the Philadelphia 76ers 121-105 Friday night at the Wells Fargo Center. Gordon scored 26 points and  Anthony Davis  added 22 points and 10 rebounds. Guard  Jrue Holiday , who was an All-Star last season with the Sixers, nearly had a triple-double consisting of 20 points, 13 assists and seven rebounds.  Ryan Anderson  scored 18 points and  Tyreke Evans  added 16. The Pelicans snapped a two-game losing streak and improved to 7-8. 
 
 Tony Wroten  scored a career-best 24 points for the Sixers while  Evan Turner  had 22, his 13th game this season with at least 20.  Thaddeus Young  added 15 points and 12 rebounds,  Spencer Hawes  scored 12 points and rookie point guard  Michael Carter-Williams  contributed 10 points and 10 assists. It was the third loss in a row for the Sixers, who fell to 6-11. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It's always good to get a win on the road in this league. Coming here tonight against the Sixers was nice. But truthfully, I'm just happy to get the win." 
 -- Holiday 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Sixers shot just 9-for-21 from the free throw line and committed 19 costly turnovers. It's difficult to win games with numbers like those. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Pelicans led 61-55 at halftime and pushed it to 10 after the third quarter. They never let up and wouldn't let the Sixers make any kind of late run on this night. 
 
 HOT:  Gordon knocked down 11 of his 16 shots while Davis was 11-for-20 after starting 0-for-6. Holiday was 8-for-13 and Evans hit six of his 10 shots. The Pelicans shot a sizzling 55 percent overall. For the Sixers, Wroten was 9-for-13 and Turner was 9-for-15. 
 
 NOT:  Carter-Williams missed nine of his 13 shots and three of his four free throws.  James Anderson  was 3-for-9. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Pelicans did an excellent job of moving the ball from side to side as well as going inside out. They didn't force anything and continually got open looks all night. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Sixers didn't challenge the New Orleans shooters nearly enough and that backfired.  
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  There was an energetic crowd of 17,807 at the Wells Fargo Center for this matchup the day after Thanksgiving. Holiday received a huge ovation during pregame introductions. Philadelphia Eagles long snapper  Jon Dorenbos  attended the game. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We're not even 20 games in yet, so you can't really get too up and down emotionally. You just have to find a way to figure it out and keep working." 
 -- Turner 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Young returned to the Sixers' starting lineup after coming off the bench Wednesday at Orlando. Young had missed the previous three games for personal reasons. ... New Orleans outscored the Sixers 60-52 in points in the paint. The Sixers have been outscored in points in the paint in each of the past three games. ... Wroten reached at least 20 points for the second time this season. As a rookie for Memphis last season, he reached double figures just once (11 points) in 35 games played. ... Holiday has four double-doubles this season. ... New Orleans won for the second time on the road. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "We had 30 assists, but I thought we could have had 35 or 40 assists tonight. We just have to learn how to play together consistently." 
 -- Pelicans coach  Monty Williams 
 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Pelicans, Sunday @ New York, Monday @ Chicago, Wednesday vs. Dallas. For the Sixers, Sunday @ Detroit, Tuesday vs. Orlando, Friday @ Charlotte.
