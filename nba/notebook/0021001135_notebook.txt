  Sixers-Bucks notebook   By Rick Braun, for NBA.com Posted Sunday April 3, 2011 12:06AM THE FACTS: John Salmons  scored 19 points, including two clinching free throws with 13.9 seconds in overtime, and added eight assists, and  Brandon Jennings  scored nine of his 13 points in the extra period to lead the Milwaukee Bucks to a 93-87 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers Saturday night at the Bradley Center. QUOTABLE:  "Yeah it is (nice to win a close game) but it's a little too late. We still have a little bit of heartbeat for the playoffs, but if this was a couple weeks ago it would be nice."  --  Bucks center  Andrew Bogut. THE STAT:  How much trouble are the Bucks having down the stretch of games? They missed their last six shots of regulation in this one but were able to win in overtime. On Monday they missed their last 11 shots in an 87-86 loss in which Charlotte scored the last seven points, and last Saturday they missed their last six shots as Chicago finished on a 12-0 run to win 95-87. TURNING POINT:  A short hook by Bogut snapped a streak of six straight misses for the Bucks and tied it at 81 early in overtime, and Brandon Jennings' 3-pointer with 3:04 left gave the Bucks the lead for good at 84-81. Twice the Sixers got back within one, but they never got back to even. QUOTABLE II:  "We've had problems pretty much all year closing games out. But I think it all goes back to the offensive end. All year we've struggled on the offensive end, and that just continues down the stretch of ballgames."  --  Salmons. HOT:  Salmons made 8 of 11 shots from the field, including his only 3-pointer. NOT:  After making 13 of their first 20 shots ending with their first shot of the second quarter, the Sixers made just 22 of their last 67. GOOD MOVE:  Whatever Bucks coach  Scott Skiles  said in the locker room at halftime had a strong effect as the Bucks forced Philadelphia to miss its first 10 shots of the third quarter. ROOKIE WATCH:  Bucks forward  Larry Sanders  played just 10 minutes and 30 seconds but had two blocked shots. NOTABLE:  Sixers guard  Jodie Meeks , a second-round pick by the Bucks in the 2009 draft, went 5 for 5, including two 3-pointers, in the first half for 13 points. He didn't score again... After scoring 30 in the first 12 minutes, the Sixers scored just 57 over the next 41 minutes...Sixers guard  Lou Williams  left with a hamstring strain and did not return... After  Drew Gooden's  jumper gave the Bucks a 78-73 lead with 5:03 left, the Bucks missed their last six field goal attempts of regulation and scored just one more point until overtime...Gooden, playing in his fourth game after missing 30 straight with plantar fasciitis, had a double-double with 12 points and 12 rebounds. ...  Elton Brand  had a double-double for the Sixers with 20 points and 12 rebounds, and  Jrue Holiday  had 15 points and 10 assists...The loss leaves the Sixers (40-37) just one game ahead of New York (37-38) in the loss column for the sixth playoff spot. The two teams meet in New York on Wednesday. UP NEXT:  For the 76ers, Tuesday @ Boston, Wednesday @ New York, Friday vs. Toronto. For the Bucks, Tuesday @ Orlando, Wednesday @ Miami, Friday @ Detroit.
