  Lakers-Knicks notebook   By Adam Zagoria, for NBA.com Posted Friday February 11, 2011 11:46PM THE FACTS:   Kobe Bryant  scored a game-high 33 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in just 29 minutes as the Los Angeles Lakers improved to a perfect 4-0 on their road trip with a 113-96 win over the Knicks at Madison Square Garden.  Pau Gasol  added 20 points for the Lakers, who are in the midst of a seven-game road swing. QUOTABLE:  "I wanted to come out and play a good floor game. But they jumped on us early, they got momentum early. So I tried to see if I could get something going, tried to get the momentum back."    -- Kobe Bryant THE STAT:  Led by  Lamar Odom 's 14 points and  Shannon Brown 's 12, the Lakers' bench outscored the Knicks' bench 44-25. TURNING POINT:  The Lakers outscored the Knicks 32-20 in the second period behind Gasol's 12 points to take a 62-48 halftime lead. QUOTABLE II:  "Kobe kind of took our heart there a little bit. He made some tough shots, especially in the first quarter."    -- Knicks coach  Mike D'Antoni HOT:  After scoring 20 points in the second half of Thursday's 92-86 win at Boston, Bryant picked right up where he left off, scoring 19 points and grabbing six rebounds in the first quarter. By the half, Kobe had 23 and eight. He added 10 points in part of the third before sitting down for the rest of the night. NOT:  The Knicks dropped to 26-26 on the season and suffered their 11th defeat in their last 15 games. They remain in sixth place in the Eastern Conference, but are closer to ninth place than fifth. If they lose at the Nets Saturday, they will fall under .500 for the first time since Nov. 27. NOTABLE:   Amar'e Stoudemire  (24 points, 10 rebounds) picked up his 14th technical foul of the season with 1:54 remaining in the third. Two more and he gets an automatic one-game suspension. Every two after that yields another one-game suspension. INSIDE THE ARENA:   Rex Ryan ,  Justin Tuck ,  C.C. Sabathia ,  Kanye West ,  Jeremy Piven ,  Anna Wintour  and  Spike Lee  sat courtside. Wearing a  Walt Frazier  throwback jersey, Ryan promised the Jets would win the Super Bowl in 2012: "Last year I thought we'd win it, this year I know we'll win it." UP NEXT:  For the Knicks, Saturday @ Nets, Wednesday vs. Atlanta, Feb. 23 vs. Milwaukee. For the Lakers, Sunday @ Orlando, Monday @ Charlotte, Wednesday @ Cleveland.
