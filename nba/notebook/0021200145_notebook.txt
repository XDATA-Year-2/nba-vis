THE FACTS: Wesley Matthews  and  Nicolas Batum  each scored 21 points, while  LaMarcus Aldridge  collected 18 points and a team-high 13 rebounds as Portland (5-5) won its third straight game. The Blazers led 64-49 midway through the third quarter but Chicago rallied to draw even at 73-73. 
The Blazers responded with an 8-0 run and were in front 87-75 before the Bulls snipped the margin to 88-81 with 3:32 remaining. Matthews scored five in a row to make it a 93-81 lead, but Chicago wasn't done, getting to within 98-94 with 13.9 seconds to go. 
 Joakim Noah  filled up the box score with team highs in points (16), rebounds (15)  and assists (8) for Chicago (5-5), which lost for second straight night. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "He just busts out. He has a lot of confidence in taking those shots. When he is on a roll, it's impressive. He can throw nine points up pretty quick."  
 -- Blazers coach  Terry Stotts  on Batum 
 
 THE STAT:  Batum, who entered the game second in the league in 3-pointers made with 26, was 5-for-10 in Sunday's game. He becomes the first Blazers player to make at least 30 treys in his first 10 games of a season since Cliff Robinson in 1995. 
 
 
TURNING POINT : After Chicago tied the game at 73-73 early in the fourth quarter, the Blazers went on a 14-2 that gave them just enough cushion to win. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We gave ourselves a chance, but we dug such a big hole that it was too much to get out of. The defense, the rebounding, the turnovers ... we have to get that part right."  
 -- Chicago coach  Tom Thibodeau 
 
 
 HOT:  Batum sank three 3-pointers in a span of five minutes to start the third quarter and stake Portland to a 15-point lead. 
 
 NOT:  Chicago's  Carlos Boozer  seemed out of it. The veteran power forward was 2-for-8 from the field and finished with four points and three rebounds in 22 minutes. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  With Aldridge lighting Chicago up for 15 first-half points, the Bulls went to Noah to guard him at halftime. Portland's All-Star power forward managed only three points in the second half. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  With Portland ahead 100-94 in the closing seconds,  Damian Lillard  wound up with the ball in front court. The rookie point guard went in and dunked the ball with no Chicago defenders around -- an unwritten no-no when the outcome is decided and fewer than 24 seconds remain.  
 
 QUOTABLE III : "When I got the ball, I didn't know what to do, honestly. I didn't mean no disrespect to [the Bulls]. Now, I know to just dribble the ball out." 
 --Damian Lillard on the final basket
 
 
 QUOTABLE IIII:  "Those two guys have stayed in the league for a long time doing what they do. Ronnie played his best game of the season. Jared is a solid player who does all the little things that go unnoticed  -- or at least, they're not in the box score." 
 -- Terry Stotts on Portland reserves  Ronnie Price  and  Jared Jeffries 
 
 
 NOTABLE:   Lillard, who scored 16 points for Portland, is averaging 19.0 points and 6.1 assists in his rookie season. He is the first NBA player to average at least 19 points and six assists in his first 10 career games since Detroit's Isiah Thomas in 1981. 
 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Bulls: Tuesday @ Houston, Friday @ Milwaukee, Sunday vs. Chicago.  For the Trail Blazers: Wednesday at Phoenix, Friday vs. Minnesota, Sunday @ Brooklyn.
