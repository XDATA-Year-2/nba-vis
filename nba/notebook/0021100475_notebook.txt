  Notebook: Thunder 101, Nuggets 93 Posted Tuesday February 21, 2012 12:13AM By Randy Renner, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  The Oklahoma City Thunder used another big night from its two All-Stars to secure a 101-93 win over the visiting New Orleans Hornets but it wasn't as easy as it appeared it would be early in the third quarter. OKC was coming off an intense, overtime win over the Denver Nuggets on Sunday night and by the time the Thunder had rolled up a 26 point lead with eight minutes left in the third quarter it looked like they were ready to put it on cruise control. But the Hornets weren't ready to call it a night and they outplayed and outscored Oklahoma City for the rest of the game and very nearly came all the way back cutting the margin down to six with just over a minute to go but the Thunder held on for the win. Kevin Durant  and  Russell Westbrook  each had 31 points to lead the Thunder. No one else in the lineup scored in double figures, but  Kendrick Perkins  and  Serge Ibaka  each pulled down 13 rebounds. Perkins also blocked six shots and Ibaka swatted away three. The Hornets spread out the scoring with five players in double digits led by  Jarrett Jack's  18.  Grievis Vasquez  added 15 and  Al-Farouq Aminu  dropped in 14. Center  Chris Kaman  was hounded by Perkins all night and managed 12 points on just 4-for-17 shooting. Both teams are struggling with injuries and each was without five players. The Thunder continues with the best record in the Western Conference at 25-7 while the Hornets sit at the opposite end with a 7-24 mark. QUOTABLE:  "I thought we came out with great energy to start the game and that was a concern after last night. Serge (Ibaka) and Perk (Kendrick Perkins) really protected the paint. This is a no excuse league, yeah we have some guys who are out but we have enough to play."   --Thunder Head Coach  Scott Brooks THE STAT:  Durant and Westbrook shot a combined 20-for-39 scoring 62 points. The rest of the lineup was just 16-for-41. The Thunder defense again came up big limiting New Orleans to just 28.6 percent shooting in the first half and 36.3 percent for the game. QUOTABLE II:  "Perk was one of the bright spots for us, he set the tone on defense and didn't give (Chris) Kaman any good looks."   -- Brooks TURNING POINT:  A big first half for the Thunder (60 points) and an 8-4 start to the third quarter produced a 26 point lead which was just too much for the shorthanded Hornets to overcome. QUOTABLE III:  "As we always do we hung in there. It's tough when you play against a team like the Thunder who has a lot of rhythm. I felt our guys kind of hung their heads a little in the first half but I never feel like I'm out of it, but it's hard to inject that into other people."   -- Hornets Head Coach  Monty Williams HOT:  Oklahoma City finished the first quarter shooting 60.9 percent (14-for-23)...OKC was 24-for-43 (55.8 percent) in the first half... Kevin Durant  was 6-for-9 (19 points) and  Russell Westbrook  was 7-for-12 (15 points) in the first half...Hornets guard  Greivis Vasquez  was 5-for-6 in the third quarter... Jarrett Jack  was 5-for-8 in the fourth. NOT:  The Hornets were just 5-for-15 (33.3 percent) in the first nine minutes of the game and were just 1-for-6 (16.6 percent) on shots taken from inside the paint. ... Hornets center  Chris Kaman  was 1-for-8 in the first quarter. ... New Orleans managed just 28.6 percent shooting (12-for-42) in the first half. ... Hornets guard Jack was 1-for-6 in the first 24 minutes. ...Thunder guard  Daequan Cook  was 1-for-4 on 3-pointers in the first half and finished 1-for-9 on threes and 3-for-13 overall. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Another sell-out inside Chesapeake Energy Arena. The Thunder has sold-out all 14 of their home games at "The Peake" this season and 28 consecutive regular season games. GOOD MOVE:  A moment after the Thunder turns the ball over in the second quarter OKC's Durant intercepts an outlet pass from Hornets forward  Gustavo Ayon , then drives into the lane where the New Orleans defenders fail to challenge him. Durant then goes up for an uncontested slam. NOTABLE:  The Thunder is now 13-1 at home including 10 straight W's. That's the most consecutive home wins for the franchise since the 1997-98 season when the then Seattle SuperSonics won 12 in a row. ...This was the 37th time Durant and Westbrook have scored 25 or more points in the same game. No other duo in NBA history has even had 25 games of each scoring 25 points before their 24th birthdays. UP NEXT:  For the Hornets, Tuesday @ Indiana, Wednesday @ Cleveland, Feb. 28th @ Chicago. For the Thunder, Wednesday vs. Boston, Thursday vs LA Lakers, Feb. 29th @ Philadelphia.
