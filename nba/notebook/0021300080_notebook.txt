 THE FACT:   Kevin Love  recorded his fourth career 30-15-5 game finishing with 32 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Love and  Kevin Martin  each scored 32 points to lead the Timberwolves to a 116-108 win over the Dallas Mavericks to improve to 4-2 on the season.  The win ended a short two-game losing streak for Minnesota and dropped Dallas to 3-3. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Me and Kevin Love, we challenge each other.  That's what I like about our relationship, we challenge each other a lot.  He actually out of that time out he told me to come down and pick for him and get him the ball.  I said, 'Well what are you going to do with it?'  He said just get me the ball."  
 -- Martin on a Love 3-pointer that put the Wolves up two possessions.  
 
 
 THE STAT:  Love either scored or assisted on 10 of the 11 made baskets in the first quarter, the lone exception was a  Corey Brewer  three with 7.6 seconds remaining.  Love finished the quarter with nine points and six assists. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Out of a timeout and with Minnesota leading 105-102, Love hit a three with 2:11 on the clock.  After a defensive stop, on the ensuing possession he hit a fadeaway to give the Timberwolves a 110-102 lead with 1:13 remaining.  Minnesota led for most of the second half so this was more of the nail in the coffin than it was a turning point. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:   "He shoots that one-footed, fadaway and it is...it is just not reasonable." 
 -- Wolves coach  Rick Adelman  on Dirk  Nowitzki's  patented fadeaway jumper.  
 
 
 NOT:   Ricky Rubio  was the lone Timberwolves starter not in double figures.  He finished with three turnovers and shot 2-for-8, contributing 6 points. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Love had an impressive fantasy first quarter which had him on pace for a triple-double by halftime. The forward ended the first quarter with nine points, six rebounds and six assists.  He also made a 3-pointer for an added fantasy bonus.   
 
 NOTABLE:  This was the second game time in five games where Love and Martin both scored in the 30s.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Saturday at Milwaukee, Tuesday vs. Washington, Friday @ Miami.  For the Timberwolves, Sunday @ L.A. Lakers, Monday @ L.A. Clippers, Wednesday vs. Cleveland.
