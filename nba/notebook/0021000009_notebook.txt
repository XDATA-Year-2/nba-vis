Francisco Garcia  started in Evans' place and scored 22 points on 7-for-12 shooting.  Carl Landry  also scored 22, including nine in a hard-fought final quarter. QUOTABLE:  "It feels great. The answer in the NBA is always 'It doesn't mean you win a championship if you win a game and its not a disaster if you lose,' but it sure feels good, especially a road win. Road wins are how you measure good teams, and we had a real hard time winning on the road last year. One of our big goals is to improve our road record." -- Sacramento coach  Paul Westphal , on the Kings winning their first season opener in seven years. THE STAT:  Sacramento got to the free throw line 47 times and made 35 of them. Minnesota coach  Kurt Rambis  highlighted silly fouls as the single biggest problem he had with his team's defensive performance. TURNING POINT:  With Minnesota up 58-49 late in the second quarter, Sacramento went on a 20-2 run. ROOKIE WATCH: DeMarcus Cousins  scored 14 points and grabbed eight rebounds including some key boards down the stretch. Westphal credited Cousins with keeping Minnesota off the offensive boards in the fourth quarter. NOTABLE:  Minnesota came into the game winners of 14 of its last 15 home openers. Sacramento had lost six straight season openers UP NEXT:  For the Wolves, Friday vs. Milwaukee, Saturday @ Memphis, Tuesday @ Miami. For the Kings, Friday @ New Jersey, Saturday @ Cleveland, Monday vs. Toronto.
