  Bucks-Suns notebook   By Mike Tulumello, for NBA.com Posted Thursday February 3, 2011 12:17AM THE FACTS:  The last time the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Suns in Phoenix,  Ronald Reagan  was the president, the Internet and cell phones may as well have been dreams of science-fiction buffs and a few current Bucks were yet to be born. And so nothing changed Wednesday night as the Suns rolled to their 23rd straight home win over the Bucks, an easy 92-77 decision. The Bucks' last win in Phoenix came on Feb. 21, 1987. This is the second longest active streak of its kind; the Spurs have won 25 straight at home over the Warriors. By winning, the Suns (23-24) pulled to within two games of No. 8 Portland in the West, though the Trail Blazers would have the tie-breaker for the final playoff spot. The Suns have won three straight and eight of the past 11. The Bucks, who rallied briefly in the fourth quarter to pull within 74-65, fell to 19-28. The Bucks buried themselves with 28 percent shooting in the first quarter as the Suns rolled to a 25-17 lead, one they stretched to 52-31 by halftime. Bucks center  Ersan Ilyasova  shot 1-for-6 in the first quarter, 1-for-8 for the first half. He started in place of  Andrew Bogut , who sat out with a sore knee. In addition, the Bucks announced forward  Drew Gooden  will miss several weeks with a foot injury. Corey Maggette  shot 6-for-12 for 15 points. Ilyasova ended up with 15, too, but he shot 7-for-20. Marcin Gortat  led the Suns with 19 points and 11 boards. QUOTABLE:  "Nobody talks more. He's a talker. But he works his butt off. That gives him instant respect in the locker room.    -- Suns coach  Alvin Gentry  on Gortat. THE STAT:  The Bucks shot just 31 percent, a season-low for a Suns' opponent. That's also the lowest figure for a Suns' opponent since they set a franchise record by holding the Nuggets to .263 on April 1, 2003. TURNING POINT:  About an hour before tipoff, when the Bucks announced Bogut wouldn't play. That helped the Suns, who normally are outrebounded, dominate the boards 54-39. QUOTABLE II:  "It was a very humbling game. Obviously, we were short-handed but...We looked like mummies in the first half..."    -- Bucks coach  Scott Skiles . HOT:  Gortat is sizzling. In the three previous games, he matched or set personal career scoring bests. So in his last four games, he's averaged 19.8 points on 67 percent shooting plus 11.5 rebounds. NOT:  After shooting 0-for-4 vs. the Bucks (including 0-for-3 on 3-pointers),  Mickael Pietrus ' shooting percentage dropped to 36 percent since he came over in the big trade with the Magic in December. He's 30 percent on 3-pointers with the Suns. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Though Gentry prefers to start  Robin Lopez , Gortat figures to continue to play 25-30 minutes per game off the bench. On Wednesday, he played 34 minutes. NOTABLE:  The Suns are 18-0 vs. the Bucks in their current building. UP NEXT:  For the Bucks, Thursday at Golden State, Saturday vs. Pistons, Tuesday vs. Raptors. For the Suns, Friday vs. Thunder, Monday @ Golden State, Thursday, Feb. 10 vs. Warriors.
