  Notebook: Nuggets 105, Bucks 95   By Rick Braun, for NBA.com Posted Tuesday January 17, 2012 11:48PM THE FACTS: Corey Brewer  scored 22 points off the bench, and  Al Harrington  added 16 from the bench, including four 3-pointers, to lead the Denver Nuggets to a 105-95 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday night. QUOTABLE:  "We wanted to stay body-to-body. On the first play I was ready to commit suicide because the whole game-plan was to not let him have easy baskets and to make him shoot over us as much as possible and plug him from the guards and perimeter guys and collapse on his dribble as much as possible."   -- Nuggets coach  George Karl  on his team holding Bucks center  Andrew Bogut  scoreless after the first basket of the game THE STAT:  The Nuggets were 12-for-25 on 3-pointers, with Harrington going 4-for-6, guard  Arron Afflalo  3-for-4 and Brewer 3-for-6. The Bucks, meanwhile, were just 7-for-23 after going 20-for-36 in their previous two home games. TURNING POINT:  The Nuggets went on a 19-4 run midway through the second quarter, turning a 37-33 lead into a 56-37 lead. The Bucks would get no closer than nine the rest of the way. QUOTABLE II:  "We're not close to really understanding how hard we need to play and how hard we have to compete and pay attention to detail."   -- Bucks coach  Scott Skiles , whose team fell to 4-9 with its first home loss and third straight overall HOT:  Bucks point guard  Brandon Jennings  finished with a game-high 30 points on 13-for-22 shooting, but he was the only truly effective player for the Bucks, who finished 38-for-91 (41.8 percent). NOT:  Bucks swingman  Carlos Delfino  made just three of 12 shots and is 12-for-40 (30 percnet) in his last four games. ROOKIE WATCH:  Bucks forward  Tobias Harris , the 19th overall pick, played 27 minutes and finished with 14 points and eight rebounds. The rebound total doubled his previous high. NOTABLE:  Bucks swingman  Mike Dunleavy  was declared out for 2-4 weeks a week ago because of groin pain. Dunleavy worked out hard on the court before the game and said he felt as though he would be closer to the two weeks out rather than the four weeks. Dunleavy has missed the last 10 games. ... Officials used replay and reversed a first-quarter call, taking a basket away from the Bucks.  Jon Leuer' s jump shot with 5:32 was ruled to have beaten the shot clock, but during a timeout with 2:57 left in the quarter they reviewed the video and ruled the shot came after the shot clock had expired. Instead of a 15-12 lead, the Nuggets led 15-10. ... Bucks forward  Luc Richard Mbah a Moute  was cleared to play after missing 10 of the first 12 games with right knee tendinitis, but Skiles opted not to play him. ... The game was the opener of a five-game road trip for the Nuggets. UP NEXT:  For the Nuggets, Wednesday @ Philadelphia, Friday @ Washington, Saturday @ New York. For the Bucks, Friday @ New York, Sunday @ Miami, Monday vs. Atlanta.
