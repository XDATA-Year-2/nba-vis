 THE FACT:  The Knicks snapped a seven-game home losing streak and have now won two straight for the first time since April. 
 
 THE LEAD: Carmelo Anthon y went for 20 points on an efficient 6-for-10 shooting, 11 rebounds and four assists as the Knicks won their second straight game, 121-83, over the Orlando Magic at Madison Square Garden Friday night. 
 The Knicks (5-13) have won back-to-back games by a combined 78 points.  J.R. Smith  and  Andrea Bargnani  tallied 17 points apiece, while  Raymond Felton  added 14 points and five assists.  Tim Hardaway Jr.  added 15 points off the bench,  Metta World Peace  scored 12 and  Iman Shumpert  had 10 
 
 Arron Afflalo  led the Magic (6-13) with 20 points and  Victor Oladipo  added 17 points and nine rebounds.  Jameer Nelson  scored 13 in the loss. The Magic have lost four in a row. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We got tired of losing. ...I think everybody's starting to get on the same page. Everyone's doing their job and as a result of that we're starting to win basketball games."  
 
 -- Carmelo Anthony on the MSG Network after the game 
 
 
 THE STAT:  After going 16-for-27 from the arc in Thursday's win at Brooklyn, the Knicks shot 17-for-34 from the arc (50 percent) against the Magic. 
 
 THE STAT II:  The Knicks' reserves outscored the Magic bench 57-21. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  After trailing 17-7 in the first quarter, the Knicks went on a 36-18 run to take a 43-35 lead in the second. They hit five straight 3-pointers to open the second period and finished 10-for-18 (56 percent) from the arc in the first half. New York then outscored Orlando 30-15 in the third to take an 89-69 lead after three. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "That's kind of how we played last year, it's kind of nice to see again." 
 
 -- Knicks coach  Mike Woodson 
 
 
 HOT:  Afflalo went for 20 after scoring a career-best 43 points in Tuesday's loss at Philadelphia. 
 
 NOT:  Magic reserve  Moe Harkless  managed just six points on 3-for-6 shooting in his return home. The former St. John's star is a Queens, N.Y., native. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "If they can continue to play like that, then we'll win our fair share of games."  
 
 -- Mike Woodson about his bench 
 
 
 QUOTABLE IV:  "It's a great feeling. When you look at the bench, when you look at our team you see guys having fun. That's the Knicks' team I know about. We're bringing fun back into the game of basketball... It don't stop here. We want to continue the streak on Sunday against the Celtics."  
 
 -- Carmelo Anthony 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Despite sitting at 5-13, the Knicks are only 2 ½ games back in the woeful Atlantic Division. "It's crazy. When you look at it, it really is because nobody is tearing it up," Woodson said. "My job is to preach to our team that it's still wide open and we still got a chance to go out and get another division title." 
 
 NOTABLE II: Amar'e Stoudemire  (knees)  sat out for the Knicks. "Hopefully, the next back-to-back, he'll be ready to go," Woodson said, adding that, "He'll play Sunday [against Boston]." 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  Liam Payne and Niall Horan of the boy band One Direction sat courtside. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Knicks, Sunday vs. Boston, Tuesday @ Cleveland, Wednesday vs. Chicago. For the Magic, Sunday @ Houston, Monday @ Memphis, Wednesday @ Charlotte.
