 THE FACT:  The league's top scoring bench unit continued to shine, as San Antonio's reserves outscored Dallas' bench 49-28. 
 
 THE LEAD:  A late scratch from the starting lineup,  Danny Green  came off the bench to pour in 22 points, leading the San Antonio Spurs (23-7) to a 116-107 win over the Dallas Mavericks (16-13) on Thursday night at the American Airlines Center. 
 
 Tony Parker  paced the starters with 23 points, and  Tim Duncan  chipped in 21 to lead San Antonio to a sixth consecutive win over its Southwest division rivals. Trailing by 15 in the fourth quarter, Dallas chipped San Antonio's lead down to three behind 13 fourth-quarter points from  Monta Ellis , who finished with 23, but San Antonio ended the game on a 16-10 run to preserve the victory. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We're very happy to win the game. Any win in the NBA is a good win. When you do it on the road on a back-to-back against a good team it feels even better. We're thrilled to get out of here with a win." 
 -- Spurs coach  Gregg Popovich 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Green joined  Jordan Hill  and  Chandler Parsons  as the only players to not miss a shot from the floor and score at least 20 points in a game this season. Green became the first reserve to accomplish the feat since  Amir Johnson  did it on March 4, 2013, and finished with 22 points on 7-of-7 shooting, including 5-of-5 from beyond the arc. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  With the Mavericks mounting a late rally to pull the game to within three at 110-107,  Manu Ginobili  pump-faked a shot, getting  Monta Ellis off his feet, drawing contact to make a trip to the line. The veteran guard sank both attempts, keying a 6-0 Spurs run to end the game.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "This is one of the things when you play San Antonio -- you have to be really precise with your offense and your defense and we just had little slippages here and there. Their team has been together for a long time. They are highly skilled. They have a lot of guys that are great players and they took advantage of it." 
 -- Mavericks coach  Rick Carlisle 
 
 
 HOT:  While Parker struggled from the field, shooting just 6-for-18, the veteran floor general was on fire from the line, going 11-for-12. ...  Jose Calderon  continued to scorch the nets from beyond the arc, going 3-for-4 from long range en route to 13 points. 
 
 NOT:   Shawn Marion  shot just 1-for-9 from the field, posting four points. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Earning his ninth start in the last 10 games,  DeJuan Blair  recorded a double-double with 14 points and 10 rebounds in his first game against his former squad. ... The NBA's active leader in double-doubles added another to his collection, as Duncan tallied 21 points and 13 rebounds. ...  Dirk Nowitzki  finished with 25 points, his sixth consecutive game with at least 20 points. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  Christmas came a day late for one lucky fan who drilled a half-court shot to win a 70-inch television. 
 
 NOTABLE:   Brandan Wright  (illness) was not available for the Mavericks. ...  Vince Carter  became the 10th player in NBA history with 1,700 career 3-pointers. ...  Tiago Splitter  attempted a career-high 11 free throws. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Saturday @ Chicago, Monday @ Minnesota, Wednesday @ Washington. For the Spurs, Saturday vs. Sacramento, Tuesday vs. Brooklyn, Thursday vs. New York.
