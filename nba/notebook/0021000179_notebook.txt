  Bulls-Mavericks Notebook   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Saturday November 20, 2010 1:25AM THE FACTS:   Taj Gibson, Joakim Noah  and the Bulls outrebounded the Mavericks by 25, outscored them by 16 in the paint and overcame a 12-point, second-half deficit in Friday's rare 88-83 win in Dallas. The Mavs, who had won five straight and 12 of the last 13 meetings here, got 36 from  Dirk Nowitzki , but notched season lows for points in a quarter (13 in the first), a half (35 in the first half) and a game. QUOTABLE:  "I wanted to establish inside and I thought that he had gotten into a lot of jump shooting. We're confident in his jump shot, but he's one of our best low-post scorers, so we've got to do a better job of getting him the ball in there."    -- Bulls head coach Tom Thibodeau on Gibson, who was just 1-for-16 from the field in his two previous games. THE STAT:  Chicago dominated the glass, 59-34, and turned 20 offensive rebounds into 25 second-chance points. Dallas managed nine offensive boards and eight second-chance points. TURNING POINT:  Gibson grabbed a career-high 18 rebounds, but it was his first career 3-pointer that helped to swing the momentum. Trailing 77-76, he came up with the loose ball after  Tyson Chandler  rejected a layup attempt by C.J. Watson. Rushing to beat the shot clock, Gibson launched the 25-footer and swished it. He finished with 16 points. QUOTABLE II:  "I think except for Dirk, a lot of guys struggled tonight, but I don't think the game was lost on the offensive end. We just gave up way too many offensive rebounds." --  Mavericks center  Brendan Haywood. HOT:   Derrick Rose  registered his fifth straight 20-point game for Chicago, finishing with 22 points and six assists.  Kyle Korver  (14) and Watson (13) scored in double figures off the Bulls' bench. NOT:  Dallas guards  J.J. Barea  (0-for-7),  Jason Kidd  (1-for-4) and  Jason Terry  (3-for-15) combined to shoot 15.4 percent from the field. They were 2-for-13 from behind the arc. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Noah notched his eighth double-double with 10 points and 17 rebounds to go with five assists and two steals. Nowitzki scored a season-high 36 points on 15-for-26 shooting, including 3-for-5 from 3-point range. He only made two 3-pointers in the Mavericks' first 10 games. NOTABLE:  Home-court advantage continues to elude the Mavericks. They are 3-1 on the road, but are off to a mediocre 4-3 start at the American Airlines Center. Last season, Dallas had one of the worst home records among Western Conference playoff teams at 28-13. UP NEXT:  For the Bulls, Tuesday @ L.A. Lakers, Wednesday @ Phoenix, Friday @ Denver. For the Mavericks, Saturday @ Atlanta, Tuesday vs. Detroit, Wednesday @ Oklahoma City.
