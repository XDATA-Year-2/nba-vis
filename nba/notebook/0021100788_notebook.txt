  Notebook: Clippers 94, Mavericks 75 Posted Monday April 2, 2012 11:52PM By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  The Los Angeles Clippers ran their longest winning streak in 20 years to six in a row with a rare 94-75 road victory Monday against the Dallas Mavericks.  Randy Foye  tied a franchise record with eight 3-pointers and scored 28 points to help the Clippers snap a 10-game losing streak at the American Airlines Center. The Clippers' last six-game winning streak was from March 18-31, 1992, and their last road win against the Mavericks was on April 19, 2006.  Blake Griffin  contributed 15 points and a game-high 16 rebounds in the victory. Dirk Nowitzki  had 19 points and  Jason Terry  added 15 for the short-handed Mavericks (30-24). Playing without Jason Kidd (right groin strain) and Lamar Odom (stomach illness), Dallas dropped further behind the Clippers (32-21) in the Western Conference standings. Los Angeles took two out of three to win the season series with the defending champs. QUOTABLE:  "He was just feeling it obviously. We got him in some rhythm. They went zone and they lost him a few times on the left wing. ... He hit a couple tough ones. They left him a couple of times, but he just got into a rhythm. When they were making runs, he hit a three probably two or three times, which kind of set them back."  --  Clippers head coach  Vinny Del Negro  on Foye. THE STAT : In the two decades since the Clippers' last six-game winning streak, the Mavericks put together 26 regular-season streaks of six or more victories (including a six-game streak from Feb. 8-17 this season). TURNING POINT:  Dallas pulled within seven early in the second quarter, but L.A. received a big lift from its bench to push the lead back to double figures for good.  Nick Young  scored seven straight points with a layup, a 19-footer and a 3-pointer and  Eric Bledsoe  followed with back-to-back pull-up jumpers during the 11-2 surge, putting the Clippers up 39-23 with 5:08 left in the half. QUOTABLE II:  "I was waiting for somebody to knock him down, do something. We just didn't do it, and really that's on me. If we're not aware and if we're not going to be physical with a guy that gets it going like that, then it's on the head coach."  --  Mavericks head coach  Rick Carlisle  on Foye. HOT:  Foye was 8-for-15 behind the arc and matched a team record for 3-point field goals set by  Quentin Richardson , who was 8-for-11 in a 36-point effort at Boston on Feb. 4, 2004. Foye's previous career high was six treys, set while with Minnesota on Jan. 7, 2009 against Oklahoma City. NOT:  The Mavs had just 33 points at halftime on 35 percent shooting (14-for-40), their lowest-scoring first half at home this season and second-lowest overall behind a 29-point effort at San Antonio back on Jan. 5. Dallas shot 2-for-12 from 3-point range in the first half. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Griffin saw his streak of six consecutive 20-point games come to an end. He was 7-for-11 from the field and just 1-for-5 at the stripe.  Chris Paul  dished 10 assists, former Maverick  Caron Butler  scored 13 points and Young finished with 10. ROOKIE WATCH: Trey Thompkins  saw some action for the Clippers during garbage time and scored four points (2-for-2 field goals) in less than three minutes. NOTABLE:  Odom is day-to-day, but the Mavericks said that Kidd, 39, will not play the rest of the week. Dallas is 0-7 this season without Odom in the lineup. ... The Mavs' only lead of the night was 2-0. ... Terry sank his 1,759th career 3-pointer, one shy of tying former teammate  Peja Stojakovic  for fifth place on the NBA's all-time list. ... The Clippers outscored the Mavericks 16-2 in fastbreak points. ... Los Angeles is 17-1 when holding opponents under 90 points.
