  Wolves-Thunder notebook   By Randy Renner, NBA.com Posted Friday March 25, 2011 11:36PM THE FACTS:  The Oklahoma City Thunder blew a 16-point lead then used a big fourth quarter to blow past the short-handed Minnesota Timberwolves 111-103 inside a sold out Oklahoma City Arena. The Thunder led 74-58 four minutes into the third quarter but the Wolves came all the way back to tie the game at 82 just before the end of the third. Back-to-back 3-pointers by Thunder All-Star  Kevin Durant  in the last seconds of the quarter spurred OKC to a 16-3 run and some breathing room. Durant led Oklahoma City with 23 points and  Russell Westbrook  added 19 and dished eight assists.  Serge Ibaka  had a double-double with 12 points and 10 rebounds. The Thunder had seven players in double figures.  Anthony Randolph , making his second start in place of injured All-Star  Kevin Love  led Minnesota with 24 points and 15 rebounds for his second straight double-double.  Michael Beasley  added 20 points and eight boards. QUOTABLE:  "I thought it was a solid win, everybody pitched in, seven guys in double figures. All four of our bigs were terrific."   --Thunder head coach  Scott Brooks THE STAT:  Oklahoma City's big men dominated the game. Centers  Kendrick Perkins  (13 points, five rebounds) and  Nazr Mohammed  (14 points and seven rebounds) combined for 27 points, 12 rebounds. Power forwards Ibaka (12 points, 10 rebounds) and  Nick Collison  (13 points, two rebounds) combined for 25 points and 12 boards. TURNING POINT:  After Minnesota rallied from 16 down to tie the game at 82, Durant hit two consecutive three balls to push Oklahoma City out front and key a 16-3 run that expanded to 23-7 with just under four minutes to play. QUOTABLE II:  "Those 3s were big shots. Our defense was being passive at the time, allowing the ball to go where ever it wanted to and they were hitting shots. KD hit those and the second unit extended the lead early in the fourth quarter."   -- Scott Brooks HOT:  In the first half Collison (6-for-6), Perkins (4-for-4) and Mohammed (2-for-2) combined to go 12-for-12 from the field. NOT:  Perkins was just 1-for-6 at the free-throw line and the Thunder as a team had one of their worst nights at the stripe going just 19-for-28 (67.9 percent). FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Randolph had another big night subbing for Love with 24 points on 9-for-16 shooting, 15 rebounds, two blocked shots and two assists. GOOD MOVE:  Early in the game Westbrook tried to get the ball down off the low block to Perkins but the big guy was double-teamed. So Westbrook passed instead to Ibaka in the lane who drove around Randolph to score. BAD MOVE:  Minnesota's big men were overly concerned about Mohammed, switching to a double team on him along the baseline midway through the second quarter. That move left the lane open and Collison took advantage of it, driving all the way in untouched to score. NOTABLE:  Oklahoma City now moves to 11-2 in March and 13-2 on Friday night. The Thunder are also 10-2 against Northwest Division opponents. Minnesota falls to 5-32 on the road including 0-7 on the road against Northwest Division opponents. UP NEXT:  For the Timberwolves, Sunday vs. Celtics, Wednesday vs. Bulls, Friday vs. Heat. For the Thunder, Sunday vs. Trail Blazers, Tuesday vs. Warriors, Wednesday @ Phoenix.
