 THE FACT:  The Knicks dropped to 7-14 at home. 
 
 THE LEAD:  The Brooklyn Nets repaid the New York Knicks for a 30-point homecourt blowout loss last month by hammering their inter-borough rivals 103-80 on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day at Madison Square Garden. 
 
 Joe Johnson  led the Brooklyn assault with 25 points,  Andray Blatche  posted 19 points and 12 rebounds and  Alan Anderson  scored 13 points as the surging Nets (17-22) have now won seven of eight. 
 After missing five games with ankle issues,  Deron Williams  came off the bench and added 13 points and three assists. 
 
 Carmelo Anthony  went for 26 points and 12 rebounds as the Knicks (15-26) dropped their fourth straight and fell to 0-2 on this eight-game homestand. 
 
 J.R. Smith  added 15 points and  Tim Hardaway Jr.  11 off the bench for the Knicks, who scored a season-low 80 points. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "They came into our building and embarrassed us, so we wanted to return the favor." 
 --  Andray Blatche 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Nets shot 14-for-38 from beyond the arc, and the Knicks went 8-for-25. 
 
 THE STAT II:  The Nets dished out 25 assists to the Knicks' 13. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The visiting Nets led 27-16 after one period and 52-38 at the break. Johnson had 20 points on 7-for-12 shooting by the half. Anthony had 15 points at the half, but the other four Knick starters combined for just nine points. Brooklyn shot 51 percent in the first half, and the Knicks shot 33 percent. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We couldn't make shots. We struggled to make shots. We missed free throws."  
 -- Knicks coach  Mike Woodson 
 
 
 WHO'S HOT:  Johnson went 8-for-15 from the field and 4-for-8 from beyond the arc en route to his 25 points. 
 
 WHO'S NOT:  One game after going 2-for-8 for five points, Knicks point guard  Raymond Felton  finished 2-for-11 for nine points with three turnovers. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "He's not playing the Raymond Felton basketball that we've seen. He's had two bad back-to-back games."  
 --  Mike Woodson 
 
 
 QUOTABLE IV:  "We're putting games together, we're putting quarters together. It's not just one quarter or two quarters or a half. We're being more consistent."  
 --  Paul Pierce 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  After being out since Dec. 16 with a broken toe,  Pablo Prigioni  returned for the Knicks. He started in the backcourt alongside Felton and finished with two points and two assists in 19 minutes.  Amar'e Stoudemire  and  Kenyon Martin  remain out for the Knicks with sprained left ankles. 
 
 NOTABLE II:  The Nets were playing their first game since beating Atlanta 127-110 in London on Thursday. 
 
 NOTABLE III:  Pierce and  Kevin Garnett  combined for nine points and the Nets still won by 23. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:   Liv Tyler ,  Chris Rock ,  Michael J. Fox ,  John Legend  and  Chrissy Teigen  sat courtside. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Knicks, Wednesday vs. Philadelphia, Friday vs. Charlotte, Sunday vs. L.A. Lakers. For the Nets, Tuesday vs. Orlando, Friday vs. Dallas, Sunday @ Boston.
