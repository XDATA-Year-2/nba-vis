The Hornets improved to 6-0, while the Bucks fell to 2-5 with their second straight home loss. QUOTABLE:  "It's my sixth year in the league and I've seen every defender you could possibly play. We thought coming into the game  [Luc Richard] Mbah a Moute  would guard me the whole game."   -- Hornets 6-foot point guard  Chris Paul  on being covered by the 6-foot-8 Mbah a Moute down the stretch and still getting two big baskets and two assists in the final four minutes. THE STAT:  On a night where the Bucks shot just 65 percent (13-for-20) from the line, they missed three straight that would have tied the game in the final two minutes. They were within 84-81 after Mbah a Moute scored and was fouled with 1:48 left. But Mbah a Moute missed the free throw, and 39 seconds later  Drew Gooden  missed two free throws. Instead of being tied, the Bucks still trailed by three and the Hornets were able to put the game away in the final minute. TURNING POINT:  The Bucks had cut what was once a 13-point deficit down to 67-65 on  Brandon Jennings ' 3-pointer with 7:07 left. From there, the Hornets got great balance down the stretch to hold off Milwaukee. Over the final 6:32,  Emeka Okafor  scored a 3-point play, Paul hit three short jumpers,  Marco Belinelli  hit a 16-footer and a 3-pointer,  Trevor Ariza  hit a 3-pointer and West dropped in three free throws. "We've got a lot of shooters on our team and it allows me to get in the lane and make plays when those guys are making shots," Paul said. QUOTABLE II:  "We're just shooting the ball terrible. I thought it was just me, but it's us as a combined group."   -- Bucks forward Drew Gooden on Milwaukee's 38.6 percent shooting Saturday night and 39.9 percent mark (223-for-559) for the season.
