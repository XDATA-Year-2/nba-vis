  Notebook: Mavericks 104, Warriors 94 Posted Friday April 20, 2012 11:45PM By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com THE FACTS: Vince Carter  scored all of his team-high 19 points in the second half Friday night as the playoff-bound Dallas Mavericks finished strong and closed out their home schedule with a 104-94 victory against the injury-depleted Golden State Warriors. Brandan Wright  added a season-high 17 points off the bench,  Dirk Nowitzki  and  Delonte West  each scored 16 and  Shawn Marion  added 14 for the defending champs, who extended their streak to nine straight games with at least five players scoring in double figures. Dallas (36-28), which had already clinched its 12th straight postseason berth, moved a game ahead of idle Denver (34-28) for the sixth seed in the Western Conference playoff picture. The Mavs dominated the glass with a 52-35 rebounding margin and a 16-2 difference in second-chance points. Their bench outscored the Warriors 54-22. Golden State (22-40) extended its season-long losing streak to seven and has dropped 14 of 16.  Klay Thompson  paced the Warriors with 26 points.  Brandon Rush  added 20 points and eight rebounds off the pine and  Dorell Wright  scored 19. QUOTABLE:  "I really enjoyed the season here. I love the crowd. The crowd was on my side the whole year. They cheered us and they stood behind us every game. We really appreciate their support."  --  Wright on playing at the American Airlines Center, where Dallas finished the regular season with a 23-10 record. THE STAT:  Friday's entire starting lineup for the Warriors has played a combined total of 12 seasons. Including 2011-12, seven different players on the Mavericks' roster have played at least 12 seasons. TURNING POINT:  The game was tied at 67-67 with less than three minutes remaining in the third quarter when Dallas took control with a 22-8 run through the 7:31 mark of the fourth. Carter scored 10 points during that stretch, including the Mavericks' first eight points in the fourth quarter. QUOTABLE II:  "I thought it was an outstanding effort when you look at the team that we're putting on the floor. A lot of injuries, a lot of young guys. I'm proud of the way they competed and battled against a championship team and found a way to hang in until the fourth quarter when [the Mavericks] clearly separated themselves."  --  Warriors head coach  Mark Jackson . HOT:  Wright scored 13 points for Dallas on 6-for-6 shooting in the second quarter alone. He only missed one of his nine shots in the game and added seven rebounds in 17 minutes. NOT:  The Mavericks misfired on their first 14 attempts from 3-point range before West drained a third-quarter buzzer-beater from the corner. Dallas finished 3-for-19 and extended the longest streak in NBA history to 1,084 straight regular-season games with at least one trey, dating back to Feb. 27, 1999. GOOD MOVE:  Facing a tough back-to-back Saturday at Chicago, Dallas was able to rest veteran point guard  Jason Kidd , 39, for the entire fourth quarter. BAD MOVE:  Golden State had some momentum going early in the third, but left a lot of points on the board by missing its first seven free-throw attempts in the quarter. The Warriors finished 11-for-21 at the stripe, compared to a near-perfect 25-for-26 effort by the Mavericks. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Thompson continued his push for All-Rookie honors, going 11-for-22 from the field (3-for-4 behind the arc) and registering four assists and three rebounds. ROOKIE WATCH: Charles Jenkins  had a double-double with 10 points, 10 assists and three steals and  Jeremy Tyler  tallied 15 points, eight rebounds and three steals. INSIDE THE ARENA:  The Mavericks sold out all 33 home games this season, extending the league's longest active streak to 432 consecutive regular-season sellouts (490 including the playoffs). The streak began on Dec. 15, 2001. NOTABLE:   Nate Robinson  (right hamstring strain) missed a second straight game and  Andris Biedrins  (concussion) did not make the trip for Golden State. ... Swingman  Kelenna Azubuike , signed on March 23, made his debut for the Mavericks against his former team. He checked in for the first time at 8:46 of the second quarter and played 6:06, going 0-for-2 from downtown. Azubuike last played in the NBA in November 2009. ... Dallas improved to 30-2 when leading after three quarters, including 20-0 at home. ... Carter's 3-pointer with 3:11 left in the game made him the 18th player in NBA history with 1,500 career triples. ... Dallas outscored the Warriors 16-2 in second-chance points. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Saturday @ Chicago, Thursday @ Atlanta. For the Warriors, Saturday @ Houston, Sunday @ Minnesota, Tuesday vs. New Orleans.
