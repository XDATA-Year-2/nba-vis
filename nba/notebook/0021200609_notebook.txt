 THE FACTS: Joe Johnson  hit a go-ahead, fall-away jumper over  J.R. Smith  with 22.3 seconds left, and  Deron Williams  made 3 of his final 4 foul shots down the stretch as the Nets beat the Knicks 88-85 on Martin Luther King Jr. Day at Madison Square Garden Monday. 
 Smith later missed a potential game-tying 3-point attempt at the buzzer. 
 The Nets (25-16) moved to within one game of the Atlantic Division-leading Knicks (25-14), two in the loss column. They also evened the season series at 2-2. 
 Johnson went for a team-best 25 points, including 10 in the fourth period. 
 For Brooklyn,  Brook Lopez  added 14 points and 11 rebounds and Williams had 14 points and 12 assists.  Kris Humphries  had 11 points and 13 rebounds. 
 
 Carmelo Anthony  led the Knicks with 29 points, but badly missed a six-foot jumper that would've given the Knicks an 86-85 lead. 
 Smith added 16 points off the bench and  Amar'e Stoudemire  had 15 for New York.  Tyson Chandler  tallied seven points and 11 rebounds. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "I don't make no excuses. I should've made the shot. I don't know what to say about that." 
 -- Carmelo Anthony 
 
 THE STAT : The Nets shot 12-for-24 from beyond the arc, led by Johnson's 5-for-8. The Knicks went 6-for-21 from deep, with Smith going 2-for-7. Brooklyn outrebounded the Knicks, 52-37. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "This is a big win for us. This was a big game to tie this thing up, this being Martin Luther King Day against the Knicks. This was a huge win."  
 -- Deron Williams 
 
 TURNING POINT : The Nets used an 11-2 fourth-quarter run to turn a 75-72 deficit into an 83-77 lead they never surrendered. Johnson scored eight points during the spurt, hitting two 3-pointers. 
 
 QUOTABLE III : "J.R. [Smith] was right there, but Joe [Johnson] was the better player in that situation."  
 -- Knicks coach  Mike Woodson  on the go-ahead jumper 
 
 WHO'S HOT : Johnson went 8-for-20 overall, but was 5-for-8 from deep to help take the game over down the stretch for Brooklyn. 
 
 WHO'S NOT : Playing in just his second game since returning from ACL surgery, Knicks guard  Iman Shumpert  went 1-for-6 for two points -- including 0-for-3 from deep -- while adding four rebounds in 20 minutes. 
 
 QUOTABLE IV : "It was pretty good defense until the end."  
 -- J.R. Smith on his defense on Joe Johnson 
 
 NOTABLE : Nets interim coach  P.J. Carlesimo  is now 11-2 since taking over for  Avery Johnson , who was fired. 
 
 QUOTABLE V : "We knew this game was big. They got on on our home floor [on Dec. 1] and we wanted to prove we could play in Madison Square Garden against them. I think we played well tonight."  
 -- Brook Lopez 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA : Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Bill Bradley sat courtside.
