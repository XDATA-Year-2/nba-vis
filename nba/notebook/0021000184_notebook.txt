  Mavericks-Hawks notebook   By Matt Winkeljohn, for NBA.com Posted Saturday November 20, 2010 11:51PM THE FACTS:  Dallas built leads of 18 points (53-35) in the second quarter, and 16 in the middle of the third (69-53), but needed former Hawk  Jason Terry  and  Dirk Nowitzki  each to hit a pair of free throws in the final 13 seconds of the game to help the Mavs hang on for a 98-93 win after the host Hawks pulled to within 94-93. Nowitzki led Dallas with 21 points as the Mavs snapped a two-game losing streak one night after losing at home to Chicago.  Al Horford  had 20 points and 20 rebounds for Atlanta, and  Josh Smith  scored 21 points but the Hawks (8-5) fell to 4-4 at home while Dallas (8-4) moved to 4-1 on the road. QUOTABLE:  "We were ticked off a little bit. We definitely made a conscious effort to block out." --  Mavs sub  Shawn Marion  after scoring 12 points with 10 rebounds as Dallas out-rebounded Atlanta 40-37 one night after the Bulls trounced the Mavs 59-34 on the boards to win in Dallas THE STAT:  A slew of numbers worked against the Hawks' reserves even though rookie  Jordan Crawford  scored 10 points off the bench. Dallas subs out-scored Atlanta's subs 38-19, out-rebounded the Hawks 18-7, and pitched in 12 assists. Terry scored 15 in a reserve role, and Marion had 12 points and 10 rebounds. Atlanta's  Jamal Crawford , the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year last season, had seven assists, but he made just 2 of 10 shots and had five turnovers. TURNING POINT:  Dallas coach  Rick Carlisle  said after the game that the Mavs want to be the best zone defense team in the NBA, and the Mavs played a lot of zone Saturday while holding Atlanta -- the NBA's top shooting team entering the game at 49.3 percent -- to 28 of 62 (45.2 percent) shooting through three quarters. Carlisle credited assistant  Dwane Casey  for teaching how to play zone, which he said is actually much more difficult than man-to-man. The Hawks didn't take advantage of long-distance shooting opportunities, making just 7 of 25 3-pointers. QUOTABLE II:  "I saw a low level of energy early in the game . . . and we talked about the Mavericks having played [Friday] night. Despite the back-to-back, this is a professional team that is going to come in here and give you their best effort. I went with kind of a smaller lineup. I thought Jordan Crawford gave us some really good minutes." --  Atlanta coach  Larry Drew , on his team's lethargy HOT:  The Mavs'  DeShawn Stevenson  made all three of his shots in the third quarter, all 3-pointers, and scored 11 points in the period with two rebounds as well. The rest of his teammates combined for 11 points in the third quarter. He made all of his shots in the game, too, scoring 13 points on 4 of 4 shooting. . . . Atlanta guard  Mike Bibby  followed a 16-point, seven-assist game in the Hawks' win Tuesday at Indianapolis with another 16-point outing. He made 4 of 7 treys. NOT:  The Hawks made just 3 of 14 3-pointers in the first half, falling behind 55-43 by halftime. . . . Atlanta sub  Maurice Evans  went 0-for-3 for the second game in a row as he continues to struggle coming off knee surgery. . . . Hawks leading scorer  Joe Johnson  had his second straight 11-point game, making 4 of 14 shots and just 1 of 6 treys. . . . Dallas sub  Jose Barea  made just 2 of 8 shots after missing all seven Friday night, but he hit a big 3-pointer with 9:50 left in the game to end an 18-5 Atlanta run over the end of the third quarter and start of the fourth that closed the Dallas lead to 79-74. In his past three games, Barea's made 4 of 28 shots. GOOD MOVE:  Rookie Jordan Crawford did not play in Atlanta's three previous games, nor in the first half Saturday, but he helped rally the Hawks to within hailing distance with five points in each of the final two quarters. Drew put Crawford in the game hoping for a spark, and that's what Crawford provided. NOTABLE:  With five steals,  Smith  passed Terry to move into sixth place in franchise history with 590 steals. Terry had 588 with Atlanta from 1999-2004. . . . Atlanta fell to 4-4 at home, and 1-3 at home against teams from the Western Conference. UP NEXT:  For the Mavs, Tuesday vs. Pistons, Wednesday @ Thunder, Friday @ Spurs. For the Hawks, Monday vs. Celtics, Tuesday @ Nets, Thursday vs. Wizards.
