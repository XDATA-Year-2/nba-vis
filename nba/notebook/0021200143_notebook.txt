 THE FACTS:   Thunder forward  Kevin Durant  had a double-double by halftime and finished with his first career triple-double as he and point guard  Russell Westbrook  combined for 55 points to lead Oklahoma City past Golden State 119-109. 
 Durant scored 25 points, pulled down 13 rebounds and handed out 10 assists. Westbrook led all scorers with 30 points.  Stephen Curry  led five Warriors in double figures with 22 points.  David Lee  had a double-double with 19 points and 12 rebounds and  Carl Landry  came off the Golden State bench to score 14. 
 Thunder sixth man  Kevin Martin  had another big night with 23 points on 5-for-7 shooting on 3-pointers.  Serge Ibaka  added 16 points and grabbed eight rebounds. 
 For the first time this season the Thunder allowed a team to shoot better than 50 percent (52.4 percent for the Warriors) but OKC countered that by draining 65 percent of its long balls (13-for-20). Golden State also dominated in the paint, outscoring Oklahoma City 58-32 but the Thunder had a big edge in fast-break points (26-12) and in second-chance points (14-7). 
 
 QUOTABLE:   "It feels good to finally get one. Serge and Russ kinda welcomed me to the club. I really wasn't thinking about it, if I got it great and if I didn't I was cool with that. But my teammates did a great job of setting me up and then they hit shots off a couple of my bad passes." 
 
 -- Durant on his first career triple-double 
 
 
 QUOTABLE II:   "Some guys can just pass, some guys can just score, some guys can just rebound. Kevin can do it all, he can make plays. He's an MVP caliber player and that's what MVP players do." 
 
 -- Thunder coach  Scott Brooks  on Durant's big night 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Durant's line for his first career triple-double: 8-for-16 overall (3-for-5 on 3-pointers), 13 rebounds (all defensive), 10 assists, two steals and two turnovers. 
 
 TURNING POINT:   OKC led by 22 after a 3-pointer from Martin early in the fourth quarter but the Warriors rallied to cut the lead all the way down to just seven (105-98) with a Curry three-ball with 5:59 to play. The Thunder then went on a 10-4 run with 3-pointers from Durant and Martin and jumpers from Ibaka and Westbrook to seal the deal. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "The Thunder have a couple of very special players and in their building you cannot make mistakes. I pointed out to our players that this is a process and they went through the same kind of experience and learned from it. It's important for us to do the same thing." 
 
 -- Warriors coach  Mark Jackson 
 
 
 HOT:  After missing seven of their first eight shots, the Warriors went 11-for-15 (73.3 percent) to finish out the first quarter. ... OKC was 6-for-9 (66.7 percent) on 3-pointers in the first half and finished at 65 percent (13-for-20). Westbrook was 12-for-22 (2-for-2 on 3-pointers). Jarrett Jack was 6-for-8. 
 
 NOT:   The Warriors started the game just 1-for-8 (12.5 percent). ... Curry was 2-for-8 in the first half. ...  Klay Thompson  finished 2-for-8. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:   The 74th straight sellout inside OKC's Chesapeake Energy Arena. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Late in the first quarter Westbrook passed into the middle of the lane to  Thabo Sefolosha  who goes up but instead of taking a shot fired a bounce pass to a wide open  Hasheem Thabeet  who hit a layup. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Both Warriors guard Klay Thompson and his coach thought he was ready to come back after a bout with the flu but Thompson didn't seem to have his "A" game and finished the first half just 1-for-4 (two points) and did the same in the second half to finish with just four points. 
 
 NOTABLE:   Golden State forward  Richard Jefferson  left the game late in the first quarter with a right calf strain and did not return. He's listed as day-to-day. ... Westbrook left the arena with an ice pack on his left wrist but said he was fine. ... Durant had a double-double (13 points, 10 rebounds) at halftime. That's already the second time he's done that this season. Previously KD had just one halftime double-double in his career. ... The Warriors have now lost seven in a row in Oklahoma City. 
 
 UP NEXT:   For the Warriors, Monday @ Dallas, Wednesday vs. Brooklyn, Friday @ Denver. For the Thunder, Wednesday vs. L.A. Clippers, Friday @ Boston, Saturday @ Philadelphia.
