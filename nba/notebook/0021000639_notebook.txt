  Hawks-Bobcats notebook   By Derek S. Smith, for NBA.com Posted Saturday January 22, 2011 10:15PM THE FACTS:   Joe Johnson  scored 32 points as the Atlanta Hawks scored a come-from-behind victory over the Charlotte Bobcats 103-87 Saturday night at Time Warner Cable Arena.  Josh Smith  added 16 for the Hawks while  D.J. Augustin  led the Bobcats with 20 points. QUOTABLE:  "We were just more aggressive in the second half. We came out and made the plays we had to. We played with a lot more energy than last night and started to play Hawks basketball again."   -- Atlanta Hawks guard Joe Johnson THE STAT:  The Hawks took advantage of their aggressive play and were able to earn 23 trips to the free-throw line. Once there, Atlanta connected on 20-of-23 attempts while their strong defense limited to Charlotte to just 12 trips to the charity stripe. TURNING POINT:  The Hawks went on a 9-0 run early in the third quarter to erase an eight-point Bobcats advantage. Johnson started the run with an easy layup and added another bucket on the team's next possession. The run was capped by a  Mo Evans  three with 8:27 to play in the third. The Bobcats would take the lead again twice, but the run gave the Hawks the momentum they needed for the victory. HOT:  Augustin netted 20 points for the Bobcats Saturday. The Charlotte point guard was 8-for-17 from the floor including 3-for-4 from behind the arc while adding seven assists and committing no turnovers.
