 THE FACTS : The road weary Dallas Mavericks came into Sleep Train Arena Friday needing a win to stay in the playoff hunt after dropping a heartbreaker last night, and got just what the doctor ordered as the Sacramento Kings gave very little resistance in the second half and lost by the final of 117-108.   
 
 Shawn Marion  was all over the court, finishing with 25 points and 12 rebounds in 33 minutes.   Brandan Wright  came off the Dallas (37-39) bench and methodically buried Sacramento with a basic, but unstoppable play set.  The defensive specialist score 20 points on 9-for-14 shooting and  Darren Collison  added 18 points and eight assists in 30 minutes of action. 
 
 Isaiah Thomas  had no problem scoring for the Kings (27-49), dropping in a game-high 29 points on 9-for-20 shooting.   Tyreke Evans  stuffed the stat sheet with 26 points, nine rebounds and six assists.   Jason Thompson  played the bulk of the minutes at the center position, finishing with 16 points and 16 rebounds in 37 minutes in the loss. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "It's just tough as a player.  I always say when you have inconsistent minutes, you're going to have inconsistent production."  
 --Isaiah Thomas on his coach's erratic substitution patterns 
 
 THE STAT : Thomas, the Kings starting point guard, played 36 minutes and finished with a single assist.  
 
 TURNING POINT : The Kings cut the Mavericks lead to 94-90 at the 10:17 mark of the fourth, but Dallas responded with a 9-0 run to put the game away.  
 
 QUOTABLE II : "I don't have to be given a reason, he [is] the coach."  
 -- DeMarcus Cousins  on being benched and playing only nine minutes tonight 
 
 HOT : Wright was unstoppable on the pick and roll, scoring 20 points on 9-for-14 shooting in just 26 minutes.  The NBA is a game of adjustments and the Kings are still trying to figure out how to stop Wright, who averages 8.2 points per game on the season. ... Evans was also on a roll, cutting through the Dallas defense like a hot knife through butter.  He finished with 26 points on 10-for-15 shooting.  
 
 NOT: John Salmons  was a non-factor in this game, scoring just three points on 1-for-6 shooting.  On the season, Salmons is either hot or invisible and there is no telling which he will be from one night to the next. 
 
 GOOD MOVE : The Mavs fed Marion all night long and the veteran wing responded with a big night, leading Dallas in both points and rebounds. 
 
 BAD MOVE : Cousins did something to draw the ire of Kings coach  Keith Smart .  Not only was he benched to start the game, but he played a total of nine minutes on the night.   
 
 NOTABLE: Vince Carter  notched his 4,000th career assist in the second quarter. ... Smart benched Cousins to start the game, sitting his starting center for the first 12 minutes of the game before bringing him out to start the second quarter.   
 
 UP NEXT : For the Mavs, Sunday @ Portland, Wednesday vs. Suns, Friday vs. Denver. For the Kings, Sunday vs. Memphis, Wednesday vs. New Orleans, Friday @ San Antonio.
