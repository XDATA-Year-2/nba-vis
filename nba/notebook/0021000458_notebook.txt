  Bulls-Bucks notebook   By Kent McDill, for NBA.com Posted Tuesday December 28, 2010 11:17PM THE FACTS: Luol Deng  and  Carlos Boozer  each scored 24 points and the Bulls outlasted the visiting Milwaukee Bucks 90-77 Tuesday at the United Center. The Bucks shot just 32 percent for the game but the Bulls could not put them away until the final four minutes of the game.  John Salmons  led the Bucks with 18 points, but  Andrew Bogut  had just four points on two for 12 shooting (although he did have 16 rebounds). The Bucks played without point guards  Brandon Jennings  (injury) and  Earl Boykins  (suspension). THE FACTS II:  The Bucks, the lowest scoring and worst shooting team in the league, scored their first basket of the game at the 7:31 mark of the first quarter after missing their first nine shots. At the start of the second half, they did not get their first basket until the 8:23 mark of the third quarter. QUOTABLE:  "We did a good job in the fourth quarter. At the end of the day it is a win. Nobody is going to look at how you got it. We are starting to learn as a team that the most important thing is winning the game."    -- Bulls forward Luol Deng THE STAT: Derrick Rose  had 18 points and 12 rebounds for the Bulls, and made three of four 3-pointers after missing his previous 11 attempts. THE STAT II:  The Bucks took their first lead of the game at 43-42 on a pair of free throws by  Luc Mbah a Moute  with 1:26 left in the first half. At that point, the Bucks were shooting 31 percent from the field. TURNING POINT:   Kyle Korver  and Rose hit back-to-back baskets (Rose's was a three-pointer) and the Bulls opened an 83-70 lead with 3:41 left. HOT:  Boozer was 10-for-16 from the field for his 24 points and added nine rebounds for the Bulls. He has averaged 27 points and 12 rebounds in his last four games. NOT:  Salmons was five for 17 from the field, and  Chris Douglas-Roberts  was two for 11, "helping'' the Bucks to a 27-for-84 night from the field. QUOTABLE II:  "We've won games shooting poorly before. We won last year shooting 30 percent."    -- Milwaukee center Andrew Bogut after the Bucks shot 32 percent Tuesday. INSIDE THE ARENA:   Jason Sudeikis  of Saturday Night Live fame was at the game. Sudeikis used to work in Chicago as part of the city's improvisational comedy scene before joining Saturday Night Live. GOOD MOVE:  Milwaukee coach  Scott Skiles  moved Mbah a Moute into his starting lineup in the absence of Boykins and Jennings and Moute scored 12 points and added 10 rebounds. NOTABLE:  The Bulls are 5-0 in their Central Division. They are 20-10 after 30 games, after being 13-17 through 30 games last season. UP NEXT:  For the Bulls, vs. New Jersey Friday, vs. Cleveland Saturday, vs. Toronto Tuesday. For the Bucks, vs. Dallas Saturday, at Miami Tuesday, at Orlando Wednesday.
