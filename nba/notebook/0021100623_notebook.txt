  Notebook: Mavs 107, Wizards 98 Posted Tuesday March 13, 2012 11:56PM By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  Facing a struggling road team playing on the second night of a back-to-back, the Dallas Mavericks took care of business Tuesday with a much-needed 107-98 victory against the Washington Wizards at the American Airlines Center.  Dirk Nowitzki  scored 27 points,  Jason Terry  had 24 off the bench and  Rodrigue Beaubois  added 19 for the defending champs, who halted a three-game skid. Washington, tied for the fewest road victories in the league at 3-16, dropped its sixth straight away from home despite having six players in double figures and double-doubles from  Trevor Booker  (20 points, 12 rebounds) and  John Wall  (18 points, 10 assists). The Wizards are now 0-15 on the road this season when trailing at halftime and they are 1-8 on the second half of back-to-backs. QUOTABLE:  "Beaubois' game tonight from start to finish -- you look at offense, defense, decision-making -- it's one of his best games he's had here."   --Mavericks head coach  Rick Carlisle THE STAT:  The five starters for the Wizards have a combined 11 seasons of NBA experience (including this season), compared to 70 for the Mavericks' veteran starting unit. TURNING POINT:  After Washington scored 10 unanswered points to get within 70-68, Dallas pushed the lead back to 83-73 with buckets on six of its next eight trips: a 3-pointer by  Vince Carter  (14 points), a reverse by  Ian Mahinmi , a finger roll by Carter, two jumpers by Terry and an athletic putback by Beaubois. The Mavericks led by double digits nearly all of the fourth quarter. QUOTABLE II:  "We came in here and I thought we fought them tooth and nail. Against good teams like this, your margin for error for us, being what we are is a young team, is small."   -- Wizards head coach  Randy Wittman HOT:  Nowitzki knocked down his first seven shots and was 8-for-9 in the opening half, including 2-for-3 from 3-point range and 2-for-2 at the line for 20 points. Beaubois was 4-for-4 from the field and 2-for-2 at the stripe in the first half. Dallas shot 82 percent (14-for-17) in the second quarter. NOT:   Jordan Crawford  took a team-high 16 shots to score 15 points (5-for-16) for the Wizards.  Lamar Odom  was 1-for-6 and finished with more fouls (four) than points (three) for the Mavericks. GOOD MOVE:  Playing in his 1,300th career game,  Jason Kidd  showed he still had a few tricks up his sleeve during an 8-0 Dallas run late in the second quarter. On back-to-back possessions, he fired a pretty no-look pass to  Brendan Haywood  for a wide-open dunk and delivered an alley-oop toss to  Shawn Marion  from behind the 3-point line. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Marion contributed 10 points, a game- and season-high 13 rebounds and four assists. In addition to his 399th career double-double, Marion (15,649 points) passed  Antoine Walker  (15,647) for 100th place on the NBA's all-time scoring list. NOTABLE:  The Wizards attempted 23 more free throws (38-15) than the Mavs. ... Dallas dominated the battle of the boards, 51-38. ... The teams were dead even in points in the paint (40-40) and fastbreak points (17-17). ... Haywood returned from a four-game injury absence ( left ankle sprain) and tallied six points and eight boards. ... Dallas now has a 31-30 edge in the all-time series. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Thursday vs. Charlotte, Saturday vs. San Antonio, Monday @ Denver. For the Wizards, Thursday @ New Orleans, Friday @ Atlanta, Sunday @ Memphis.
