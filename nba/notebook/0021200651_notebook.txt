 THE FACTS:   Jamal Crawford 's 20-foot jump shot bounced off the rim as time expired, giving Portland a 101-100 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers Saturday night at the Rose Garden. The Trail Blazers (22-21) scored the game's final 10 points, holding the Clippers (32-13) scoreless after  Lamar Odom 's dunk gave them a 100-91 lead with 2:38 to play. 
 Crawford scored 16 of his 19 points in the second half, fueling a comeback that brought the Clippers from a 13-point third-quarter deficit to the nine-point lead in the closing minutes. 
 
 Nicolas Batum  collected 20 points, a career-high 12 assists and 10 rebounds -- his second triple-double in three games -- to lead Portland (22-21), which won its second straight game after losing six in a row. 
 
 Blake Griffin  had a game-high 24 points, matched his career high with 10 assists and grabbed eight rebounds for the Clippers (32-13), who matched a season high with their fourth straight loss. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "To end the game on a 10-0 run was a testament to what we've done for most of the season. We don't quit. We bounce back. We're resilient."  
 -- Portland coach  Terry Stotts 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Portland made five fewer field goals (40-35) than the Clippers but won the game at the 3-point line (11-for-25 to the Clippers' 7-for-16) and the foul line (20-for-21 to the Clippers 13-for-17). 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Blazers trailed 100-91 when rookie  Damian Lillard  drilled a 3-point shot to close the gap to 100-94 with 2:22 left. That kicked off Portland's closing 10-0 run. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I thought it was in. That's the shot I wanted. I saw the defense behind Nic [Batum]. I got the space I wanted -- everything. I thought it was in when I let it go."  
 -- Jamal Crawford on his game-winning shot attempt. 
 
 
 HOT:  The Blazers sank 4-for-5 3-point attempts in a 4 1/2-minute span of the third quarter as they built a 74-61 lead. 
 
 NOT:  The Clippers went 0-for-5 with a turnover on their final five possessions. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Crawford broke defender  Wesley Matthews ' ankles on a crossover move, sinking a short jumper in the first half. It was Crawford's only bucket in the half, though, as the former Blazers went 1-for-6 from the field. 
 
 GOOD MOVE II:  Portland switched the 6-foot-8 Batum onto the 6-foot-5 Crawford late in the game, providing a little more length for the former Blazer to shoot over.  
 
 NOTABLE:  It was Batum's second triple-double in the last three games. He is one of four NBA players with more than one triple-double this season. The others are Miami's  LeBron James , Boston's  Rajon Rondo  and Toronto's  Jose Calderon .  
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "He does everything well. People don't realize how good a playmaker he is, defender, rebounder, scorer, shooter. Him having a triple-double, I'm not surprised by it. He always has his hands in everything. I expect him to get more."  
 -- Damian Lillard on Batum. 
 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Clippers, Sunday vs. Portland, Wednesday @ Minnesota, Friday @ Toronto. For the Trail Blazers, Sunday @ L.A. Clippers, Tuesday vs. Dallas, Friday @ Utah.
