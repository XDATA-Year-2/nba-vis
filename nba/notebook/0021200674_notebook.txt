 THE FACTS:   Al Horford  scored 22 points, blocked two Toronto shots in the final 12 seconds, and his wide-open dunk with 21 seconds left helped the Hawks beat the shorthanded Raptors 93-92 Wednesday. 
 Atlanta (26-19) survived a frantic final sequence by Toronto (16-30), which dressed nine players after a trade that sent starting point guard  Jose Calderon  and starting power forward  Ed Davis  packing an hour before tip. 
 Yet with three starters new since Wednesday, the Raptors not only led by 13 in the second quarter, but had three shots to win in the final 13 seconds. 
 Their last shot came when Horford was not called for a foul despite laying a whole lot of body on Toronto's  DeMar DeRozan  as he tried score from point-blank range with a couple seconds left. Horford was credited with a blocked shot. 
 Horford had blocked  Kyle Lowry's  driving attempt out of bounds with 12 seconds left, and  Alan Anderson  missed a jumper with 4.9 to go. 
 DeRozan rebounded that, and went up only to find Horford all over him. 
 Horford gathered the ball and tossed it down court. The final seconds drained off the clock with Raptors coach  Dwane Casey  stomping on the court. DeRozan finished with a game-high 23 points. 
 
 John Lucas  scored nine of his season-high 19 points in the second quarter, when Toronto pushed its lead to 53-40 with an 11-0 run. 
 Starting for Calderon, Lowry had 14 points and 10 rebounds. The Raptors whipped the Hawks 52-36 on the boards as  Amir Johnson  had 14 and  Aaron Gray  10. Toronto, though, shot 33-for-85 (38.8 percent). 
 
 Josh Smith  (20 points, 11 rebounds, three steals, three blocked shots) and Horford (10 rebounds, six assists) each scored 14 points in the second half as Atlanta overcame a 55-45 halftime deficit. 
 
 QUOTABLE:   "Everything was happening really fast. My first instinct was the block the shot, and the ball just kind of hung around. I saw there was a second on the clock so I threw it out so they couldn't foul. It worked out." 
 -- Horford. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  4 -- The Hawks blocked four shots in the fourth quarter on a night when they swatted eight overall. Horford had two of his three in the period, Smith one of his three and  DeShawn Stevenson  his only one. 
 
 TURNING POINT:   Horford's game-winning dunk was a schematic thing of beauty. He set a screen on the right side for Kyle Korver. When Toronto center Gray stepped out on the Atlanta sharpshooter (5-for-9 on 3-pointers Wednesday), Horford flashed into the paint. 
 Smith, who had the ball at the top of the arc, whizzed a pass through the wide-open lane. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "They were hedging out on Kyle all night long, which is to be expected because he can knock down that shot. He has a very quick release. The play was run to perfection. Al set the screen, slipped it hard. I was able to threat it down the middle . ... it's our fourth-and-one play." 
 -- Smith on the game-winner. 
 
 
 HOT:   After shooting 5-for-9 on 3-pointers, Korver is 31-for-51 (60.8 percent) over his past seven games. He's shot 41-for-68 (60.3 percent) overall in that span, averaging 17.4 points. Korver is the NBA's leading 3-point shooter (46.8 percent). ... 
 
 NOT:  Toronto shot just 27.8 percent in the third quarter (5-for-18), when the Hawks outscored the Raptors 30-14. ... 
 
 NOTABLE:  In addition to playing without Calderon and Davis, the Raptors were without  Andrea Bargnani  (torn elbow ligament),  Linas Kleiza  (sore right knee),  Mickael Pietrus  (left knee tendinitis) and  Jonas Valanciunas  (broken finger). ...Hawks reserve center  Zaza Pachulia  was out for the second time in four games with a sore right Achilles' tendon. ...  Anthony Morrow  was back in uniform for Atlanta after missing 17 games with back and hip issues, but he did not play. ... Atlanta's last three home games have seen the Hawks overcome double-digit deficits to win: (-18 Jan. 21 vs. Minnesota; -27 Jan. 25 vs. Boston and -13 vs. Toronto). ... Atlanta has made at least 10 3-pointers in a franchise-record five straight games. 
 
 UP NEXT:   For the Raptors, Friday vs. L.A. Clippers, Sunday vs. Miami, Wednesday vs. Boston. For the Hawks, Saturday vs. Chicago, Tuesday @ Indiana, Wednesday vs. Memphis.
