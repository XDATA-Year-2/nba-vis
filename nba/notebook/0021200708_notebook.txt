 THE FACTS: Spencer Hawes  scored 21 points and swept a season-high 14 rebounds,  Nick Young  scored 15 points and the Philadelphia 76ers defeated the depleted Orlando Magic, 78-61, Monday night at the Wells Fargo Center.  Jrue Holiday  scored 13 points and handed out 14 assists while  Lavoy Allen  had 10 points for the Sixers, who won their third straight game. The Sixers improved to 21-26 and won three in a row for the first time since Nov. 25-30. But the news wasn't all good because forward  Thaddeus Young  crumpled to the floor with 5:46 left in the second quarter and didn't return because of a left hamstring strain. The Sixers didn't give a definitive timetable for Young's return, but coach  Doug Collins  said it would be "a while." 
 
 E'Twaun Moore  led the reeling Magic with 18 points while  Andrew Nicholson  scored 11 points. Former Sixer  Nikola Vucevic  had nine points and 14 rebounds and  Maurice Harkless  had 10 points. The Magic fell to 14-34 and dropped their 10th straight game. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It's going to be hard. You can't just replace that, what he brings every night." --  Hawes, on the loss of Thaddeus Young. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Magic had just 61 points, the second-fewest allowed by the Sixers since the shot clock was introduced for the 1954-55 season. It was also a floor record for least points by an opponent at the Wells Fargo Center, which opened in 1996. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Sixers led by just seven points at halftime but turned up the intensity in the third, increasing a 42-35 advantage to 60-46. They were never seriously threatened again. 
 
 HOT:  Hawes was 9-for-17 and Allen was 5-for-9. 
 
 NOT: Josh McRoberts  struggled mightily for the Magic, going 2-for-12. Vucevic was 3-for-10 and Ish Smith was 2-for-10. The Magic shot 27-for-80 -- 33.8 percent. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We did what we were supposed to do. We beat a team with a ton of injuries." --  Collins. 
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Hawes had 21 points, 14 rebounds (13 off the defensive glass), three assists and one blocked shot. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  There wasn't much of a buzz inside the arena for much of the night against the Magic.  Will Smith , who owns a stake in the Sixers, took in all the action from a front-row seat and received a huge ovation from the crowd of 14,630. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "We've been banged up all year and we've just continued to fight. We have to keep going out there and playing hard and we can't worry about who's hurt. It's been a season filled with injuries and we've just played through it while giving everything we've got." --  Vucevic. 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Hawes played extended minutes and responded with arguably his finest game of the season in 36:52. He contributed in every way imaginable and proved he's capable of producing, even with added playing time. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Magic could have gone to Vucevic more often. While Vucevic took 10 shots, he was also getting good looks in the low post. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Nicholson had 11 points and Harkless had 10. Forward  Kyle O'Quinn  had two points and four rebounds in 17:15. For the Sixers, forward  Arnett Moultrie  tied his career high with four points in 11:43. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Injured Sixers center  Andrew Bynum  met with reporters about 30 minutes before tip-off. Bynum has missed the entire season with bilateral bone bruises on both knees. But Bynum said he is hoping to play his first game this month. "Not a specific target, but February is the target," Bynum said. He added that an official practice date hasn't been set and he is anxious to make his debut for the Sixers. "I just want my first game to come," Bynum said. "I definitely won't be nervous." ... The Magic played without guards  Jameer Nelson  (left forearm contusion),  J.J. Redick  (sore right shoulder) and  Arron Afflalo  (strained left calf) along with forwards  Glen Davis  (fractured left foot),  Al Harrington  (right knee) and  DeQuan Jones  (sore left foot). ... Sixers guard  Jason Richardson  missed his sixth consecutive game with left knee synovitis. ... The Magic have now lost 10 straight games for the second time this season, the only team in the league to do so. ... Hawes registered his third double-double over the past six games and his seventh of the season. The Sixers are 14-10 when Hawes scores 10 or more points in a game. ... Holiday recorded his 13th double-double. ... The Magic shot 1-for-12 from beyond the arc while the Sixers were 3-for-20. 
 
 NEXT:  For the Magic, Wednesday vs. L.A. Clippers, Friday @ Cleveland, Sunday vs. Portland. For the Sixers, Wednesday vs. Indiana, Saturday vs. Charlotte, Monday vs. L.A. Clippers.
