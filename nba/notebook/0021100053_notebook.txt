  Notebook: Thunder 107, Suns 97   By Randy Renner, for NBA.com Posted Sunday January 1, 2012 12:01AM THE FACTS:  The celebration of the new year started early in Oklahoma City as the Thunder moved to 5-0 for the first time since the 1998-99 season. The Thunder become just the second team in NBA history to win five games during the first week of the season. Houston was 5-0 to start the 1996-97 campaign.  Kevin Durant  had a rare off night (12 points, 4-for-11 shooting) but his teammates shot 53.2 percent and led all the way in a 107-97 win over the Phoenix Suns. The Thunder bench scored almost half (53) of OKC's 107 points. The Thunder led by as many as 24 and led by 15-20 points from the middle of the second quarter till a late run pulled the Suns closer at the end. Six players scored in double figures led by point guard  Russell Westbrook 's 18. Durant,  Thabo Sefolosha  and  Daequan Cook  each had 12. Sefolosha and Cook were a combined 6-for-8 on 3-pointers. The Suns were led by a pair of bench players.  Shannon Brown  and  Hakim Warrick  each had 15 points and  Jared Dudley  added 14. Like Durant, it was an off night for Suns point guard  Steve Nash . He was just 3-for-10 shooting and scored eight points. The Suns shot just 39.8 percent on the night. Oklahoma City has held three of its first five opponents to less than 40 percent shooting. QUOTABLE:  "Our defense was really good, especially in the first half. Guys were excited on the defensive end."   -- Thunder coach  Scott Brooks THE STAT:  The young Thunder, coming off a day off, outran the older and more tired Suns. Phoenix was playing the second game of a back-to-back and couldn't keep up on the fast break. The Thunder outscored Phoenix 21-5 in fast break points. OKC also dominated down low, outrebounding the Suns 45-37 and outscoring them 54-42 in the paint. TURNING POINT:  A big second quarter by the Thunder saw a five-point lead after the first 12 minutes balloon out to 14 points (60-46) at the end of the second 12 minutes. OKC shot 61.9 percent in the quarter, led by second teamers Cook (4-for-5 on 3-pointers) and  Nazr Mohammed  (3-for-3). After that the lead never got back into single digits. QUOTABLE II:  "The second unit is good. They're playing well together and they understand each others' game."   -- Brooks HOT:  Oklahoma City hit its first three shots of the game and shot 57.9 percent in the first quarter and 60 percent for the half. ... Thunder guard Daequan Cook was 4-for-5 in the first half (all 3-pointers). Cook was quite literally "hot", he did not return to the game in the second half suffering from a fever and flu-like symptoms. ...  Serge Ibaka  finished the game 4-for-4. ... Suns rookie  Markieff Morris  was 5-for-8. NOT:  The Suns missed their first three shots of the game and shot 36 percent in the first quarter. ... Nash was 1-for-5 in the second quarter. ... Durant was 1-for-6 (two points) in the first half and finished 4-for-11. ... Thunder guard  Eric Maynor  was 0-for-4. ... Suns forward  Channing Frye  finished 1-for-6. INSIDE THE ARENA:  A festive New Year's Eve atmosphere as many Thunder fans wore dressy evening attire to the game then planned to hit parties afterward. With temperatures in the 60s at game time a crowd of more than 100,000 was expected downtown to ring in the new year. Former Oklahoma governor  Brad Henry  was among those at the game. The Suns TV crew did the game in style, sporting tuxedos. GOOD MOVE:  Thunder center  Kendrick Perkins  continues to showoff new moves after losing 30 pounds and getting his knees healthy over the summer. Midway through the first quarter Perkins grabbed a pass down low, battled Suns center  Marcin Gortat , spun, stepped back and nailed a 10-foot jumper. GOOD MOVE TOO:  Phoenix coach  Alvin Gentry  opted to use 38-year-old  Grant Hill  to guard 23-year-old Durant. The move paid off in the first half as Durant scored only two points on 1-for-6 shooting. NOTABLE:  Nash played in his 686th game for Phoenix. That moves him past  Dick Van Arsdale  into third place all-time for the Suns. He remains behind  Alvin Adams  and  Walter Davis.  ... Oklahoma City is now 4-0 on New Year's Eve. UP NEXT:  For the Suns, Monday vs Warriors, Wednesday @ Dallas, Friday vs Trail Blazers. For the Thunder, Monday @ Dallas, Tuesday vs Trail Blazers, Friday vs Rockets.
