 THE FACT:  With his third career triple-double,  Stephen Curry  became the seventh player in Warriors history with at least three triple-doubles. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Stephen Curry set career highs with 13 rebounds and 16 assists and scored 14 points,  leading the Golden State Warriors to a 115-86 victory Friday night over the Phoenix Suns at Oracle Arena. 
 
 Klay Thompson  scored a game-high 21 points, while  David Lee  had 17 points for the Warriors (18-13), who won their season high-tying fourth straight game, snapped the Suns' three-game winning streak and avenged a 106-102 loss to Phoenix (17-11) earlier this month. 
 
 Harrison Barnes  and  Draymond Green  came off the bench to score 11 points apiece for Golden State. 
 
 P.J. Tucker  led the Suns with 11 points and 12 rebounds, recording his second career double-double.  Miles Plumlee  scored nine points and grabbed seven rebounds, while  Markieff Morris  came off the bench for nine points and six rebounds. 
 The Suns set new team marks for most points allowed and fewest points scored in a game this season. The 29-point loss is their largest margin of defeat this season. Phoenix also shot a season-low .360 from the field and .174 from 3-point range. 
 Curry had 14 points, nine rebounds and nine assists in the first half and secured his second triple-double of the season long before the third quarter ended. His previous career high for rebounds was 11 and for assists was 15. 
 The Warriors held Phoenix to 36.0 percent shooting from the field. That marks the 13th time this season the Warriors have held an opponent to under 40.0 percent shooting. 
 
 QUOTABLE:   "Uncharacteristic. Very weird. ( Andrew Bogut ) and D. Lee were keeping the bigs off the glass. As guards, our job is to control the long rebounds. They shoot a lot of 3's obviously. I was just coming back, helping our bigs out, and I was able to snag a lot of boards early."  
 --  Stephen Curry  on setting a career-high for rebounds 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Golden State and Phoenix, two of the NBA's best 3-point shooting teams, combined to go 3-for-22 from long range in the first half. The Warriors made two of 11 3-point shots while the Suns made one of 11. The Suns finished 4-for-23 from 3-point range, and the Warriors shot 8-for-20. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Leading 34-32 with just under eight minutes left in the second quarter, the Warriors closed out the half on a 25-8 run to build a 59-40 lead. Thompson started the run with five quick points on a three-point play and a 20-foot jump shot.  Andre Iguodala  hit a jumper, and Lee followed with a three-point play, giving the Warriors 10 unanswered points before Plumlee scored inside with just over five minutes left. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It was spectacular. Awfully impressive running a team. Kept his foot on the gas pedal. Rebounded the basketball. Defended at a high level. Made shots. I mean, the guy is playing at an all-time level for himself, and that's saying a lot. He's been spectacular and continued it tonight. I just loved the way he competed." 
 -- Warriors coach  Mark Jackson  on Curry 
 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "Game 28 is the first egg we've laid for the season. So you're going to have those games every once in a while. I think they came out ready to play. They really attacked us, and we were slow to everything. Offensively we were slow to get in our spots to run off our sets. They pushed us anywhere they wanted. And we were trying to execute plays from 30 feet out rather than the 16 of 17 feet out we should be, so they just took it to us." 
 -- Suns coach  Jeff Hornacek 
 
 
 HOT:  Thompson topped the 20-point mark for the second straight game as he continued fighting his way out of a shooting slump. He shot 9-for-11 from the field and 2-for-3 from long range. Thompson picked up his third foul with six minutes left in the first quarter, but he made the most of his 24-plus minutes on the court. 
 
 NOT:  The Suns'  Channing Frye  and  Gerald Green  each went 1-for-5 from 3-point range. In the victory over Golden State on Dec. 15, Frye went 5-for-7 from long range and the Suns made 13 of 27 3-point shots. 
 
 QUOTABLE IV:  "Contrary to popular belief, we're a very good defensive team. We take pride in it."  
 --  Mark Jackson 
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Curry has now gone four straight games scoring under 19 points, but he has racked up 44 assists and 28 rebounds during that span, helping the Warriors win four straight games. 
 
 NOTABLE:   The Warriors had 56 rebounds, grabbing at least 50 in a game for the league-high 12th time. ... Golden State's bench scored a season-high 47 points, outscoring the Suns' reserves by five points. ... Curry went just 1-for-6 from long range, but he tied Jackson on the NBA's all-time list for 121st place with 734 3-point baskets. ... Curry's 16 assists were the most by a Warrior since  Tim Hardaway  had 19 on Jan. 8, 1990. ... The Suns fell to 7-2 in Friday night games. ... Bogut and Lee had each grabbed at least 10 rebounds in consecutive games before Friday. Lee had seven rounds and Bogut six against Phoenix.
