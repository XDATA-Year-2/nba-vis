 THE FACTS: Jarrett Jack  wasn't re-signed by the New Orleans Hornets in the offseason after leading the team one season ago. Saturday night, Jack made them pay, clinching a 116-112 win for the Golden State Warriors over the Hornets. He scored seven straight points in the final 52 seconds and finished with 25 points and 12 assists. Jack also went 10-for-11 from the free-throw line to pace Golden State. 
 The Warriors (24-15) were able to grab the road win in spite of being outrebounded 37-33 and allowing the Hornets to shoot 57 percent from the floor. The Hornets (13-27) took a 110-108 lead after  Eric Gordon  and  Anthony Davis  made three consecutive free throws. But then Jack took over, culling fouls from two different players on three different possessions to get him to the line. 
 Gordon led New Orleans with 23 points while Davis had 20 points and 12 rebounds.  Ryan Anderson  scored 19 off the bench. New Orleans had been the hot team, winning six of seven heading into the game while the Warriors were coming off of a loss at San Antonio a night earlier and played without  David Lee , who injured his left ankle against the Spurs. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "People tend to say you play with a chip on your shoulder when you play against your old team or whatever the case may be. But I play with a chip on my shoulder all the time. Nothing has ever been given to me in this league."  
 --The Warriors' Jarrett Jack 
 
 THE STAT : 56.5 -- That's the Hornets' shooting percentage from the free-throw line. In spite of taking seven fewer free throws than Golden State actually sank, New Orleans could have picked up its seventh win in eight games if it had gone better than 13-for-23 from the charity stripe. 
 
 TURNING POINT : The game turned on one back-to-back possession with less than a minute to play. Golden State inbounded the ball to Jack, who freed himself for an 11-foot jumper. On the ensuing Hornets possession, Jack coerced New Orleans'  Greivis Vasquez  into a foul that put the Warriors point guard back on the line. He went 1-for-2 and the Hornets were never back within three points again. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "We lost our identity tonight. We gave up 116 points to a team that is undermanned."  
 -- Hornets coach  Monty Williams 
 
 
 HOT : The Warriors'  Klay Thompson  couldn't seem to be stopped in the first half. His 24 points on 10-for-14 shooting in just 19 minutes paced Golden State to a 10-point halftime lead and helped the Warriors build a one-time 16-point lead early in the game. 
 
 BAD MOVE :  The Hornets were in the game in the first quarter as long as Vasquez and Gordon were on the floor. But the moment Williams took both out, the first half began to fall apart. The duo was not on the floor beginning with 1:07 to play in the first quarter and the Hornets trailing just 27-26. By the time both returned with 7:13 to go in the second, the Warriors were up by seven and momentum had totally switched. 
 
 NOTABLE : Jack's 25 points and 12 assists on Saturday means for the first time in his career he recorded back-to-back games with at least 20 points and 10 assists, which he had against the Spurs one game earlier. ... New Orleans' 57-percent shooting, 45 made field goals and 112 points were season highs for a home game. ... Golden State's  Festus Ezeli  recorded a career-high 13 points. He also grabbed eight rebounds. ... New Orleans Saints coaches Joe Vitt and Steve Spagnuolo attended the game. 
 
 UP NEXT :  For the Hornets, Monday vs. Sacramento, Wednesday @ San Antonio, Friday vs. Houston. For the Warriors, Monday vs. Clippers, Wednesday vs. Oklahoma City, Friday @ Chicago.
