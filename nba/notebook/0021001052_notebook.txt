  Wizards-Trail Blazers notebook   By Kerry Eggers, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday March 23, 2011 1:53AM THE FACTS: Gerald Wallace  (28 points) led three Trail Blazers with 20 points or more as Portland destroyed Washington 111-76 Tuesday night at the Rose Garden.  Nicolas Batum  and  LaMarcus Aldridge  each scored 22 for the Blazers (41-30), who are in sixth place in the Western Conference, a game behind fifth-place Denver (42-29). Washington shot 37 percent from the field and was outrebounded 45-32. QUOTABLE:  "We want to play from the inside out. Tonight we did a better job of going to the post, playing off of LaMarcus and spacing our guys. Wallace was crashing the boards and diving to the basket."    -- Portland coach  Nate McMillan , on his team's front line outscoring its Wizard counterparts by a collective 72-24, and the Blazers scoring 62 points in the paint. THE STAT:  Portland dominated in points in the paint (62-40), second-chance points (23-11), fast-break points (19-10), recorded a season-high 14 steals and turned 27 Washington turnovers into 33 points. TURNING POINT:  The Blazers led 37-34 early in the second quarter when Batum and Aldridge keyed a 17-5 run that produced a 54-39 lead. The Wizards never challenged again. QUOTABLE II:  "I'm getting more comfortable with the guys out on the court, and they're getting more comfortable with me. Tonight, we were getting out and running. We scored in transition off turnovers and got to the basket. If we do that, it makes it a whole lot easier for everybody."    -- Gerald Wallace HOT:  Batum was 9-for-15 from the field, 2-for-4 from 3-point range and 2-for-2 at the line. Besides his 22 points, he contributed a game-high 12 rebounds, three assists and three steals in 40 minutes. NOT:  Washington's guards,  Jordan Crawford  and  John Wall , combined for 6-for-27 shooting. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Wallace filled up the stat sheet again with 28 points, eight rebounds, four steals and three assists in 33 minutes. Portland's starting power forward made 10 of 14 shots from the field. INSIDE THE ARENA:  The crowd of 20,624 was the 150th straight Rose Garden sellout (regular season and playoffs) dating to December 2007. GOOD MOVE:  Washington's  JaVale McGee  made one of the great defensive plays you'll ever see. Portland's  Wesley Matthews  was going in for a second-quarter dunk, but McGee caught him in mid-air and fleeced him of the ball one-handed. BAD MOVE:  Matthews, trying to dunk on McGee. "Give me my arm back," Matthews joked afterward. ROOKIE WATCH:  Washington's Rookie of the Year candidate, point guard John Wall, had nine points and seven assists but was just 3-for-12 from the field and had four turnovers. NOTABLE:  Aldridge scored 22 points in the first half, zero in the second. He didn't even attempt a shot in the third quarter and sat out the final period. The Wizards are 1-32 on the road. The NBA record for futility is Sacramento's 1-40 mark in 1990-91. UP NEXT:  For the Blazers, Friday vs. San Antonio, Sunday @ Oklahoma City, Monday @ San Antonio; For the Wizards, Wednesday @ L.A.
