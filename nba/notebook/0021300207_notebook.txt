 THE FACT:  The Nuggets improved to 41-9 when  Kenneth Faried , who scored 10 points and grabbed 10 rebounds, notches a double-double.  
 
 THE LEAD: Ty Lawson  scored 19 points and  J.J. Hickson  added 22 and eight rebounds to lead Denver to a 110-96 win, sending Dallas to its first home loss of the season Monday night at the American Airlines Center.  
 Denver (7-6) quickly erased an early 11-point deficit in the first quarter, as Hickson poured in 12 points to key a 24-8 run to finish the period, giving the Nuggets a lead they would not relinquish. After Dallas trimmed the margin to five at the end of the half, Denver widened the lead to as much as 15 in the third quarter behind 13 points from Lawson.  
 
 QUOTABLE I:  "I thought it was a good team win for our guys tonight. We got contributions from a lot of different places." 
 
 -- Nuggets coach  Brian Shaw 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Entering the game with the league's third highest scoring bench, Denver's reserves were at it again on Monday, outscoring the Mavericks' bench 41-21. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  After Dallas cut the Nuggets' lead to 89-85 midway through the fourth quarter,  Nate Robinson  quickly silenced the crowd with back-to-back 3-pointers from the corner to push the lead back to double-digits. Robinson scored 13 of his 17 points in the final quarter to preserve the win. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We didn't have much competitive energy tonight and the guys on the bench are the guys that have got to give it to us. This is a coaching loss. I didn't have these guys ready to play -- it's clear." 
 
 -- Mavericks coach  Rick Carlisle 
 
 
 HOT:  Denver's starters were on fire from the field in the third quarter, going 9-for-10 from the field. 
 
 NOT:  Vince Carter  struggled throughout the night, scoring just eight points on 3-for-13 shooting.

 NOTABLE:  Nowitzki passed Kevin Garnett (25,352) for 14th place on the all-time scoring list. Garnett will have his chance to reclaim the spot on Tuesday when the Nets take on the Raptors. ... Connecting on 4-of-5 attempts from the foul line, Nowitzki also passed  Reggie Miller  (6,237) for 13th place on the NBA's all-time free throws made list. ...  DeJuan Blair  earned his first start of the season, replacing  Samuel Dalembert ,  who was sidelined for missing shootaround after oversleeping. ... With the win, Denver pulled above .500 for the first time in 2013-14. ... Denver limited the Mavericks to just five 3-pointers on 19 attempts. ...
