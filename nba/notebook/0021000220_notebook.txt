  Wizards-Hawks notebook   By Jon Cooper, for NBA.com Posted Friday November 26, 2010 1:04AM THE FACTS:  The Atlanta Hawks made a point of coming out with energy on Thursday night and made quick work of the Washington Wizards, beating the Wizards, 116-96, at Philips Arena.  Joe Johnson  scored a game-high 21 points and  Josh Smith  and  Al Horford  combined for 35 points and 27 rebounds as Atlanta beat Washington for the 11th straight time and the sixth straight on their home floor.  Gilbert Arenas  led the Wizards with 21 and  Nick Young  chipped in with 20. The Wizards are now 0-7 away from home. QUOTABLE:  "Joe looked like the Joe of old."   --  Hawks coach  Larry Drew  on Johnson . THE STAT:  16-2: The Hawks, who came into Thursday's game concerned about Washington's ability to score in transition, turned the tables, outscoring the Wizards, 16-2 in fastbreak points, in the first quarter, when they broke the game open, and 32-15 for the game. TURNING POINT:  Following a  Kirk Hinrich  jumper with 8:24 left in the first quarter that gave the Wizards an 8-7 lead, Atlanta went on a 14-2 run to go ahead, 21-10. The Hawks, played downhill the rest of the way, leading by ten after one, by 17 at the half, by 26 after three and cruising to the 20-point victory. Smith scored six of the points in the run, which saw five different Hawks score. QUOTABLE II:  "We worked really hard. I think our meeting went well and that was the key. We addressed a lot of issues we had as a team. I kind of wanted to go out there and show it, I didn't want to talk about it before the game. We did that tonight and I'm happy to get this win."   --  Horford, who shot 6-for-11, had 15 points and 13 rebounds, including a game-high seven offensive boards HOT:  Johnson shot .500 (8-for-16) for the first time in six games and hit three three-point field goals for the first time this season (3-for-5). Johnson is shooting .461 (18-for-39) in two games against Washington and .500 from three (5-for-10). NOT:  Arenas led Washington in scoring, but 10 of his 21 points came in the fourth quarter, when the game was no longer in doubt. In the first half, he shot 2-for-9, 1-for-5 from three. He and back court mate  John Wall  were a combined 2-for 15, 1-for-7 from three in the first half. The Wizards made only one three-point shot in 10 tries in the first half. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Smith continues to fill up the stat sheet. He had 20 points and 14 rebounds, while dishing out five assists, blocking two shots and making two steals. For Washington, Young scored 20 points (13 after three). Over the last six games, Young has averaged 17 points a game. That shoots up to 19.4 if you take away the November 19 game at Memphis, where he scored only five. GOOD MOVE:  Coach Drew called a team meeting on Wednesday. The team cleared the air, re-focused and, most important for the Hawks, re-energized. ROOKIE WATCH:   Wall, who lit up Atlanta in his second pro game, scoring 28 points on 9-of-17 shooting, managed only 10 points, shooting 3-for-12, and was 0-for-3 from three. Wall didn't score his first basket until midway through the third quarter. By then, Washington was down by 21. He didn't play in the fourth quarter. Atlanta rookie  Jordan Crawford  shot .500 from the floor and had nine points in a little less than 15 minutes, mostly in the fourth quarter. NOTABLE:  Atlanta, which had been outscored 70-34 in the first quarter the last two games, held a 28-18 lead after one. The 18 points the Hawks allowed was a season-low for an opponent in a first quarter...Horford was three-for-three from the free throw line and has now converted his last 18 attempts. He hasn't missed from the line since the end of Atlanta's Nov. 12 game against Utah, a string of six straight games...Arenas pulled down his 2,000th career rebound and made his 1,000th career three-point shot...Washington center  JaVale McGee  continued his streak of blocking at least one shot in every game this season... Jamal Crawford  made his 2,000th career free throw in the second quarter. UP NEXT:  For the Hawks, Saturday @ New York, Sunday @ Toronto, Wednesday vs. Memphis. For the Wizards, Saturday vs. Orlando, Monday @ Miami, Wednesday @ Toronto.
