 THE FACT:  Minnesota used a 13-4 run to end the third quarter, pushing its lead to 84-77 entering the fourth quarter. With the win, the Timberwolves are now 9-0 when leading after three quarters. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Every Minnesota starter scored in double figures, led by 27 points from  Kevin Martin , as the Timberwolves downed the Dallas Mavericks 112-106 Saturday night at the American Airlines Center. 
 
 Kevin Love  recorded a double-double with 21 points and 11 rebounds and  Nikola Pekovic  also chipped in 21 points to help the Wolves (9-9) snap a three-game losing streak.  
 With  Jose Calderon  (bruised right ankle) inactive, Dallas (10-8) struggled to find a rhythm from beyond the arc, connecting on just 7-for-24 trey attempts.  Monta Ellis  led the way for the Mavericks, scoring 26 points and handing out six assists in the loss. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "We are in a tough stretch into December, so to get a win, especially on the road where we have had trouble these first several games, it feels good." 
 
 --Kevin Love 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The game was won at the charity stripe, as the Timberwolves hit 21-for-30 attempts from the line, while Dallas attempted just 11 free throws. 
 
 TURNING POINT : After a 7-2 Dallas run cut the Timberwolves lead to just 92-90, Minnesota rattled off an 11-2 run, led by nine points from Martin, to push the advantage back to double-digits.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We're going to learn about our team right now. Lose four out of five, have a tough loss like last night and then another tough one like tonight -- it's going to test the togetherness and the collective will." 
 
 --Mavericks coach  Rick Carlisle 
 
 
 HOT:  Pekovic abused  Samuel Dalembert  in the paint early, scoring 10 of Minnesota's first 17 points. ... Ellis kept Dallas within striking distance, scoring 11 of his team-high 26 points in the third quarter.  
 
 NOT: Vince Carter  continued to struggle from the field, shooting just 4-for-12 and amassing 10 points. In his last four games, Carter has shot just 10-for-45 from the floor. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  With Calderon out of action,  Gal Mekel  received his first career start and posted six points and a season-high seven assists in 26 minutes. The rookie struggled to find his shot, however, connecting on just 3-for-12 attempts. 
 
 NOTABLE : The win snapped a five-game road losing streak for the Timberwolves. ...  Shawn Marion  passed  Fat Lever  (1,666) for 20th pace on the NBA's all-time steals list. ... Ellis hit his 4,000th career field goal with a 3-pointer in the third quarter. ... Martin's streak of consecutive made free throws came to an end at 36.
