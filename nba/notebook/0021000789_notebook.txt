  Spurs-Sixers notebook   By Andy Jasner. for NBA.com Posted Friday February 11, 2011 11:05PM THE FACTS:   Jrue Holiday  scored 27 points and knocked down four clutch free throws in the final 30 seconds to give the Sixers a huge 77-71 win over the San Antonio Spurs on Friday.  Spencer Hawes  had 13 points and eight rebounds while  Elton Brand  swept 17 rebounds, tying his season high. The Sixers shot just 35 percent while the Spurs hit just 33 percent of their shots -- 27-for-81.  Tim Duncan  scored 16 points and grabbed 13 rebounds.  Antonio McDyess  had 11 points and 11 rebounds off the bench and reserve guard  Gary Neal  scored 11 points. The Spurs fell to 44-9, but still hold the best record in the league. QUOTABLE:  "What a marvelous win for our team. For us to beat the best team in the league, our guys are very, very happy."  -  Sixers coach  Doug Collins. THE STAT:   Tony Parker  (3-for-10) and  Manu Ginobili  (2-for-10) shot a combined 5-for-20. TURNING POINT:  The Sixers clamped down on defense and didn't allow the Spurs to score a point in the final 2:05. HOT:  McDyess was 5-for-7 from the field and gave the Spurs a nice spark off the bench. NOT:   Andre Iguodala  couldn't find his rhythm for the Sixers. He missed 11 of his first 13 shots wound up 2-for-15. QUOTABLE II:  "We played great defense and hit big shots when we had to."  -  Brand. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  In addition to his 27 points, Holiday contributed five rebounds, three steals and two assists. INSIDE THE ARENA:  For the second consecutive home game, the crowd was energetic. That makes sense considering the Orlando Magic visited Wednesday followed by the Spurs on Friday. Sixers Chairman  Ed Snider  sat in his customary front-row seat courtside. QUOTABLE III:  "In the end, they made some plays to win."  -  Spurs coach  Gregg Popovich  on the Sixers. GOOD MOVE:  The Sixers put the ball in Holiday's hands more often in the fourth quarter and didn't run Iguodala at the point forward position as much. BAD MOVE:  The Spurs didn't run enough plays for  Matt Bonner , who is an outstanding 3-point shooter. Bonner took just one shot all night -- a 3-pointer -- and connected. ROOKIE WATCH:   Evan Turner , the Sixers' No. 2 overall pick from Ohio State, scored four points in 16 minutes. Turner suffered a muscle spasm in Wednesday's loss to Orlando, but he was deemed healthy to play against the Spurs. NOTABLE:  The Spurs outrebounded the Sixers, 57-46. DID YOU NOTICE:  Brand had a rare scoreless first half for the Sixers. But he did grab eight rebounds and finished with a team-high 17, 16 off the defensive glass. DEFENSE WINS:  The Sixers won despite scoring just 77 points, one shy of tying their season low. They had scored at least 94 points in the last 18 straight games, their longest stretch since a 27-game streak from Nov. 28, 1990 - Jan. 25, 1991.
