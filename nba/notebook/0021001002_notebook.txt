  Mavericks-Blazers notebook   By Kerry Eggers, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday March 16, 2011 1:29AM THE FACTS:   LaMarcus Aldridge  scored 30 points and grabbed eight rebounds as the Trail Blazers knocked off Dallas 104-101 Tuesday night at the Rose Garden.  Brandon Roy  added 21 points off the bench for Portland (38-29), which moved into a virtual tie for sixth place with New Orleans (39-30) in the Western Conference.  Dirk Nowitzki  led the Mavericks (47-20) with 28 point and 11 boards, but missed a 3-pointer in the final seconds that could have forced overtime. QUOTABLE:  "Dallas is a really good team. [The Mavericks] were shooting so well in the first half. I was really impressed with our guys staying with it, not giving in, not giving up. We've been talking about challenging each other, encouraging each other, staying together. The guys did that tonight and found a way to get this win."    -- Portland coach  Nate McMillan . THE STAT:  Dallas made its first 11 shots from the field and shot .597 -- and still lost. TURNING POINT:  Portland led 96-94 when Marcus Camby tipped in Roy's driving layup --  Marcus Camby 's only basket of the game. That was followed by  Rudy Fernandez 's steal and pass to Aldridge for a run-out dunk and a 100-94 lead with 3:51 remainin. QUOTABLE II:  "You were like the '08-09 B-Roy tonight."    --  Wesley Matthews  to Roy, working his way back after January arthroscopic surgery on both knees. HOT:  Roy was 7-for-10 and scored 17 of his 21 points in the second half. NOT:  Portland's  Andre Miller  made only 2-for-9 shots, making him 2-for-17 over the last two games. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Aldridge (30 points, eight rebounds, one assist, one steal) and Nowitzki (28 points, 11 rebounds, two assists) were a virtual draw on the stat board. INSIDE THE ARENA:  The Trail Blazers partnered with Mercy Corps to collect donations, raising $15,000 from fans during tonight's game to help provide disaster relief for earthquake victims in Japan. Owner  Paul Allen  added $25,000, making Portland's contribution $40,000. BAD MOVE:  With Portland ahead 94-90 in the final minutes,  Gerald Wallace  fed Fernandez, who was wide open at the 3-point line. Fernandez passed up the shot, and the possession resulted in a turnover and a  Shawn Marion  basket at the other end. GOOD MOVE:  Moments later, Fernandez got a steal in the open court and fed LaMarcus Aldridge for a dunk and a 100-94 advantage. NOTABLE:  Portland had 18 more shot attempts (85-67) than Dallas. The Blazers also scored 22 points off of 15 Dallas turnovers; the Mavericks scored eight points off seven Blazer giveaways. UP NEXT:  For the Blazers, Cleveland Thursday, Philadelphia Saturday, at L.A. Lakers Sunday. For the Mavericks, at Golden State Wednesday, San Antonio Friday, Golden State Sunday.
