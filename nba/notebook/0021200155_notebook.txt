 THE FACTS:  The New York Knicks earned their seventh win by double digits, coasting to a 102-80 win over the New Orleans Hornets on the first night of a three-game road swing.  Carmelo Anthony  led the Knicks with 29 points, 23 coming in the first half, and New York (8-1) outrebounded New Orleans by 13 as the Hornets (3-6) were forced to play without rookie  Anthony Davis , who is day-to-day with an ankle injury. 
 The Knicks, who entered the game averaging 26 3-point attempts per game, fired off 36 and it paid dividends. New York converted 14, helping the Knicks score all but 18 of their 102 points from outside the paint. New Orleans cut the Knicks halftime lead to four points less than two minutes into the third quarter, but then New York went on a run that never really ended.  J.R. Smith  and  Raymond Felton  both scored 15 points and former Hornet  Tyson Chandler  had 12 rebounds to go with seven points. 
 For New Orleans,  Ryan Anderson 's 15 points on 6-for-14 shooting was a team high.  Brian Roberts  added 13 off the bench. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Every single night has to be our style of basketball. We've got to be willing to lose playing our style. Win or lose, we've got to ride the same way every single night. Then you know we can walk in this locker room feeling OK. It has to be consistent every game." 
 -- Knicks' Tyson Chandler 
 
 THE STAT:  100 -- For the fourth straight game, the Hornets allowed at least 100 points. And New Orleans is 0-4 in that stretch. The slide has happened as the Hornets have gone from allowing 83.5 point per game over the first four games to 105.6 the past five. The Hornets haven't allowed 100 points in four straight games since April 2010. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Ryan Anderson hit a 20-foot shot to pull New Orleans to within 56-52 early in the third quarter. And then the Knicks went on a run. Anthony hit two free throws, and then followed them up with a jumper. A minute later,  Ronnie Brewer  sank a 3-pointer and Chandler hit a free throw and the Knicks were suddenly up 64-52. The Hornets never cut the deficit to fewer than 10 after that. 
 
 HOT:  Anthony entered Tuesday night's game averaging more than 23 points. He had that in the first half thanks to a scorching first quarter, when he shot 8-for-9, including 2-for-3 from 3-point range. He finished the first quarter with 19 points on his way to a game-high 29. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We've got to get it together. It's hurting us. It's four losses in a row. You don't want to take that. You don't want to get used to losing."  
 --Hornets guard  Greivis Vasquez 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  In the second quarter, Hornets coach  Monty Williams  chose to play a smaller, guard-based lineup and it worked. New Orleans cut a 14-point deficit down. New Orleans outscored the Knicks 31-24 in the second 12 minutes. Ultimately, New York's outside shooting was enough to overcome this move. 
 
 NOTABLE:  New York's 36 3-point attempts tied an NBA season high, set by the Knicks on Nov. 2 against Miami. ... Anthony's 29 points gave him at least 20 points in eight of New York's nine games this season. ...  Spike Lee  was in attendance to watch the Knicks play a road game. ... The Hornets failed to reach 90 points for the fourth time this season. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Hornets, Wednesday @ Indiana, Friday @ Phoenix, Sunday @ Denver. For the Knicks, Wednesday @ Dallas, Friday @ Houston, Sunday vs. Detroit.
