  Notebook: Wolves 106, Blazers 94 Posted Wednesday March 7, 2012 11:34PM By Jim Beilby, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  After losing 16 straight games to the Portland Trail Blazers, the Minnesota Timberwolves have now defeated them twice in the last four days.  Kevin Love  had another huge night, with 29 points and 16 rebounds as Minnesota clawed out a 106-94 victory over Portland on Wednesday night.  Luke Ridnour  and  Wes Johnson  also made big contributions to the cause, scoring 22 and 19 points respectively.  The victory is Minnesota's fifth straight at home and it is now winners of eight of its last 11 games. As a result of their strong play of late, if the playoffs were to start tomorrow, the surprising Minnesota Timberwolves would get in. QUOTABLE:  "That's great, but it doesn't mean anything right now. We have a couple of big games coming up and we need to focus on them."   -- Kevin Love on the Wolves climbing into the eighth spot in the West THE STAT:  Minnesota made a season-high 13 3-pointers (13-for-23, 56.5 percent). Its previous season high was achieved four days ago, in Portland where the Wolves shot 12-for-23 (52.2). In between those two games, Minnesota played the Clippers and dropped 11 treys on them. That's 36 made 3-pointers in the last three games. TURNING POINT:  After leading by as many as 14 in the third quarter, Minnesota saw Portland cut their lead to six points with 4:14 to play in the game. Ridnour's response was the drain a 3-pointer, make a pair of free throws, and assist a monstrous dunk by rookie  Derrick Williams  and a 3-pointer by  Martell Webster , all part of a 10-2 run that put the Trailblazers away for good. HOT:  The Wolves 3-point shooting (see above). NOT:  Blazers' 3-point shooting. Portland was 3-for-23 from beyond the arc. NOTABLE:  With their win Wednesday, Minnesota improves to 21-19, matching its best record after 40 games since the 2003-04 season .. After scoring a season-high 40 points in the first quarter four days ago in Portland, Minnesota scored 37 in the first quarter Wednesday, including 16 in the opening frame from Love .. Portland has now lost four of its last five games (with its lone victory coming on Monday over New Orleans); they have also lost four of their last five road games, an ominous sign for a team which just played the first game of a seven game road trip .. While he just missed 30 points Wednesday, Kevin Love has more 30-point/10-rebound games this season (13) than  Kevin Durant  (five),  LeBron James  (four), and  Dwight Howard  (three) combined (12). UP NEXT:  For the Wolves, Friday vs. L.A. Lakers, Saturday vs. New Orleans, Monday @ Phoenix. For the Blazers, Friday @ Boston, Saturday @ Washington, Tuesday @ Indiana.
