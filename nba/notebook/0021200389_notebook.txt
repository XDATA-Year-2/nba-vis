 THE FACTS:   David Lee  had had his third career triple-double with 23 points, 11 rebounds and a career-high 11 assists, leading the Golden State Warriors to a 115-100 victory Friday night over the Charlotte Bobcats at Oracle Arena.  
 
 Stephen Curry  scored a game-high 27 points for the Warriors (18-9) and made a career-high eight 3-pointers, breaking his previous mark of seven that he tied Wednesday night at Sacramento. Curry became the first Warrior in franchise history to make at least seven 3s in back-to-back games. He's the first NBA player to accomplish that feat since  J.R. Smith  with Denver in April 2009. 
 
 Klay Thompson  added 20 points, while  Draymond Green  scored a career-high 11 and  Jarrett Jack  added 11 for the Warriors, who bounced back from Wednesday night's 131-127 loss to the Kings. 
 Lee had his first triple-double with the New York Knicks against the Warriors and his past two for Golden State. 
 The Bobcats (7-19) lost their 14th straight game, the NBA's longest current skid. They haven't won since Nov. 24 when they beat Washington 108-106 in double overtime and matched their victory total from last season. 
 
 Gerald Henderson  led the Bobcats with a season-high 23 points, while  Ramon Sessions  had 17 and  Kemba Walker  16.  Bismark Biyombo  had a double-double with a season-high 14 rebounds and 12 points, and  Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  scored 12 points. 
 Lee was well on his way to a triple-double by halftime. He had 17 points, seven rebounds and three assists. 
 The Warriors beat the Bobcats for the second time in 11 days.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "He had an amazing game. Obviously he's a scoring threat on the low post an even the mid-range jump shot. He had it all going tonight. When he draws attention and is able to get in the creases and make plays and kick out, we got to be ready to take good shots and make him look good." 
 -- Stephen Curry on David Lee 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Warriors shot 51.9 percent from 3-point range, making 14-for-27 attempts  -- both season highs -- while Charlotte shot 38.1 percent from long range, going 8-for-21. Charlotte shot just .367 from the field, the lowest percentage by a Warriors opponent this season. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Warriors led just 49-47 with 2:40 left in the first half and had squandered most of their 14-point lead. But Golden State finished the half on a 9-2 run to grab a 58-49 lead at the intermission.  Harrison Barnes  hit a pair from the line, Thompson nailed a jumper, Lee tipped in a Thompson miss and Curry drained a long 3-point shot during the surge. The Warriors never led by fewer than nine points the rest of the game. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It's tough, it's tough. To play as hard as we play at times and then still come up short. But at the same time, we're still a young team, we're still trying to learn this game, we're still trying to become a better team. We're still getting better as the season's going on. That's all we can really think about right now." 
 -- Bobcats'  Kemba Walker  on the 14-game losing streak. 
 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Green had a strong all-around game off the bench for Golden State with 11 points, four assists, two rebounds and a block. Coming off a game at Phoenix in which he scored 25 points and grabbed 12 rebounds -- tying his career highs -- Kidd-Gilchrist put up solid but not spectacular numbers. He six rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block to go with his 12 points. 
 
 HOT:   Curry and Walker were on fire in the first half. Walker drilled 4-for-5 from beyond the arc and scored 16 first-half points. Curry made 5-for-7 from long range and scored 15. 
 
 NOT:  Walker went ice cold in a scoreless second half. He missed both of his 3-pointers and all six of his shots from the field. Bobcats starting forward  Byron Mullens  went 0-for-6 for the night. He entered the game shooting .375 from the field. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Lee continued putting up remarkable numbers. He scored over 20 points for the 11th straight time, setting another career high.  
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  New York Yankees left-hander  C.C. Sabathia , a Bay Area native from Vallejo, attended the game and sat courtside. Sabathia, the American League Cy Young Award winner in 2007 as a Cleveland Indian, won a World Series with the Yankees in 2009. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Warriors are off to their best start through 27 games since 1991-92 when they were 19-8. ... Golden State improved to 17-2 when outrebounding its opponent. ... Bobcats backup guard  Ben Gordon  missed the game with a sore right knee. Charlotte coach  Mike Dunlap  said the move was precautionary and that he didn't expect Gordon to miss much time. He's averaging 12.8 points per game. ... The Warriors improved to 11-2 against Eastern Conference teams ... Warriors backup center  Andris Biedrins  had three of his team's season-high nine blocked shots. He also had seven rebounds and two points. ... Thompson had his 20th career game with at least 20 points. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Bobcats, Saturday @ Denver, Wednesday vs. Miami, Friday at Brooklyn. For the Warriors, Saturday vs. L.A. Lakers, Wednesday @ Utah, Friday vs. Philadelphia.
