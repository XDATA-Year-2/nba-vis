 THE FACTS : The Los Angeles Lakers had their first road victory of the season locked up early, leading by as many as 37 points en route to a 115-89 defeat of the Dallas Mavericks on Saturday night at the American Airlines Center.  Kobe Bryant, Metta World Peace  and  Antawn Jamison  each scored 19 points as the Lakers (7-7) improved to 2-2 under coach  Mike D'Antoni . 
 Not looking anything like a team playing its fourth game in five nights, or one that was 0-4 away from home, the Lakers repeatedly blew past defenders for layups, shot 55 percent (12-for-22) from 3-point range and dominated Dallas (7-7) from start to finish. The Mavericks shot 37 percent from the field and got dominated on the glass, 61-39.  Vince Carter  led Dallas with 16 points off the bench. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "When we can get him at the four, it opens up his game. He's one of the best slashers and cutters. He's dangerous from 3. He's a player. I think he's hitting his stride now and he feels reborn a little bit, and we'll keep helping him." 
 -- Mike D'Antoni on Antawn Jamison, who added a game-high 15 rebounds 
 
 THE STAT : The Lakers' 65 points in the first half were the most against the Mavericks in any half this season, topping the 58 points allowed at Utah on Oct. 31. Los Angeles was 8-for-10 from 3-point range in the half.  
 
 TURNING POINT : Any chance the Mavericks had of making it a contest evaporated quickly in the second quarter. Dallas narrowed the gap to 49-34 on a 3-pointer by rookie  Jae Crowder , but the Lakers answered with a 16-4 run to finish the half. Bryant scored 11 points during that stretch, including a 3-pointer with 1.9 seconds left before the break. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "When we were 4-1 it wasn't a problem and we're not going to make it a problem." 
 --Mavericks coach  Rick Carlisle  on playing without  Dirk Nowitzki 
 
 
 HOT : World Peace sank his first six shots, including four 3-pointers, and scored 16 points in the first quarter. He scored the Lakers' first 10 points of the game. His five 3-pointers in the game matched a career high. 
 
 NOT : Mavericks point guard  Darren Collison  was 1-for-10 from the field and finished with more turnovers (four) than points (two). Center  Chris Kaman  was 2-for-12 and finished with more fouls (six) than points (four). 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT : Jamison had a double-double by halftime with 11 points and 11 rebounds off the bench. ...  Dwight Howard  had 15 points, seven rebounds, a career high-tying five steals, two blocks and two assists. ... One night after being benched for the entire fourth quarter in a loss at Memphis,  Pau Gasol  contributed 13 points, nine rebounds and three assists. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA : Including the postseason, this was the 500th consecutive sellout at the AAC, the longest active streak in the NBA. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH : Crowder scored a season-high 15 points and had four rebounds, four steals and two assists. He was 3-for-7 from behind the arc. 
 
 NOTABLE : It was the 1,000th career game for Carter, the 104th player to reach that milestone. ... The Lakers have won the last four regular-season meetings in Dallas. ... The Mavericks are 7-0 this season when shooting at least 45 percent from the field and 0-7 when they don't. ... Lakers forward  Devin Ebanks  played for the first time since he was arrested on Nov. 9 for suspicion of misdemeanor DUI, scoring five points in five-plus minutes. ...  O.J. Mayo  scored 13 for Dallas, ending a streak of 11 straight games with 18-plus points. ... The Mavericks' only lead was 4-3. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Mavericks, Tuesday @ Philadelphia, Wednesday @ Chicago, Saturday vs. Detroit. For the Lakers, Tuesday vs. Indiana, Friday vs. Denver, Dec. 2 vs. Orlando.
