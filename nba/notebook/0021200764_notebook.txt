 THE FACTS :  The Brooklyn Nets beat the Indiana Pacers 89-84 in overtime on Monday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. Indiana led 76-72 with 1:38 left, but missed its final four shots of regulation as the Nets rallied to force overtime thanks to  Joe Johnson 's tough driving floater with 13 seconds remaining. New Jersey (30-22) then dominated the extra session to win going away. It was the Nets' ninth consecutive overtime win, and fourth this season.  Brook Lopez  was dominant for the Nets, who played without injured point guard  Deron Williams , racking up 25 points and eight rebounds. Johnson scored 17 while  Reggie Evans  yanked 22 rebounds.  George Hill  led Indiana (31-21) with 22 points. 
 
 QUOTABLE :  "We played, we got down, we hustled, we got to the free-throw line and we battled them on the boards. They had us. The big deficit was early but we kind of worked our way back in. The only good thing about getting killed by San Antonio [Sunday] was the next day we beat one of the better teams in the league."  
 -- Nets coach  P.J. Carlesimo 
 
 
 THE STAT :  Indiana has lost consecutive home games for the first time since Feb. 11 and 14, 2012 -- almost a full calendar year. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Indiana trailed 70-64 with 6:15 remaining, but Hill sparked a 12-2 run with three buckets, including a steal and layup that put the Pacers ahead 76-72 with 1:38 remaining. But the Pacers shot 2-for-14 thereafter to let the game slip away.  Tyshawn Taylor  hit two difficult buckets late in the shot clock to put the Nets ahead to stay in overtime.  
 
 QUOTABLE II : "We were definitely desperate after dropping our last two games. We wanted to come out tonight and make a statement."  
 --   Joe Johnson 
 
 GOOD MOVE : With  David West  bothered by a scratched left eye sustained early in the first quarter, Indiana coach  Frank Vogel  went with little-used reserve power forward  Jeff Pendergraph  for extended minutes in the second quarter. He responded with 10 points and seven rebounds in the period as the Pacers wiped out a 10-point deficit to take a five-point lead at halftime. Pendergraph finished with a season-high 14 points and 10 rebounds. 
 
 BAD MOVE : The Pacers had the opportunity for the last shot in regulation, but Hill dribbled it away. With 13 seconds remaining, the Nets had a foul to give, but Hill let nine seconds elapse before starting his move to the bucket and was fouled immediately. That left the Pacers just 3.2 seconds to get the final shot, a forced left-handed runner that West missed at the buzzer. 
 
 HOT : Two players whose roles were expanded in the absence of Williams came through for the Nets, as Taylor scored a career-high 12 points on 5-for-9 shooting and  Marshon Brooks  had nine points on 4-for-8 shooting in 15 minutes. Pendergraph was 7-for-11 in his biggest game of the year. ... Hill ( 9 -for-18) and  Lance Stephenson  (6-for-12) were the only Indiana starters to hit at least half their shots. 
 
 NOT : Indiana's three current and former All-Stars combined to shoot 8-for-39 (.205) as  Paul George  shot 1-for-10, West 2-for-11 and  Roy Hibbert  5-for-18. ... The Nets' two leading scorers, Lopez and Johnson, combined to shoot 14-for-36 (.389), which was torrid in comparison. 
 
 QUOTABLE III : "It's like creepy déjà vu."  
 -- Jeff Pendergraph on the Pacers' last two losses 
 
 NOTABLE : The Nets expect to regain the services of Williams after the All-Star break. Williams had Platement Rich Plasma injections in both ankles Monday in an effort to alleviate chronic pain. Nets general manager  Billy King  said the decision was made to have Williams receive the treatment because it would allow a full week for the start point guard to recover. He also said Williams should be good to go after the break. ... The Pacers hope to regain the services of their injured star,  Danny Granger , for either Wednesday's game against Charlotte or immediately after the All-Star break. Granger, out all season with left knee tendinosis, participated in a full practice Sunday. Whenever Granger returns, he will come off the bench until he rebuilds his conditioning and rhythm before returning to the lineup, with Stephenson ticketed for the second unit ... Indiana shot just 34.4 percent and was 5-for-22 (.227) from the 3-point line. ... Three of the Pacers' last four losses have come in overtime. ... Despite his poor shooting night, Hibbert had his 12th double-double with 12 points and 10 rebounds. 
 
 UP NEXT :  For the Pacers, Wednesday vs. Charlotte, Feb. 20 vs. New York, Feb. 22 vs. Detroit. For the Nets, Wednesday vs. Denver, Feb. 19 vs. Milwaukee, Feb. 20 @ Milwaukee.
