 THE FACTS: Al Horford  banked in a short half-hook from the right block with 5.9 seconds left, giving the Atlanta Hawks a 103-102 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks Saturday night at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. 
 Horford capped a 23-point, 11-rebound night as the Hawks (31-23) overcame a 10-point deficit in the last 6:43 to win for the fourth time in their last five games.  
 
 Jeff Teague  also scored 23 points and dished out nine assists, and  Josh Smith , the subject of intense trade rumors with the Bucks before the trading deadline, added 15 points, 13 rebounds and five assists. 
 
 Ersan Ilyasova  led the Bucks with 19 points and nine rebounds and  J.J. Redick  had 16 points in his Milwaukee debut. But they couldn't stop the reeling Bucks (26-28) from losing for the ninth time in 11 games. 
 
 Monta Ellis  (14 points, 10 assists) gave the Bucks a 102-101 lead with 10.8 seconds left with a running scoop layup down the right side of the lane, but after a timeout, Horford backed down Milwaukee's  Larry Sanders  and made his game-winner. Milwaukee had no timeouts left, and Ellis' running 15-footer hit off the back rim at the buzzer. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "We were trying to go to  Devin [Harris] . I was trying to give Devin a handoff and they played that real well, so my second option was to face and try to go. I know he was conscious of not fouling and I went ahead and made a strong play to the basket." 
 -- Al Horford on his game-winning shot 
 
 THE STAT : The Hawks went 14-for-28 on 3-pointers on the night, to just 4-for-12 for the Bucks. Every time Milwaukee built a bit of a lead, the Hawks had an answer from beyond the arc. 
 
 TURNING POINT : A  Brandon Jennings  jumper with 3:30 left gave the Bucks a 100-93 lead, but Harris made his fourth 3-pointer of the night with 2:12 left, and Smith made his second of the night with 1:56 left to make it a one-point game. A lob dunk by Horford with 1:28 left gave the Hawks their first lead of the final quarter and set up the finish. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "Our scouting report said to get in there and kick it. Just keep driving it in and kicking it. [Larry Sanders] is a talented player and he's going to make plays on the ball, so we just wanted to drive and kick it and we made shots tonight." 
 -- Jeff Teague on the Hawks' ability to avoid the Bucks' shot blockers 
 
 HOT : Ilyasova made 9 of his 10 shots in the first 42 minutes. 
 
 NOT : Ilyasova went 0-for-5 over the final six minutes, with the first two of them being blocked by Horford. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA : University of Wisconsin basketball coach Bo Ryan was in the stands. Ryan coached Hawks guard Harris, a Milwaukee native, at Wisconsin.  
 
 BAD MOVE : The Bucks could not get the ball inbounds after a timeout with 15.2 seconds left and had to burn their final 20-second timeout to prevent a turnover. That turned out to be huge when they couldn't call a timeout after Horford's basket and inbound the ball in the front court. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH : Milwaukee's  John Henson  had 11 points and six rebounds in 15 minutes. ... Atlanta's  John Jenkins  made 3 of his 4 3-point attempts to finish with nine points in 19 minutes.  
 
 NOTABLE : The game was the first for Redick in a Milwaukee uniform. He finished with 16 points and seven assists in 35 minutes. More notable, he played five more minutes than Jennings. ... The Bucks lead the league at 7.60 blocks per game but had just two. ...The game opened a six-game road trip for the Hawks, who don't get back to Atlanta until March 5. ... This was the first meeting of the season between the teams. They'll meet three more times over the final 28 games. ... Sanders finished with 12 points and 19 rebounds -- one rebound short of his career high established Dec. 21 at Boston. ...  Zaza Pachulia  had a busy night, setting a franchise record with seven offensive rebounds in a quarter (the second) and also picking up a technical foul and a flagrant foul.  
 
 UP NEXT : For the Hawks, Monday @ Detroit, Wednesday @ Utah, Friday @ Phoenix. For the Bucks, Tuesday @ Dallas, Wednesday @ Houston, Saturday vs. Toronto.
