 THE FACTS:  Pressured by  Shawn Marion, Carmelo Anthony  missed the potential go-ahead jumper with 4.8 seconds left Wednesday and the New York Knicks' fourth-quarter rally came up short in a 114-111 loss to the Dallas Mavericks at the American Airlines Center. 
 
 O.J. Mayo  scored 27 points and  Vince Carter  had a season-high 25 off the bench for the Mavericks (7-6).  Darren Collison  added 19 points and seven assists. Dallas scored 65 points in the second half against the NBA's stingiest defense and had a 12-point lead with less than six minutes to play. 
 The Knicks (8-2) didn't concede their second loss of the season without a fight, using a 21-10 run to cut the deficit to 112-111. They ran an isolation play with Anthony, who had to force a contested, double-clutch 15-footer with Marion's hand in his face.  Dahntay Jones  secured the rebound, got fouled by Anthony and drained both free throws to finish it. 
 Anthony scored a team-high 23 points and New York got double-doubles from  Tyson Chandler  (21 points, 13 rebounds) and  Raymond Felton  (18 points, 11 assists). In his first game back in Dallas,  Jason Kidd  was 5-for-8 from 3-point range and filled up the box score with 17 points, six rebounds, five assists and five steals. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Tonight my shot felt good and my body felt better. I'm a little banged up, but at the same time I felt a little better and just let my shot fly." -- Carter. 
 
 THE STAT:  Entering the game, the Knicks boasted the NBA's best fourth-quarter defense, allowing just 18.7 points on 35.4 percent shooting from the field. The Mavericks scored 30 in the fourth and shot 45 percent (9-for-20), including 4-for-6 from long distance. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Both teams were on fire from downtown. New York finished 15-for-31 and Dallas was 13-for-29. The Mavericks, who trailed by 10 in the first half, seized the momentum in the game by knocking down six of their treys during a 29-10 run from the 5:27 mark of the third quarter through the 9:16 mark of the fourth. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Vince is Vince. I mean, he's been doing it a long time in this league." -- Knicks head coach  Mike Woodson. 
 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "He did a great job, especially on that last possession. We weren't sure what they were going to do, but we had a switching lineup in because the pick and roll had killed us all night and then they went iso. I always like Shawn's odds in those situations where he can play a guy one on one. He's the best we have. He did a great job." -- Mavericks head coach  Rick Carlisle  on Marion's defense on Anthony. 
 
 HOT:  Carter scored 11 straight Dallas points to start the second quarter, including three 3-pointers¸ but that was just an appetizer for his 14-point fourth quarter.  
 
 NOT:  Anthony committed seven of the Knicks' 14 turnovers and was in foul trouble throughout the second half, ultimately fouling out with 3.3 seconds left. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Apparently Carlisle got through to the Mavericks at intermission following a careless first half in which they committed 11 turnovers, leading to 17 points for the Knicks. Dallas turned it over just three times (for three points) in the second half. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  One fan won't have to brave the Black Friday shopping crowds after swishing a halfcourt shot during a third-quarter promotion to win a 60-inch television. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  After sitting out Monday's loss against Golden State (coach's decision), Mavericks forward  Jae Crowder  came back strong. He matched his season high with 12 points, all in the second half, and was 3-for-5 from behind the arc. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Forward  Troy Murphy  made his first start for the Mavericks, but left in the second half due to a upper respiratory illness and did not return. It was his first start since Nov. 9, 2010 with the Nets. He replaced  Elton Brand , who came off the bench for the first time since Jan. 20, 2010 with the 76ers. ... This was Carter's 999th career game. ... The previous high for points allowed by the Knicks came in a 105-95 loss at Memphis on Nov. 16. ... Mayo extended his streak to 11 straight games with 18-plus points. ... After blocking a combined 25 shots in their two previous games, the Mavericks had only one rejection by  Chris Kaman  against the Knicks. ... New York only used eight players. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Saturday vs. Los Angeles Lakers, Tuesday @ Philadelphia, Wednesday @ Chicago. For the Knicks, Friday @ Houston, Sunday vs. Detroit, Monday @ Brooklyn.
