 THE FACTS:   Deron Williams  scored 22 points,  Andray Blatche  contributed 20 points off the bench and  Reggie Evans  swept a career-high 23 rebounds as the Brooklyn Nets crushed the Philadelphia 76ers, 109-89, Tuesday night at the Wells Fargo Center.  Joe Johnson  scored 15 points,  Brook Lopez  had 13 and  Gerald Wallace  had 11 for the Nets, who improved to 6-1 under interim coach  P.J. Carlesimo . Brooklyn improved to 20-15 with the victory. 
 
 Jrue Holiday  paced the Sixers with 19 points,  Spencer Hawes  had 14 points off the bench and Nick Young chipped in with 11. It was the fourth straight loss for Philadelphia, which dropped to 15-21. 
 QUOTABLE: "I don't need to score. I just do what I do to get wins." 
 --  Reggie Evans , on his career night off the glass. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Nets outrebounded Philadelphia, 50-32. At one point in the second half, Evans was actually outrebounding the entire Sixers team. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Nets built a slim 48-47 lead at halftime before opening the third quarter on an 18-2 run for a commanding 66-49 advantage. That was more than enough of a cushion to cruise the rest of the game. 
 
 HOT:  Williams was 7-for-11 while Lopez was 6-for-10. Holiday knocked down seven of his 11 shots for the Sixers. 
 
 NOT:  Jason Richardson missed six of his nine shots, including all four from beyond the arc for the Sixers. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It just looked like we were fresher." 
 -- Nets interim coach  P.J. Carlesimo . 
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Johnson had 15 points, five assists, four rebounds, one steal and one blocked shot. It was a very effective all-around performance. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The crowd was relatively quiet for much of the game. One of the largest cheers in the first half came when a trio of Philadelphia Flyers were announced --  Matt Read ,  Scott Hartnell  and  Claude Giroux .  Mark Wahlberg  was also in attendance. But when the lead swelled beyond 20, any cheers that were prevalent quickly turned to boos. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "As a team, we've got to stay confident. We've got to try to get right back at it." 
 -- Sixers guard  Evan Turner. 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Nets did a terrific job of exploiting the Sixers' weakness in the middle. Even when shots weren't falling, Evans was there to pick up virtually every loose ball. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Holiday started hot but the Sixers inexplicably went away from him. They probably could have run a lot more offense through their potential All-Star. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Nets guard  Tyshawn Taylor  was scoreless in a brief 4:04 stint while forward  Mirza Teletovic  had eight points in 14 minutes. In addition, forward  Tornike Shengelia  added two points. For the Sixers, forward  Arnett Moultrie  was scoreless with one rebound in 6:06 while guard  Maalik Wayns  had seven points in 8:34. Wayns was re-signed earlier Tuesday to a 10-day contract after being waived two days ago. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Nets guard-forward  Jerry Stackhouse  missed the game because of personal reasons. ... Sixers reserve center  Kwame Brown  was out because of a death in the family. ... The Sixers have scored below 90 in six of the past seven games. ... The Nets improved to 10-2 when eclipsing the 100-point mark. ... Philadelphia fell to 2-11 when giving up 100 or more points. ... Brooklyn is averaging 102.9 points per game in the seven games under Carlesimo. This victory snapped the Nets' 24-game streak of scoring below 100 against the Sixers. ... Evans' previous career-high of 22 rebounds came for Toronto against the Sixers on Nov. 24, 2010. ... The Nets led by as many as 26 points. 
 
 NEXT:  For the Nets, Friday vs. Phoenix, Sunday vs. Indiana, Jan. 15 vs. Toronto. For the Sixers, Wednesday @ Toronto, Saturday vs. Houston, Jan. 15 vs. New Orleans.
