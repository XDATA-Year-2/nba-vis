  Notebook: Bulls 110, Bucks 91 Posted Wednesday February 22, 2012 11:08PM By Kent McDill, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  Playing against a depleted Milwaukee Bucks team, the host Chicago Bulls cruised to a 110-91 victory Wednesday.  Carlos Boozer  led the Bulls with 20 points, and  Derrick Rose  and  Luol Deng  had 16 points apiece. The Bulls shot 54 percent from the field. The Bucks, who had only 10 health players, were led by  Brandon Jennings  with 20 points. THE FACTS II:  With his 13 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists,  Joakim Noah  became the first Bulls center to record a triple-double since  Artis Gilmore  did it Dec. 20, 1977. QUOTABLE:  "We got the W, it's my birthday in a couple of days, there's going to be a team function tonight with all the Bulls players, so it's going to be fun."    -- Bulls center Joakim Noah. THE STAT:  The Bulls, who lead the league in assists per game, had 32 assists on 43 baskets Wednesday. THE STAT II:  The Bulls had 20 turnovers that led to 22 Milwaukee points. The Bucks had only nine turnovers. INJURY UPDATE:  The Bucks had four players out of the game due to injury, including center  Andrew Bogut , who remains out with fractured ankle.  Drew Gooden  (wrist sprain),  Tobias Harris  (shoulder contusion) and  Stephen Jackson  (hamstring) were also out. Bulls guard  C.J. Watson  missed his second game due to a concussion. Bulls guard  Rip Hamilton  remained out with a thigh bruise. HOT:  Boozer, a career 54 percent shooter, is shooting 69.4 percent (50-for-72) in his last six games. He was nine for 12 against the Bucks Wednesday. BAD MOVE:  Bulls coach  Tom Thibodeau  faces constant criticism in Chicago for playing Rose and Deng too many minutes, especially in blowouts. On Wednesday, Thibodeau kept Deng in the game until the 3:59 mark of the fourth quarter, playing him 34 minutes, the most of any player in the game for either team. QUOTABLE II:  "He's like my big brother. I'm fortunate to have him as a teammate."    -- Bulls guard Derrick Rose on Joakim Noah. NOTABLE:  The Bulls have played 67 consecutive regular-season games without losing two games in a row, dating back to Feb. 7, 2011. But that streak is not the team record. From Feb. 27, 1995, through Feb. 4, 1996, the Bulls played 72 regular season games without losing two straight.  Michael Jordan  returned from retirement early in the streak, on March 19, 1995, and the '95-96 Bulls went on to set a record with 72 victories before winning the franchise's fourth NBA title. The streak ended when the '95-96 Bulls lost at Denver and at Phoenix Feb. 4-6, 1996. UP NEXT:  For the Bulls, Tuesday vs. New Orleans, Wednesday at San Antonio, March 2 at Cleveland. For the Bucks, Tuesday vs. Washington, Wednesday at Boston, March 2 at Atlanta.
