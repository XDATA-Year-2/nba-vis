 THE FACT:  The Charlotte Bobcats are now 5-0 when scoring 100 or more and have rallied from deficits of at least 16 points in three of their last four games.  
 
 THE LEAD: Khris Middleton  made a buzzer beater, but his feet were on the 3-point line giving the Charlotte Bobcats (14-15) a 111-110 overtime victory Monday night at Time Warner Cable Arena.  Kemba Walker  scored seven of his 25 points in overtime as Charlotte rallied from an 18-point deficit in the first half.  Al Jefferson  had a season-high 26 points in the win while  Brandon Knight  matched the 26 points to lead the Bucks (6-22).  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It's always tough to come back from a deficit like that. We had to play hard. It's about getting stops and getting buckets. It was mind over matter out there. We got it together and we were able to hit open shots and get a good win out there." --  Jefferson 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Charlotte made a season-high 10 3-point field goals in the win over Milwaukee.  Anthony Tolliver  was a perfect 4-for-4 from behind the arc and the Bobcats made 10-of-17 attempts on the night. The Bucks also had 10 3s, but took 28 attempts to reach that total. The Bobcats are last in the NBA in both made 3s (4.7 per game) and 3-point field goal percentage (.313). Charlotte is now 8-3 on the season when making at least five 3-pointers.  
 
 TURNING POINT : For as miserable as most of that first half was for Charlotte, the Bobcats only trailed by two at the half after a 13-2 run to close the half. Knight's jumper put Milwaukee up 52-39 with 3:44 to play in the half. Jefferson had a short jumper to get the Bobcats' run going. Walker's four-foot jumper capped a 10-2 spurt and then  Josh McRoberts'  3 with 36 seconds left closed out the 13-2 run and made the win all the more probable headed to the locker room.  
 
 HOT :Jefferson had a game and season-high 26 points and grabbed nine rebounds Monday night. Jefferson just missed his fourth straight double-double. Over the last 13 games, Jefferson is averaging 17.8 points, 10.8 rebounds and 1.8 assists during that span.  
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT :Walker was one rebound shy of a triple-double Monday. The Bobcats point guard had 25 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds. It was his sixth straight game with at least 20 points and his 18th consecutive game scoring in double figures which ties the longest streak of his career. He now has 14 games with 20 points or more. Over his last 12 contests, Walker is averaging 22.6 points, 5.4 assists and 4.6 rebounds during that stretch.  
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  Former NBA player and current NASCAR analyst  Brad Daugherty  was in attendance Monday night. Also in the crowd was former North Carolina Tar Heel  P.J. Hairston . 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH: Cody Zeller  had a career-high 12 points on 6-for-12 shooting. For Milwaukee, they had a pair of rookies in the starting lineup.  Giannis Antetokounmpo  finished the night with 12 points and six rebounds while  Miroslav Raduljica  was perfect from the floor with eight points and four rebounds.  
 
 NOTABLE:  Charlotte is now 9-6 in games decided by six points or less and 2-0 in overtime ... The Bobcats have won 9 of the last 10 at home against Milwaukee and swept the season series for the first time in franchise history ... the Bobcats had a season-high 30 assists ... Tolliver had a season-high 12 points ...  Gerald Henderson  had a season high six assists ... The Bucks have the NBA's worst record at 6-22 and injuries have been a huge factor. They've already lost 99 player-games to injury/illness ... the Bucks have not had a winning streak yet this season ... Knight has scored in double figures for the sixth consecutive game and notched his third double-double of the season ...  Caron Butler  has now scored in double figures in both games since returning from injury ...Middleton scored 19 points, reaching double figures for the sixth consecutive game and 16th time this season. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Bucks, Friday @ Brooklyn, Saturday vs. Minnesota, Tuesday @ L.A. (Lakers). For the Bobcats, Friday vs. Oklahoma City, Saturday @ Atlanta, Monday @ Utah.
