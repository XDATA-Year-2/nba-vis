  Notebook: Bulls 105, Knicks 102   By Adam Zagoria, for NBA.com Posted Thursday February 2, 2012 11:13PM THE FACTS: Derrick Rose  and the Chicago Bulls shook off Wednesday's loss in Philadelphia and handed the Knicks their 10th loss in 12 games, 105-102, at Madison Square Garden. The reigning NBA MVP scored 15 of his 32 points in the fourth quarter and added 13 assists and four rebounds for the Bulls (19-6). Amar'e Stoudemire  and  Carmelo Anthony  both missed potential game-tying 3 pointers in the final 11 seconds, with Anthony's coming at the buzzer. Stoudemire finished with a season-high 34 points to go with 11 rebounds and Anthony added 26 points for the Knicks (8-14), who played the first of three games in three nights. The Bulls played without  Rip Hamilton  and  Luol Deng . QUOTABLE:  "I love playing here. The crowd really loves their basketball. They know their basketball. I love the energy. "   --  Rose. THE STAT:  Rose scored 15 of his team's 28 points in the fourth quarter and 22 of their 50 in the second half. TURNING POINT:  Stoudemire had a chance to tied it up at 103 but his 3-pointer clanked off the rim with 11 seconds left.  Taj Gibson  then made 1-of-2 free throws to make it a four-point game, 104-100. After Rose made 1-of-2 free throws to make it 105-102, Anthony missed a long 3-pointer at the buzzer. QUOTABLE II:  "He can make that shot as well as anybody...If he's wide open I said to go ahead and take it. If not, then Melo's open on the other side."   --  Knicks head coach  Mike D'Antoni  on Stoudemire's missed 3-pointer with 11 seconds left. WHO'S HOT: Kyle Korver  was an efficient 4-for-7 and 3-for-5 from beyond the arc in scoring 16 points for the Bulls. WHO'S NOT:  The Knicks bench. They were outscored 16-3 by the Bulls' reserves in the first half, when  CJ Watson  had 10. For the game, the Bulls' bench outscored the Knicks' bench, 25-6. Only  Toney Douglas  (six points) scored off the Knicks' bench. QUOTABLE III:  "Tonight we were just trying to redeem ourselves with this game."   --  Rose. NOTABLE:  Rose and Anthony were both named Eastern Conference starters for the Feb. 26 All-Star Game in Orlando.
