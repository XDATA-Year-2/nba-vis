 THE FACTS:  Playing their fourth road game in five nights, the Golden State Warriors rarely had a chance to catch their breath Saturday as  Shawn Marion  and the Dallas Mavericks pushed the tempo and handed the Warriors their fourth consecutive loss, 116-91. 
 Marion had a season-high 26 points and 11 rebounds for the Mavericks (22-28), who outscored the weary Warriors (30-21) by a decisive 29-8 margin in fastbreak points.  O.J. Mayo  tallied 19 points and nine assists,  Darren Collison  had 18 points and eight assists,  Dirk Nowitzki  scored 15 and  Elton Brand  added 11 points and 11 boards. 
 Golden State shot just 38.2 percent, with  Stephen Curry  scoring 18 points on 8-for-23 shooting and  Klay Thompson  held to 11 on a 4-for-14 night. All-Star  David Lee , who leads the league with 32 double-doubles, finished with 10 points and six rebounds. The Warriors turned it over 16 times, leading to 27 points for Dallas. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We're fine. There's no panic. We lost another game. We didn't play well, we made mistakes, we did not put together 48 minutes of basketball, but there's going to be no panic. We're going to regroup and be preparing for the next one." 
 -- Warriors coach  Mark Jackson 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Warriors have allowed an average of 33.5 points in the first quarter during this losing streak, surrendering at least 30 in all four games.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  Dallas seized control early with a 14-0 first-quarter run, with eight of those points by Collison. Golden State went 4:29 without scoring, missing seven consecutive shots and turning it over twice. Collison scored 13 in the opening frame. 
 
 HOT:  The Mavericks shot 51.2 percent in the first half, including 6-for-11 from behind the arc, and led by as many as 27 points. 
 
 NOT:  Golden State's starting backcourt of Curry and Thompson were a combined 4-for-21 (1-for-6 from 3-point range) in the first half. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  This game wasn't exactly a close shave for the Mavericks, who have vowed to grow out their beards until the team gets back to .500.  
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  The subject of recent trade rumors in Dallas, Marion is playing his best basketball of the year. It was his fourth double-double in his last five games and his fourth 20-point effort of the season. "The Matrix" was 11-for-16 overall and 2-for-3 from deep with two steals, one block and one assist. His previous season high was 23. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It'll take care of itself. Right now, I'm a Dallas Maverick and that's what it's about."

 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The Grambling State University Tiger Marching Band performed at halftime on African-American Heritage Night at the American Airlines Center. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:   Draymond Green  fell just short of his first career double-double, contributing eight points and a team-high nine rebounds off the Warriors' bench. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Dallas center  Chris Kaman  (concussion) missed his sixth straight game. For the Warriors, center  Andrew Bogut  did not play after logging a season-high 28 minutes in Friday's loss at Memphis and guard  Jarrett Jack  (right shoulder contusion) missed his third straight game. ... Golden State scored the fewest points in the first quarter (16) and first half (36) by any Dallas opponent this season. That was also the fewest first-half points scored by the Warriors this year. ... The Warriors swept the first two meetings this season, although Nowitzki didn't play in either contest. ... With two free throws at the 11:06 mark of the fourth quarter, Nowitzki passed  Wilt Chamberlain  (6,057) for 15th place in NBA history. ... Dallas swingman  Vince Carter  went to the locker room to have his left ankle treated in the third quarter, but was back on the floor in the fourth. ... The Mavericks are 13-3 at home when scoring 100-plus points and 11-1 at home when leading at halftime. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Monday vs. Atlanta, Wednesday vs. Sacramento, Feb. 20 vs. Orlando. For the Warriors, Tuesday vs. Houston, Feb. 19 @ Utah, Feb. 20 vs. Phoenix.
