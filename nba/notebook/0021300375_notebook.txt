 THE FACT:  The Knicks needed two overtimes and 55 ½ minutes of playing time from  Carmelo Anthony , but they outlasted the struggling Bucks. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Carmelo Anthony scored 29 points, including eight in the second overtime, to lead the New York Knicks to a 107-101 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks Wednesday night at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. 
 
 Tyson Chandler  posted nine points, nine rebounds and three blocks in 36 ½  minutes for the Knicks (8-17) after missing the previous 20 games with a broken leg.  Beno Udrih  added 21 points. 
 
 Brandon Knight  scored a career-high 36 for the Bucks (5-20), but also had eight turnovers. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It was a grind. Those guys never gave up, never quit. It was one of those dig-down-deep games that we had to go get." 
 -- Carmelo Anthony 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Knicks shot just 37.6 percent, but they shot 41.5 percent on 3-pointers, making 17 of a whopping 41 attempts. Anthony made four, and Udrih and  J.R. Smith  made five each. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  In a game that had 30 lead changes and 18 ties, Anthony's 3-pointer with 50.1 seconds left in the second overtime gave the Knicks an insurmountable 104-98 lead. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "This is a big-time win because these are the ones that you can lose and it can throw you in the tank and spiral for a while. When you gut wins out like this together as a team, they're also good building wins. I expect us to build on this." 
 -- Tyson Chandler 
 
 
 HOT:  Udrih made 8-for-12 overall and 5-for-7 from behind the arc. 
 
 NOT:  Starting forwards Anthony and Smith combined to go 16-for-52, with Smith going 7-for-23 and Anthony 9-for-29. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Knight's career-high 36 points included 6-for-12 shooting on 3-pointers and also were supplemented by nine rebounds.  
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Bucks coach  Larry Drew  had 19-year-old rookie  Giannis Antetokounmpo  make his first career start, and the rookie played just under 42 minutes with 10 points, seven rebounds and two assists. Antetokounmpo also played some strong defense on Anthony. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Knicks held a 94-92 lead in the final minutes of the first overtime when Chandler grabbed an offensive rebound of an Anthony miss and threw it back outside to  Andrea Bargnani . For reasons known only to him, Bargnani chucked up a 3-pointer and missed. The Bucks rebounded, and  John Henson 's tip-in forced a second overtime after a timeout. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Tim Hardaway Jr.  played 22 ½ minutes for the Knicks and scored eight points with three rebounds and three assists.  
 
 NOTABLE:  Bucks guard  O.J. Mayo  missed the game as he attended his grandmother's funeral.  Gary Neal  also missed the game with plantar fasciitis in his left foot. ... Henson had a double-double with 20 points and 14 rebounds. ... The Bucks entered the game with a 592-474 deficit in free-throw attempts but had 35 attempts to just 19 for the Knicks. ... Six players -- four on the Bucks -- played more than 48 minutes. ... Knight's big scoring night was marred by eight turnovers. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Knicks, Saturday vs. Memphis, Monday @ Orlando, Wednesday vs. Oklahoma City. For the Bucks, Friday @ Cleveland, Saturday vs. Philadelphia, Monday @ Charlotte.
