  Notebook: Knicks 85, Sixers 79   By Adam Zagoria, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday January 11, 2012 10:33PM THE FACTS:   Carmelo Anthony  scored a game-high 27 points, hitting two clutch foul shots with 16.1 seconds left, as the Knicks won their fourth straight and snapped Philadelphia's six-game winning streak, 85-79, at Madison Square Garden. Amar'e Stoudemire  added 20 points and 10 rebounds and crowd favorite  Josh Harrellson  tallied 13 points off the bench. Harrellson was 3-for-5 from beyond the arc. The Sixers, who were playing their third game in three nights, had won five of their first nine by 20-plus points and entered with the NBA's third-leading offense (101.6). Yet the Knicks held them to 40 percent shooting. The Knicks (6-4) moved to within a game of the first-place 76ers (7-3) in the Atlantic Division. Philadelphia fell into a tie with Atlanta for the third best record in the Eastern Conference. QUOTABLE:  "Philly is one of the hottest teams in the NBA right now and for us to hold them to 79 points, that's a big deal for us."    -- Carmelo Anthony THE STAT:  After getting a total of three points from their bench in Monday's win over Charlotte, the Knicks got 21 from the reserves in this one. Harrellson tallied seven in the first period, when he went 3-for-5 as New York took a 28-15 lead. QUOTABLE II:  "We want him to shoot the ball. He's wide open...When he have an opportunity like that, shoot the shot with confidence and it will go in."    -- Carmelo Anthony on Josh Harrellson to MSG THE STAT II:  The 85 points is the fewest the Knicks have scored in a win since 11/24/2007, when they beat the Bulls 85-78 at MSG. The last time the Knicks scored fewer than 85 in a win was 11/14/2005 in a 73-62 win at Utah. TURNING POINT:  After the Sixers closed a 10-point halftime deficit to 58-56, Anthony scored six straight and Harrellson added a 3-pointer to extend the Knicks lead to 67-56 after three. Anthony scored 12 points in the third. QUOTABLE III:  "Carmelo is very effective in what he does...He's a competitor and he knows how to play."    -- Mike D'Antoni HOT:  The third-leading scorer in the NBA behind  LeBron James  and  Dwyane Wade , Anthony continues to score in crunch time for the Knicks. Although he is shooting just 44 percent from the field, he has been the Knicks go-to guy during this winning streak. His two foul shots with 16.1 seconds left extended the lead to 85-79. NOT:  Knicks starting shooting  Landry Fields  continues to struggle. He shot 2-for-4 for four points with three rebounds, three steals, two assists and three turnovers in 35-plus minutes. NOTABLE:   Tony Battie  was given a flagrant foul for whacking  Tyson Chandler  in the face and drawing blood during an attempted layup in the third period. Chandler exited the game but later returned with cotton plugging up his nose. He finished with just three points on 0-for-1 shooting but had 13 rebounds. NOTABLE II:  D'Antoni said center  Jared Jeffries  (calf) could return Saturday at Oklahoma City at "the earliest." "I think Jared's biting at the bit to play," he added. "We're trying to be cautious with him." INSIDE THE ARENA:  Former Mets and Yankees star  Darryl Strawberry  was in the house. UP NEXT:  For the Knicks, Thursday @ Memphis, Saturday @ Oklahoma City, Monday vs. Orlando. For the 76ers, Friday vs. Washington, Saturday @ Washington, Monday vs. Milwaukee.
