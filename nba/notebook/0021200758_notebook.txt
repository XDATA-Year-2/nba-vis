 THE FACTS:  Even without  Tim Duncan  and  Manu Ginobili , the Spurs still used a dominant second half to rout the Nets 111-86 at Barclays Center.  Tony Parker  carved up the Nets for 29 points and 11 assists, just one helper fewer than the entire Nets team, and six other Spurs scored between nine and 14 points. The Spurs (an NBA-best 40-12) have now won 12 of 13 while the Nets have lost six of nine. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It's us. It's all us. This ain't the first time we've unraveled in the third quarter."  
 
 -- Nets forward  Gerald Wallace 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Spurs were +24 in points off turnovers.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  After outscoring the Nets 30-5 in the third quarter of their previous meeting, the Spurs started the same period with a 12-4 run, including 10 in a row, to re-take the lead.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "In the second half we played a lot better defense. We tried to slow down  Brook Lopez , and on offense our ball movement was great."  
 
 -- Parker  
 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  New York Red Bulls  Thierry Henry  and  Tim Cahill  attended the game. ... The Nets were booed lustily in the fourth quarter. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:   Nando De Colo  did a serviceable job in 12 minutes of action for the Spurs. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Nets, who play at the league's slowest pace, gave up 110-plus points for only the fourth time all season. ... The Spurs shot 12-19 (63 percent) from behind the 3-point line, a number of them back-breaking conversions in the second half. ... Lopez,  Deron Williams  and  Joe Johnson  combined for 52 of the Nets' 86 points. ... In the debut of the national television New York City doubleheader, both local hosts lost as the Knicks fell to the Clippers in the afternoon. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Spurs, Monday @ Chicago, Feb. 19 @ Sacramento, Feb. 21 @ LA Clippers. For the Nets, Monday @ Indiana, Wednesday vs. Denver, Feb. 19 vs. Milwaukee.
