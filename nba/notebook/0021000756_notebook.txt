  Sixers-Knicks Notebook   By Adam Zagoria, for NBA.com Posted Sunday February 6, 2011 3:29PM THE FACTS:   Amar'e Stoudemire  tied his season-high with 41 points and  Landry   Fields  had a career-high 25 points and 10 rebounds as the Knicks stopped a two-game losing streak with a 117-103 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers at Madison Square Garden. QUOTABLE:  "Most people will be talking about Amar'e's 41, but Landry had 25 and 10...He either stopped the bleeding or put us ahead."   - Knicks coach  Mike D'Antoni THE STAT:  The Knicks (26-24) shot 60 percent from the field, including 41 percent (11 of 27) from deep. Fields went 5 of 7 from beyond the arc. TURNING POINT:  After the Sixers cut a 15-point second-half deficit to 83-80 late in the third, the Knicks rattled off three straight 3-pointers - from  Shawne Williams ,  Raymond Felton  (13 points, 13 assists) and  Toney Douglas  - to go ahead 92-80 early in the fourth. The Knicks then outscored the Sixers, 31-23, in the final period. QUOTABLE II:  "I just knew that I was open, so shoot the ball. Part of the D'Antoni system."   -  Fields  on his 3-pointers HOT:  Peekskill, N.Y. native  Elton Brand  had 28 points on 10 of 14 shooting and scored 61 points in the home-and-home with the Knicks. He put up 33 in Friday night's 100-98 win in Philly. NOT:  After putting up 23 points and 14 rebounds Jan. 30 in a win over the Detroit Pistons,  Timofey Mozgov  has tallied 4, 9 and now 3 points in his last three games. NOTABLE:  Stoudemire notched his 17th career 40-point game. His career-high is 50. He also received his 14th technical foul of the season with 9:56 left in the third period. If he gets two more, he will face an automatic one-game suspension. Every two technicals after that merits an additional one-game suspension. QUOTABLE III:  "It's an emotional game. I'd rather have players play with emotion. And if that means he's going to get suspended, then so be it. But I'm definitely not going to be critical of him."   -  D'Antoni  on Stoudemire INSIDE THE ARENA:   John McEnroe  sat courtside. He will play  Ivan Lendl  and  Pete Sampras  will meet  Andre Agassi  in the BNP Paribas Showdown Feb. 28 at MSG. UP NEXT:  For the Knicks, Wednesday vs. Clippers, Friday vs. Lakers, Saturday @ Nets. For the 76ers, Tuesday @ Atlanta, Wednesday vs. Orlando, Friday vs. San Antonio.
