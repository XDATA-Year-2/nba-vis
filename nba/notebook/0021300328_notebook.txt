 THE FACT: LaMarcus Aldridge  missed his first five shots and was 1-for-8 from the field to start the game. He made 11 of his last 14 attempts to finish 12-for-22 shooting. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Aldridge scored 31 points and grabbed a career-high 25 rebounds to lift Portland to a 111-104 victory over Houston Thursday night at the Moda Center. 
 
 Robin Lopez  added 16 points and 10 rebounds and  Niclas Batum  contributed 15 points, six rebounds and six  assists for the Blazers (19-4), who improved to 10-2 at home. 
    Center  Dwight Howard  had 32 points, 17 rebounds and three blocks and guard  James Harden  collected 25 points, seven assists and six rebounds for the Rockets (15-8). 
 
 QUOTABLE:   "That's the best game I've seen L.A. play -- ever. He has improved every year, and right now he is the best power forward in the league, no doubt. And I don't think he's even reached his full potential yet."  
 -- Niclas Batum on Aldridge 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Aldridge became the first player with at least 30 points and 25 rebounds in a game in franchise history. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  After the Rockets had drawn to within 97-95 on Harden's three-point play with 4:45 remaining,  Wesley Matthews  hit a step-back jumper and then finished an 11-1 run with a three-point play for a 108-96 edge. 
 
 HOT:  Howard had a big offensive game, sinking 14-for-22 from the field on an array of post moves and dunks. 
 
 NOT:  Portland point guard  Damian Lillard  was 1-for-10 from the field and finished with only eight points and six assists. It was his second-lowest scoring output of the season. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:   "Portland is really good. [The Blazers] are really good in this gym. They're playing with a lot of confidence. We got to the fourth quarter and had a chance to win, but you know, we move on." 
 -- Houston interim coach  Kelvin Sampson 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Fouled at the free-throw line early in the fourth quarter, Aldridge double-clutched, launched -- and swished. Then he made the foul shot for a three-point play. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  After a dunk on  Joel Freeland  in the second quarter,  Terrence Jones  posed. Moments later, he picked up his third personal foul and departed the game. Karma. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:   "I started slow. Couldn't make a shot for awhile. But then I found a rhythm the third quarter, and it stayed with me the rest of the way." 
 -- LaMarcus Aldridge 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Twenty minutes into the game, Portland was shooting 12-for-40 (.300) but was still within 38-34. The Blazers shot .326 in the first half but shot .558 in the second half to finish at .438. ... Aldridge becomes the first NBA player to record 30 points, 25 rebounds and two blocks since Sacramento's  Chris Webber  in 2001. ... Aldridge's previous career rebounding high was 23. The franchise record is 27 by  Sidney Wicks  in 1975. ... It was Lopez's 10th double-double of the season -- a career-high. ... Houston's  Jeremy Lin  (knee) returned to action after missing the previous six games. He had five points and two assists in 15 minutes off the bench ... the Rockets'  Omer Asik  (thigh) missed his fourth straight game. ... Sampson ran the Rockets in the absence of  Kevin McHale , whose mother died Tuesday night. Her memorial service is Friday. McHale will also miss the Rockets' Friday night game at Golden State, but could return for Sunday's visit to Sacramento.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Rockets, Friday @ Golden State, Sunday @ Sacramento, Wednesday vs. Chicago. For the Trail Blazers, Saturday @ Philadelphia, Sunday @ Detroit, Tuesday @ Cleveland.
