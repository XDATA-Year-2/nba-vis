 THE FACTS :  The Indiana Pacers didn't win the Central Division, but took a giant step in that direction by surviving a 97-92 victory over the Chicago Bulls Sunday night at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. The victory gave the Pacers (38-22) a four-game lead over Chicago (34-26) while also securing the season-series tiebreaker, so Indiana has a strangehold on what would be its first division title since 2003-04. The severely shorthanded Bulls put up a fight and had a chance to tie in the closing seconds, but a turnover with less than a second remaining snuffed their final flicker of hope.  David West  carried Indiana with 31 points, 10 in the fourth quarter.  George Hill  had 11 of his 21 in the final period, but went 1-for-4 on free throws in the final seconds to leave the door open.  Marco Belinelli  and  Jimmy Butler  scored 20 apiece to lead the Bulls, who lost for the eighth time in 13 games. 
 
 QUOTABLE :  "He leads our team in will. He has great will to do whatever is needed to get the 'W.'"  
 -- Indiana coach  Frank Vogel  on West 
 
 THE STAT : Vogel reached 100 career wins is one win shy of 100 for his career. At age 39, Vogel has a 100-64 record, a winning percentage (.610) that ranks second in franchise history to  Larry Bird 's .687 and ahead of such luminaries as  Larry Brown  (.579),  Rick Carlisle  (.552) and  Bobby Leonard  (.537). 
 
 TURNING POINT :  Indiana led most of the way, but Belinelli and Butler heated up in the second half to bring the Bulls back, combining for 29 of their points. Indiana led 92-89 with 1:16 remaining when the Bulls committed a costly 24-second violation. Hill made one of his two free throws, and then Butler hit a tough 3-pointer over  Roy Hibbert  to make it a one-possession game, 95-92, with 19.9 seconds left. Hill missed a pair from the line with 13.6 seconds to go, but Belinelli missed an off-balance 3-pointer. Indiana failed to control the rebound, so the Bulls got one more chance. But West twice deflected the ball after it was passed inbounds, secured possession and was fouled, making both to lock it down. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "It's a huge win. It's someone who was the best in our division. They say to be the best you have to beat the best."  
 -- George Hill 
 
 HOT : West shot 11-for-18 and added seven rebounds to his 31-point night. ... Hill made all six of his shots and added six rebounds, five assists and a pair of blocked shots. ... Belinelli went 4-for-5 from the 3-point line, while Butler was 3-for-5. 
 
 NOT: Paul George  had just three points after the first period and wound up shooting 4-for-14. He did wind up with a 10-point, 10-rebound double-double. ... Indiana's second unit was outscored 31-8 and combined to produce 2-for-9 shooting and two rebounds. ...  Carlos Boozer  played just 16:50, scoring six points on 3-for-9 shooting for the Bulls.  
 
 QUOTABLE III : "I feel like it's always tough to play against Indiana. I'm really proud of the way we competed. We fought really hard and gave ourselves a chance."  
 --  Joakim Noah 
 
 
 NOTABLE : Indiana has won seven of eight, with the only loss coming against the Clippers when Hibbert was serving a one-game NBA suspension. ... Chicago opened a stretch with five of six games on the road not only without  Derrick Rose  (left knee) and  Taj Gibson  (left knee), but also  Richard Hamilton  (back spasms) and  Kirk Hinrich  (sore right foot). Gibson missed his fourth straight game and Hamilton -- who did not make the trip -- his third. Hinrich isn't sure when he sustained the injury. ... Rose watched the game with his teammates from the Bulls' bench for the first time. ... Indiana played the second half without  Danny Granger  for the second game in a row due to recurring pain in his left knee. Granger, who missed the first 55 games with patellar tendinosis in the same knee, was scoreless in eight minutes. ... Noah had 14 points, 10 rebounds and five assists for the Bulls, bringing his three-game totals to 58 points (19.3), 41 rebounds (13.7) and 11 assists (3.7). ... With three wins, the Pacers have won the season series from the Bulls for the first time since 2003-04, which happens to be the last time Indiana won the division.
