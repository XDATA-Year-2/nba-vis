 THE FACT:  Kevin Love  torched the San Antonio Spurs for 42 points behind 8-for-9 shooting from 3-point range, but the Spurs held on to beat Minnesota 117-110. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Kevin Love gave the Spurs fits at the AT&T Center, hitting eight of his nine 3-pointers and grabbing 14 rebounds. Down the stretch, though, the Spurs had no trouble getting to the basket, hitting five layups in the last five minutes of the game en route to a 117-110 win. San Antonio outscored Minnesota 62-36 in the paint on Friday night. 
 
 Tony Parker  led the Spurs in scoring against Minnesota, hitting 13-for-24 from the field for a season-high 29 points and handing out six assists.  Kawhi Leonard  also registered a season-high 19 points on 11 shots, while grabbing six rebounds and dishing out five assists. 
 Love led the Timberwolves with 42 points and 14 rebounds, while  Nikola Pekovic  had 18 points and 11 rebounds and  Ricky Rubio  had 15 points, eight assists and four rebounds. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It doesn't matter if you throw an  Andre Miller  out there on [Tony Parker] or a  Russell Westbrook , he's going to get to the cup and he's going to finish, he's just so good at that. I mentioned Hall-of-Famers, he's one of them." 
 -- Kevin Love 
 
 
 THE STAT:  San Antonio's core four of Parker, Leonard,  Tim Duncan  and  Manu Ginobili  combined for 28 of the Spurs' 32 assists. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Entering the fourth quarter with a nine-point deficit, Ginobili played the entire fourth quarter and over eight minutes with Parker. The pair combined for 28 points and six assists in the period helping the Spurs to a seven-point win. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We gave them too much penetration, backdoors and points in the pain. It just killed us."  
 -- Timberwolves coach  Rick Adelman 
 
 
 HOT:  Love, obviously. Love drained eight of his nine 3-point attempts, going 5-for-6 in the third quarter alone. 
 
 COLD:  Minnesota's interior defense. San Antonio shot 31-for-41 (75.6 percent) in the paint for 62 points. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Love scored 42 points on 15-for-27 from the field with 14 rebounds, eight 3-pointers, two assists and a steal. Pekovic had 18 points and 11 rebounds for Minnesota. Rubio scored 15 points on 5-for-13 shooting with eight assists and four steals, while  Kevin Martin  scored 14 points on 4-for-12 shooting with four assists, two steals, two rebounds and two 3-pointers. 
 For the Spurs, Parker had 29 points on 13-for-24 shooting with two 3-pointers, six assists and three rebounds. Ginobili scored 20 points off the bench with two 3-pointers, nine assists and four rebounds. Leonard had 19 points, three 3-pointers, six rebounds, five assists, two steals and a block. Duncan grabbed 14 rebounds for the Spurs with 12 points, eight rebounds, two steals and three blocked shots. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Love, Parker and Leonard all reached season highs in points on Friday night. The win brings the Spurs just a half game behind the Portland Trail Blazers for best record in the Western Conference.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Timberwolves, Sunday @ Memphis, Monday @ Boston, Wednesday vs. Portland. For the Spurs, Saturday @ Utah, Monday @ L.A. Clippers, Wednesday vs. Phoenix.
