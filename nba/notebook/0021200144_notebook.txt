 THE FACTS:  Center  Greg Monroe  had 20 points and 13 rebounds as the Detroit Pistons won their second game this season, a 103-83 romp over the weary Boston Celtics at The Palace of Auburn Hills Sunday night.  Jason Maxiell  added 15 points for the Pistons, who had six double-digit scorers. Rookie forward  Jared Sullinger  had 16 points for the Celtics, who had won four of their last five but were playing their fourth game in five nights. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We had really good defensive energy and that's what it's going to take for us. It's not about getting the ball or getting your touches, it's about getting stops. The two games we've won, we've seen a defensive commitment." 
 
 -- Detroit coach  Lawrence Frank 
 
 
 THE STAT:  31.6. Detroit's defense had allowed 66 second-half points to Orlando while squandering a double-digit lead Friday, the third time the Pistons had blown a double-figure lead at home. There was no repeat Sunday as the Pistons held the Celtics to 12 baskets on 31.6 percent shooting in the second and third quarters. Boston, which trailed by as much as 18 in the third, finished with 40 second-half points and committed 18 turnovers during the game. The Celtics had just 12 assists on 32 baskets as their half court sets were completely stifled by the Pistons' energy.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  Detroit built some momentum entering the second half by going on a late six-point run in the first half. Maxiell finished that run off with a block and a 17-foot jumper, giving his team a 48-40 lead. He also scored eight of the Pistons' 23 third-quarter points when they pulled away. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It opened our eyes. Those are games we should have won. We could have controlled that. I wouldn't say it was a good thing (character-wise) but I definitely think it was an eye-opener." 
 
 -- Monroe on Detroit's previous fourth-quarter collapses 
 
 
 HOT:  Monroe lifted his season averages to 16.8 points and 9.8 rebounds with his double-double. He got going early with eight first-quarter points and finished strong as well with eight fourth-quarter points. 
 
 NOT : Celtics guard  Jason Terry  was a non-factor, contributing just five points on 1-for-6 shooting. He had 20 points, his season high, against Toronto on Saturday but was neutralized by rookie Singler and Stuckey. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Frank left Singler in the lineup for the third consecutive game and the 2011 second-round pick was solid all-around. He shot 6-for-9 from the field and also had two assists. He's averaging 14.7 points in the last three games. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Celtics coach  Doc Rivers  left Rondo in the game during garbage time so that Rondo could increase his streak of 10-assist games to 34. There was no other reason to keep his starting point guard in the game and it tainted the streak. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Boston reserve center and former Piston  Darko Milicic  missed the game for personal reasons. ...  Paul Pierce  had 13 points and tweaked his ankle in the late going. ... The Pistons avoided their third 1-10 start in franchise history. They had one win after 11 games in two previous seasons, 1962-63 and 1980-81. They were also 2-9 during the lockout-shortened season a year ago and finished 25-41. ... Rondo's assists streak is third all-time behind  Magic Johnson 's 46 (spanning the 1982-83 and 1983-84 seasons) and  John Stockton 's 37 (spanning the 1988-89 and 1989-90 seasons).  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Celtics, Wednesday vs. San Antonio, Friday vs. Oklahoma City, Sunday @ Orlando. For the Pistons, Wednesday @ Orlando, Friday vs. Toronto, Sunday @ New York.
