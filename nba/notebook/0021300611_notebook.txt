 THE FACT:  The Grizzlies are now 0-10 against Southwest Division opponents, including 0-3 against the Pelicans, as they remain the only NBA team winless within its division. 
 
 THE LEAD:  With the NBA All-Star voting ending at midnight,  Anthony Davis  made one final case why he should represent the hometown New Orleans Pelicans, scoring a game-high 27 points with 10 rebounds, four blocked shots and four steals in a 95-92 win over the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday at FedExForum. 
 The win snapped the Pelicans' eight-game losing streak, while also ending the Grizzlies' five-game winning streak.  Tyreke Evans  added 15 points off the bench for New Orleans (16-24). Memphis (20-20) was led by  Zach Randolph 's 23 points and game-high 20 rebounds, 10 coming on the offensive end.  Courtney Lee  had 19 points. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "You can't get wins like this if you don't have big-time character and tough guys in your locker room. The way we battled tonight says a lot about our assistant coaches and those guys. They just rally around each other. Even when things were starting to look like the same 'ole, same 'ole, we had a few guys, A.D. and Tyreke in general, [and  Brian Roberts ], who stepped up and said, 'Not tonight.' "  
 -- Pelicans coach  Monty Williams 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The win clinched season series for New Orleans against the Grizzlies. The Grizzlies have won the season series against New Orleans only twice in franchise history, in 2004-05 and 2011-12. The Pelicans have also beaten the Grizzlies four straight times. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Grizzlies tied the game at 76 early in the fourth quarter, but unlike their previous eight straight losses, the Pelicans held tough, making a 9-0 run to go up 85-76 with 6:30 to go. The Grizzlies pulled to within two points three times, but could never regain the lead. 
 
 HOT:  The third quarter featured forwards Davis and Randolph going back and forth at each other. After scoring just six points in the first half, Davis had 15 in the third quarter on 4-for-6 shooting from the floor, and 7-for-8 from the free-throw line. Randolph also was held to six first-half points, but he erupted for 17 in the third on 7-for-9 shooting from the floor and 3-for-4 from the free-throw line. 
 
 NOT:  The Grizzlies' leading scorer,  Mike Conley , struggled most of the night with his shot. Conley missed 11 of his 15 shot attempts to finish with 13 points, five below his average. Conley was just 1-for-5 from 3-point range. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We came into tonight and we walked around and we walked around. We are not going to play better until we play harder. We have to play harder, we have to run harder, we have to screen harder and we have to defend harder from the first minute of the game. We cannot try and wait until there are five or six minutes left in the game and try to go like crazy."  
 -- Grizzlies coach  Dave Joerger 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Grizzlies had their six-game home winning streak snapped and are now just 11-13 at FedExForum this season. The Pelicans improved to 7-14 on the road, with two of those wins coming in Memphis. ... New Orleans led for most of the game, getting contributions from several players throughout. Point guard  Brian Roberts  got the Pelicans off to a strong start with a couple of first-quarter 3-pointers. He scored 11 of his 13 points in the first half. Davis took over in the second half, along with Evans, who scored 11 of his 15 in the fourth quarter. The Grizzlies found it difficult stopping Evans from getting to the rim, and when they did he kicked it out to an open shooter, collecting seven assists. Center  Alexis Ajinca  had 10 points off the bench. ... Randolph had his first 20-20 game since Dec. 4, 2012, when he had 38 points and 22 boards against Phoenix. He now needs just one more double-double to tie  Pau Gasol 's franchise record of 189. ... With his 19 points, Lee is averaging 16.8 ppg as a starter in place of  Tony Allen  (sprained left wrist). ... The Grizzlies had 18 turnovers, 13 in the first half, their highest total since Dec. 30 against Chicago. ... The Pelicans' bench outscored the Grizzlies' bench, 38-18. In the previous 18 games, the Grizzlies' reserves averaged 37.9 points.
