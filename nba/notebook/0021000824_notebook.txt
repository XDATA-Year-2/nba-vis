
 Wizards-Magic notebook   By Dick Scanlon, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday February 16, 2011 11:06PM THE FACTS:   Dwight Howard  scored 32 points and the Orlando Magic entered the All-Star break with a 101-76 rout of the Washington Wizards. Rookie  John Wall  had 27 points and five assists for the injury-depleted Wizards, who lost for the 26th time in 27 road games. Washington shot only 35 percent and fell behind by 29 points late in the third quarter. QUOTABLE:  "I thought we played really hard the first half, but couldn't make a shot. It was one of those things, the harder we tried, the harder we fell. It was like being in quicksand."   -- Wizards coach  Flip Saunders . THE STAT:  The Magic swept the four-game series against the Wizards, winning by an average of 18.3 points. TURNING POINT:  After Wall beat the Magic down the floor for two layups and a 5-0 Wizards lead just 77 seconds into the game, Magic coach  Stan Van Gundy  called timeout. That was the beginning of the end for the Wizards. "I just wanted to get us into the game correctly defensively," Van Gundy said. HOT:  Howard is 25-for-31 (.806) from the floor in the last two games. QUOTABLE II:  "In the third quarter, I thought Dwight did a dominant job. He just took over the game and got a big lead for his team."   -- John Wall. NOT:  Other than Wall, the Wizards shot 19-for-66 (.288) . . . The Magic have shot better than 33 percent from 3-point range only once in their last six games. QUOTABLE III:  "What people don't realize is for the last three or four years, we've had almost the same record going into the break, so it's not like we're playing bad basketball where we're out of the playoff race." (The Magic were 38-13 at the break in 2009, 36-18 last year and are 35-21 now).   -- Dwight Howard. IN THE ARENA:  Pittsburgh Steelers cornerback  Ike Taylor , who trains at Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex, attended the game. ROOKIE WATCH:  Wall goes into the All-Star break as the NBA's rookie leader in assists (8.9) and steals (1.7) and the No. 2 rookie scorer (15.0). NOTABLE:  The Wizards played without leading scorer  Nick Young  and  Rashard Lewis , who have knee injuries, and lost  Al Thornton  in the second quarter to a dislocated right middle finger . . . Howard has had 15 straight double-doubles. UP NEXT:  For the Wizards, Wednesday (Feb. 22) vs. Indiana, Thursday (Feb. 23) @ Philadelphia, Saturday (Feb. 25) @ Miami. For the Magic, Wednesday (Feb. 23) vs. Sacramento, Friday (Feb. 25) vs. Oklahoma City, Sunday (Feb. 25) vs. Cleveland.
