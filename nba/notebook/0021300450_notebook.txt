 THE FACT:  The Thunder's 25-5 record is the team's best start since moving to Oklahoma City from Seattle. 
 
 THE LEAD: Kevin Durant  led the way with 33 points and second year man  Jeremy Lamb  scored a career-high 22 points in leading the Oklahoma City Thunder to a 117-86 rout of the Houston Rockets Sunday. 
 The Thunder (25-5) picked up their second straight win without All-Star point guard  Russell Westbrook  in the lineup. Westbrook had a third surgical procedure on his right knee on Friday. His pal Durant scored his 33 on 11-for-17 shooting. He also grabbed a game-high 13 rebounds. Lamb's 22 points came on 8-for-10 shooting. Reggie Jackson, filling in for Westbrook, ended his night with 16 points on 7-for-12 shooting and eight assists. 
 The Rockets (21-12) had just one starter in double figures and shot just 36.5 percent for the game, their second worst shooting night of the season.  Aaron Brooks  came off the bench to lead Houston with 17 points, while  Chandler Parsons  and  Omri Casspi  had 15 points. Houston's two leading scorers  James Harden  (24.0) and  Dwight Howard  (18.2) combined for just 17 points.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We were really locked in on defense. Going in we didn't want to give up many transition points and we wanted to hold our own in the paint. We have to be a stingy defensive team. We did a good job of making them miss a lot of shots." 
 --Thunder coach  Scott Brooks 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Thunder offense had struggled in four previous games without Westbrook, averaging just 91.5 points. OKC's offense hummed tonight though shooting 57.3 percent with 28 assists. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Oklahoma City shut Houston out for the first 6:33 of the game. That put the Rockets in a double digit hole they couldn't come close to digging out of, especially with tired legs playing their fourth game in five nights. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We can't blame it on fatigue. We have to find a way to fight through situations like this. We have to find ways to win." 
 -- Houston's Dwight Howard 
 
 
 HOT:  OKC shot 56.4 percent (22-for-39) in the first half; Durant was 6-for-11 (18 points) in the first 24 minutes to lead all scorers, and he was 5-for-5 (15 points) in the third quarter. 
 
 NOT:  The Rockets missed their first 12 shots and two free throws and trailed 13-0 with 5:30 left in the first quarter. Houston finished the quarter at 20.8 percent (5-for-24). 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  It was the 129th consecutive sellout inside Chesapeake Energy Arena. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Without All-Star point guard Westbrook in the lineup Brooks said before the game the Thunder would have to rely on defense every time out. OKC limited Houston to just 7.1-percent shooting (1-for-14) at the beginning of the game and 32.7 percent (17-for-52) in the first half. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Several times, Rockets coach  Kevin McHale  came to center court urging his team to make the extra pass on offense. Most times they didn't. Houston had just eight assists through three quarters and none in the fourth. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Thunder backup center  Steven Adams  played just over six minutes and scored six points on 3-for-4 shooting. Rockets guard  Isaiah Canaan  played seven minutes in the fourth quarter scoring four points on 1-for-3 shooting. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The 14 points the Rockets scored in the first quarter were the fewest in a first quarter this season and the second fewest they've scored in any quarter. The 86 points Houston scored tonight is the second lowest output this season (81 @ Indiana). 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Rockets, Tuesday vs. Sacramento, Friday vs. New York, Wednesday vs. L.A. Lakers.  For the Thunder, Tuesday vs. Portland, Thursday vs. Brooklyn, Saturday @ Minnesota.
