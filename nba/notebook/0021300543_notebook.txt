 THE FACT:  When these two teams last met at Air Canada Centre (November 26), Brooklyn ended their five-game losing streak winning 102-100. With the win tonight, the Raptors snapped a Nets five-game winning streak. 
 
 THE LEAD:  The Toronto Raptors (18-17) snapped the Brooklyn Nets' (15-22) five game-winning streak with a 96-80 victory at Air Canada Centre on Saturday. The Raptors have now won five of their last six home games bringing their record up to 8-8 at home. More importantly, they have won nine of their last 10 games against sub .500 teams. 
 
 DeMar DeRozan  had a game high 26 points and seven rebounds for the Raptors.  Patrick Patterson  added a double-double of 14 points and 12 rebounds off the bench. The Nets were led by  Paul Pierce 's 15 points, while former Raptor  Alan Anderson  chipped in 13. The Nets didn't look like they were playing on the second night of a back-to-back. Fresh off a double overtime win OVER the Miami Heat, they rallied from as many as 13 points to close the first half down 47-42. Toronto kicked it into high gear after a timeout with 5:52 left in the third quarter, though, as DeRozan scored or assisted on every basket during a 16-6 run to give the Raptors a 68-64 lead after three quarters. DeRozan continued where he left off continuing his run at the start of the fourth extending the Raptors on a 5-0 run, which the Raptors ballooned to as much as 18 in the fourth, outscoring them 28-18 in the final frame. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We stayed patient, we knew they were going to make a run, especially in the second half and e understood that. We stayed disciplined, understood we had to get stops, rebound the ball and push it." 
 -- Raptors guard DeMar DeRozan  
 
 
 THE STAT:  Offensive rebounds fell in favor for the Raptors, snagging 15 in comparison to the Nets nine. The rebounds led to second chance points, Patterson pulled down five rebounds on his own. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  With 5:52 left, the Raptors ended the third quarter on a 16-6 run taking a 68-64 lead into the fourth quarter. DeRozan scored or assisted on every point. With a 68-64 lead, the start of the fourth quarter was much of the same on a 10-2 run. 
 
 HOT:  DeRozan lit up in the second half carrying his team on a third quarter run and shot 5-for-9 from the field for 16 points. 
 
 NOT:  Despite the win, the Raptors shot 40 percent from the floor on 32-for-79 shooting. The Nets challenged often blocking nine of the Raptors shots. 
 
 NOTABLE: Tyler Hansbrough  missed the game with a sprained left ankle. ...The Nets rested  Kevin Garnett,  keeping him out of the second game of a back-to-back. ...It was "Drake Night" at Air Canada Centre as the rapper and team's global ambassador announced the Raptors starters, gave away t-shirts and had a DJ set at halftime. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Raptors, Monday vs. the Bucks, Wednesday @ Celtics and Friday vs. Timberwolves.  For the Nets, Thursday @ Hawks, Monday @ Knicks and Tuesday vs. Magic.
