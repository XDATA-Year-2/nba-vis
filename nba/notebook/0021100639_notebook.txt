  Notebook: Mavs 101, Bobcats 96 Posted Thursday March 15, 2012 11:40PM By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com THE FACTS:   Dirk Nowitzki  scored 27 points and the Dallas Mavericks remained perfect against the Charlotte Bobcats with an uncomfortably close 101-96 victory Thursday at the American Airlines Center. Dallas improved to 15-0 all-time against the franchise since it entered the NBA in 2004-05 and remains the only team that Charlotte has never defeated. Sixth man  Jason Terry  had 18 points,  Rodrigue Beaubois  added 14 off the bench and  Vince Carter  scored all 11 of his points in the second half for the defending champs, who have won back-to-back games for the first time in a month.  Corey Maggette  had 21 points and  Tyrus Thomas  tallied 14 points and eight rebounds for Charlotte. Both sides squandered sizable leads, with the Bobcats blowing a 14-point first-half advantage and the Mavericks melting down in the last few minutes after building a 94-77 lead. QUOTABLE:  "Our goal is to make a push here in the last 21 games and get into the playoffs. We just need to go from there and get better so we can make a run in the playoffs."   -- Dirk Nowitzki, whose Mavericks play their next 12 games against teams with winning records. THE STAT:  The Bobcats are 1-35 when trailing or tied entering the fourth quarter. The Mavericks are 16-0 when leading after the third. TURNING POINT:  Dallas outscored Charlotte 54-26 from the 4:13 mark of the second quarter through the 7:27 mark of the fourth quarter. QUOTABLE II:  "We played as well as we can play. It was just the third quarter that gives us problems, but everything else was almost picture perfect. When they put the zone on us, we couldn't make shots. You've got to give them credit. They came through in the end, but I like the way we played."   -- Charlotte head coach  Paul Silas , whose team dropped to 3-21 on the road. HOT:  Midway through the second quarter, the Bobcats used a 20-4 run to build a 48-34 lead.  Kemba Walker  scored all 10 of his first-half points during that stretch, including a pair of 3-pointers. NOT:  Charlotte shot 23.8 percent (5-for-21) from the field in the third quarter as Dallas flipped a six-point halftime deficit into a six-point lead entering the fourth. GOOD MOVE:  Beaubois was a one-man fast break on back-to-back possessions for the Mavericks in the fourth quarter. He made a layup at the 9:05 mark after a steal by Carter. Next he corralled a rebound on a missed jumper by  Derrick Brown  and sprinted back down the court, wrapped the ball behind his back and flushed a one-handed dunk to give Dallas an 83-72 edge with 8:46 to play. BAD MOVE:  The Mavericks committed six of their 12 turnovers in the second quarter and the Bobcats took full advantage, turning those miscues into 14 points. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Nowitzki was 3-for-7 from 3-point distance and added six rebounds and a team-high five assists. It was his 14th game this season with 25-plus points. ROOKIE WATCH:  Walker finished with 12 points, five boards and four assists of the bench.  Bismack Biyombo  grabbed a game-high 11 rebounds and blocked two shots. NOTABLE:  Mavericks center  Brendan Haywood  left in the third quarter with a mild sprain of his right knee and did not return. ... All 11 Bobcats who got in the game scored at least two points in the first half. ... Charlotte held a halftime lead for just the 11th time in 42 games. ... Dallas is 12-1 when scoring 100 or more points. ... The Mavs outscored the Bobcats in the paint by a 42-20 margin. ... This was just the second time that Dallas has won a game in which it trailed by double figures. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Saturday vs. San Antonio, Monday @ Denver, Wednesday vs. L.A. Lakers. For the Bobcats, Saturday vs. Toronto, Monday vs. Philadelphia, Friday vs. Milwaukee.
