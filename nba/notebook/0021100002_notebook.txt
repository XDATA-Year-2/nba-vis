  Heat-Mavericks Notebook   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Sunday December 25, 2011 6:18PM THE FACTS:  Dallas received a championship banner for Christmas. Miami, the team it defeated to win last season's NBA Finals, received a dose of revenge.  LeBron James  scored 37 points and  Dwyane Wade  added 26 as the Heat soured Sunday's season-opening celebration in Dallas and snapped a long regular-season losing streak to the Mavericks with a wire-to-wire 105-94 victory. Dallas, led by  Jason Terry  (23 points) and  Dirk Nowitzki  (21), had won 14 straight regular-season meetings against Miami dating back to 2004. QUOTABLE:  "It's not about last year's storyline. It's not about anything else other than trying to establish our season on the right note. And obviously I think we did that for the most part."    --Miami head coach  Erik Spoelstra THE STAT:  James broke the Heat record for points in a season opener, set by  Tim Hardaway  with 32 in a double-overtime victory against Detroit on Nov. 2, 1999. James was 11-for-19 from the field and 15-for-19 at the line with 10 rebounds, six assists, two steals and two blocks. TURNING POINT:  Pick a run, any run. Dallas came out flat after an emotional pregame ceremony and Miami maintained control with a 21-4 surge in the first period, a 17-1 spurt in the second and a 16-2 run in the third. The latter, capped by James' alley-oop tip pass to Wade for a dunk, gave the Heat its biggest lead at 78-43. HOT:  The Heat shot 57.1 percent from the field through the first three quarters, including 4-for-5 behind the arc. Miami led 97-65 entering the fourth, then emptied its bench and was outscored 29-8 during the final quarter. NOT:  Dallas newcomers  Lamar Odom  and  Vince Carter  made less-than-favorable first impressions. Odom was ejected at the 5:06 mark of the third quarter after picking up his second technical foul arguing a call, exiting the game with four points (1-of-6 shooting), four rebounds and four fouls. Carter started and contributed five points and three assists in 20:41. NOTABLE:  Miami improved to 6-2 all-time on Christmas Day and 12-12 in season openers, while Dallas lost for the first time on Dec. 25 (2-1) and dropped to 18-14 in openers. ... Heat rookie guard  Norris Cole  tallied seven points and four turnovers in his NBA debut. ... Miami outscored Dallas 44-28 in the paint and 31-10 in fastbreak points. ... The Heat outrebounded the Mavs 51-31. ... There were a combined 40 turnovers in the game, 23 by Miami. ... NBA Commissioner  David Stern  participated in the banner-raising ceremony. ... This was the 400th straight regular-season sellout (20,421) at the American Airlines Center. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Monday vs. Denver, Thursday @ Oklahoma City, Friday vs. Toronto. For the Heat, Tuesday vs. Boston, Wednesday @ Charlotte, Friday @ Minnesota.
