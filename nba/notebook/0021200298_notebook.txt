 THE FACTS: Jrue Holiday  continues to play like an All-Star and led the Philadelphia 76ers with 25 points in their 104-97 victory over the Detroit Pistons Monday night at the Wells Fargo Center.  Thaddeus Young  scored 20 points,  Evan Turner  had 18 and  Spencer Hawes  15 for the Sixers, who improved to 12-9.  Jason Richardson  also chipped in with 13 points. 
 
 Greg Monroe  and  Brandon Knight  scored 22 points each for the Pistons, who fell to 7-16.  Rodney Stuckey  added 19 and  Tayshaun Prince  had 16 for Detroit, which shot just 39.5 percent from the field. 
 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I'm just trying to get myself going early. I'm trying to be active at both ends," --  Hawes, on picking up 15 points, eight rebounds and three blocked shots in nearly 32 minutes off the bench. 
 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Sixers outrebounded the Pistons 45-40, giving them an advantage in this category for three straight games. Philadelphia was outrebounded in nine of the previous 12 games before this three-game streak.  
 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Holiday missed two free throws, but the Pistons couldn't capitalize down 98-95. On the Sixers' next possession, thy worked the shot clock and Holiday knocked down a huge jumper for a 100-95 advantage with 39.6 seconds remaining. Philadelphia's ever-improving point guard clearly didn't let the free throws bother him. 
 
 
 HOT:  Young was 9-for-13 and Turner was 8-for-13. Holiday knocked down 11 of his 20 shots and the Sixers shot 53.7 percent as a team. 
 
 
 NOT:  Detroit forward  Jason Maxiell  misfired on his first nine shots and wound up 1-for-10. 
 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "At the end of the day, we have to be cleaner. We gave up 58 points in the second half." --  Pistons coach  Lawrence Frank. 
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Holiday had 25 points, eight assists, five rebounds and two steals while Turner nearly had a triple-double -- 18 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  It was a fairly quiet crowd for much of the game. When former Sixers center  Darryl Dawkins  was shown on the video board, the fans responded with a nice ovation. Dawkins took in the action from a front row seat. As the Sixers pulled away down the stretch, the crowd of 15,225 could be heard loud and clear. 
 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "I think it's huge. For guys like myself, Jrue and Evan, we can miss shots and know we're going to make them. The coaches have a lot of confidence in us and we as players believe in ourselves. I think for those of us who have been here for a while, it's very big to have confidence and belief in your ability." --  Thaddeus Young. 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Sixers ran their offense through Holiday down the stretch. He had complete control and did a great job of scoring when needed and passing when he deemed it appropriate. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Prince always plays well against the Sixers, and he has a distinct size advantage. The Pistons could have gone to him more, especially in the fourth quarter. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Pistons forward  Kyle Singler  had five points, two rebounds and two assists in 29:07 while center  Andre Drummond  recorded two blocked shots in 13:30. Guard  Kim English  didn't play. For the Sixers, forward  Arnett Moultrie  was scoreless in a brief 1:34 stint while guard  Maalik Wayns  had three points and one assist. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Before the game, injured Sixers center Andrew Bynum addressed reporters and said his right knee is better but his left knee still needs improvement. He has another MRI scheduled for Dec. 20. Bynum has bone bruises on both knees plus weakened cartilage in his knees. ... Sixers guard  Nick Young  returned after missing the past four games with a left toe injury. ... The Pistons had 18 assists and 13 turnovers. ... Stuckey was 9-for-9 from the free throw line. ... Holiday scored 12 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter. It was his seventh 20-point game of the season. ... The Sixers improved to 6-0 when Hawes has reached double figures. ... Philadelphia is 11-0 when leading after three quarters. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Pistons, Tuesday vs. Denver, Friday @ Brooklyn, Saturday vs. Indiana. For the Sixers, Wednesday vs. Chicago, Friday @ Indiana, Sunday vs. L.A. Lakers.
