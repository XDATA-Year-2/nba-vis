 THE LEAD: Kyrie Irving  scored two points in the first quarter against the Washington Wizards -- and then 39 over the final quarters plus overtime to match his career-high of 41 points. 
 
 THE FACTS : Irving scored 15 points in the second quarter and nine points in overtime as the Cleveland Cavaliers snapped a three-game losing streak by rallying for a 103-96 win over the Washington Wizards on Saturday night. 
 Cleveland (4-7), which entered 0-6 on the road this season, trailed by 15 points in the second quarter, took a lead in the third and then control in overtime as Irving scored seven consecutive points. 
 
 Bradley Beal  scored 28 points and  Nene  had 24 for the Wizards (2-7), losers of four straight overall and to the Cavaliers. 
 
 Tristan Thompson  had 15 points and 11 rebounds for the Cavaliers. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "We're down 15. We could have easily quit. We're kind of discombobulated.  Andrew [Bynum ] hadn't practice and I threw him out there and started him. Not one unit out there knew anything that we were doing. I didn't know what we were doing. Threw  Earl [Clark ] in at the four. Earl doesn't know what he's doing at the four. We just kind of made it up on the fly."  
 -- Cavs coach  Mike Brown 
 
 
 THE STAT : Irving outscored Washington 9-6 in overtime. The Wizards shot 10-for-29 combined in the fourth quarter and the extra session. 
 
 TURNING POINT : Irving scored 15 of his 17 first half points in the second quarter. Most came after Cleveland trailed 40-25. He made three 3-pointers inside the final 89 seconds before halftime. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : ""It's just about making plays down the stretch. We got to make plays where you got confidence you can do it. It didn't feel that way."  
 -- Washington coach  Randy Wittman 
 
 
 HOT : Clark made three 3-pointers in the fourth quarter and finished with 11 points. 
 
 NOT :  John Wall  missed all four of his attempts from beyond the arc and the Wizards finished 6-for-25. 
 
 GOOD MOVE : Brown used guard  Matthew Dellavedova  for 31 minutes. Despite only scoring two points, the undrafted rookie received ample praise from his coach and Irving for his defensive effort. 
 
 BAD MOVE : Heading to the free-throw line with 24 seconds remaining in regulation and the Wizards trailing 90-89, Nene could only tie the game after missing the first of two free throws. 
 
 NOTABLE :  Anthony Bennet t, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2013 draft, did not play for the second time this season  
 NEXT: For the Cavaliers, Wednesday vs. Wizards, Friday @ Pelicans, Nov. 23 @ Spurs. For the  Wizards, Tuesday vs. Timberwolves, Wednesday @ Cavaliers, Friday @ Raptors.
