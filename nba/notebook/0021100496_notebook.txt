  Notebook: Warriors 104, Suns 102 Posted Thursday February 23, 2012 12:41AM By Mike Tulumello, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  Rain or shine, good season or bad, the Phoenix Suns could almost always count on one plus: They could beat the Golden State Warriors. But not this season. For the second time since Feb. 13, the Warriors pulled out a win over the Suns. On Wednesday night in Phoenix,  Monta Ellis  buried a 15-foot, turn-around jumper with  Grant Hill  draped all over him with one second left, lifting the Warriors to a thrilling 104-102 win. "Coach [ Mark Jackson ] told me to go at five seconds and get a good shot," Ellis said. "It was a tough shot, but I was locked in and focused." Channing Frye  then got a good look on a potential game-winning 3-pointer from the left corner at the buzzer, but his shot banged harmlessly off the rim. Thus the Warriors (13-17): Won the season series over the Suns (2-1) for the first time since 1994-95. Broke a 13-game losing streak in Phoenix. For the Suns (14-20), Frye had 22 points and nine boards for the Suns.  Marcin Gortat  added 21 points and 15 rebounds. Steve Nash , though, had just seven points, nine assists, five rebounds plus five turnovers. For the Warriors, Ellis had a game-high 26 points. The Warriors raced out to a 21-point lead (59-38) late in the first half. The Suns made a frenzied rally, even pulling ahead three times in the closing minutes. The last time came when  Jared Dudley 's follow shot gave the Suns a 100-99 lead with 2:26 left. Then a  David Lee  free throw, a 20-footer by Ellis and a steal of a Hill pass by  Nate Robinson  -- which led to two Robinson free throws -- gave the Warriors a 104-100 lead. A spectacular putback dunk by Frye and a short banker by Hill tied it up at 104 with 11.6 seconds left. That set up Ellis. "Great players make big-time plays," Jackson said. QUOTABLE:  "If I had to design a win, I would have designed it this way. It was much better for our future to grind out a win. It was a great victory, an absolutely great victory."    -- Warriors coach Mark Jackson. THE STAT:  The Warriors hit 9-for-20 on 3-pointers. The Suns were just 4-for-19. TURNING POINT:  Ellis' big shot. QUOTABLE II:  "The game was lost in the first 10 minutes...I am disgusted with the way we played and I'm disgusted with the fact that we got a chance to go into the break on something upbeat and positive. Instead, we walk through the first 10 minutes, and that cost us the game."    -- Suns coach  Alvin Gentry . HOT:  The Warriors  Dorell Wright  hit 7-for-11, including 3-for-5 on 3-pointers. NOT:  Suns rookie  Markieff Morris  shot 1-for-6. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  This was Gortat's fourth straight 20-point plus game, a career first for him. ROOKIE WATCH:  The Warriors  Klay Thompson  had four points and four rebounds in 11 minutes. NOTABLE:  The Warriors went 5-3 heading into the break. UP NEXT:  For the Warriors, Tuesday @ Indianapolis, Wednesday @ Atlanta and Friday, March 2 @ Philadelphia. For the Suns, Thursday, March 1 vs. Minnesota, Friday March 2 vs. L.A. Clippers and Sunday, March 4 vs. Sacramento.
