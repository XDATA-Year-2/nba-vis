 THE FACTS : The Toronto Raptors (23-33) handed the New York Knicks (32-20) their fourth loss in a row, defeating them 100-98 at a sold out Air Canada Centre Friday night. This was the Raptors second consecutive win against the Knicks after beating them last Wednesday 92-88 in New York, starting their losing streak.  Rudy Gay  led all scorers with a season-high 32 points,  DeMar DeRozan  added 18 points and six assists and  Kyle Lowry  scored 15 points with a game-high seven assists.  
 The Raptors rebounded from being down as many as six points in the first half, to go on a 20-8 run in the third quarter, where Rudy Gay scored 17 points in the frame. However, the Knicks went on an 18-7 run of their own, to take their fist lead of the fourth quarter, 88-86 with 6:10 left. However Gay came up big again, scoring nine in the fourth to finish with a season-high 32 points, sinking three free throws down the stretch to close out the game scoring.  Kyle Lowry 's floater over  Tyson Chandler  with 28.9 seconds left was the game-winner, putting the Raptors up 97-95 in a game that had a distinct playoff feel. 
 
 Carmelo Anthony 's 32 points and six rebounds, led the Knicks while  J.R.Smith  and  Amar'e Stoudemire  added 19 and 14 points off the bench respectively. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I just wanted to be aggressive. Up until then, I was letting the game come to me. Then shots started falling, I started going to the basket and got some foul shots. I'm just trying to help the team win." 
 -- Gay on his play in the third quarter. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Knicks turned over the ball 17 times, leading to 18 Raptors points, in a tough defensive game that is only decided by two points, that is too much of a margin for error. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Lowry's tough six-foot floater over Chandler's outstretched arm with 28.9 left in the game put Toronto up 97-95. The basket broke a series of seven consecutive ties between both teams and gave the Raptors the lead for good. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We got the switch and they were switching all night. I just wanted to try to get to the basket instead of taking the jump shot. That's a great defender (Chandler), he was the defensive player of the year so I just tried to get it to my right hand, and get the floater off and get the shot over him." 
 -- Lowry on his game-winning shot. 
 
 
 HOT:  Gay erupted in the third, shooting 7-for-9 for the quarter and finishing with 17 points.  He was the catalyst to the Raptors 20-8 run that got them back in the game after being down 51-48 at halftime. He finished with the game with a season-high 32, notching 24 of them in the second half. 
 
 NOT:  A player, a team, either at a point in the game or for the entire game. Can follow with a sentence on how that relates to the player's/team's performance recently (not just in this game). 
 Gay shot 2-for-8 from the field in the first half and 0-for-3 from the field. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Derozan switched his shoes at halftime, after shooting 3-for-7 from the field with eight points and three turnovers. He finished the game with 18 points and 6 assists on 6-for-13 shooting. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Knicks four-game losing streak is their first and longest of the season. The Raptors sellout was the eighth of the season, their most since the 2008-2009 season. A fan ran onto the court during a stoppage in play, but was immediately removed by security. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Raptors; Monday vs. Washington, Wednesday @ Cleveland, Friday vs. Indiana. For the Knicks; Sunday vs. Philadelphia, Wednesday vs. Golden State and Friday @ Washington.
