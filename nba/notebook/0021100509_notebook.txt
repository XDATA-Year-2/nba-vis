  Notebook: Nets 93, Mavericks 92 Posted Tuesday February 28, 2012 11:47PM By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  Playing just his third game of the season because of a broken foot,  Brook Lopez  stomped all over the Mavericks in the Nets' stunning 93-92 victory Tuesday. Lopez scored a season-high 38 points and sank the game-winning free throws with 42.4 seconds left, snapping a 12-game losing streak in Dallas by New Jersey that dated back to March 2, 2000. Deron Williams  added 12 points and 12 assists and  Anthony Morrow  scored 15 points off the bench for New Jersey.  Dirk Nowitzki  (24 points, 10 rebounds) and  Brendan Haywood  (season-high 18 points, 10 boards) posted double-doubles for Dallas, which shot just 36.0 percent against a Nets team that entered the game ranked last in the league in field-goal defense (48.1 percent). QUOTABLE:  "We kind of took the handcuffs off [Lopez] tonight. We weren't putting him on a minute restriction. We've got a pretty good schedule right now and he got a pretty good rest over the break, so we just kept feeding him."   -- Nets head coach  Avery Johnson , who coached Dallas from 2004-08 and played for the Mavericks in 2002-03. THE STAT:  The Mavericks are 1-10 this season when behind entering the fourth quarter. They are also 1-10 in games where they have trailed by 10 or more points. TURNING POINT:  Dallas missed its first 14 shots in the fourth quarter and trailed 89-79 with less than five minutes remaining. That should have clinched it for the Nets, but the Mavs rallied with a 13-2 run and took a brief 92-91 lead on a 3-pointer with 48.9 seconds left by  Jason Kidd . That turned out to be the only basket of the night for Kidd (1-for-7, all from 3-point range). After Lopez converted his two decisive free throws on the next possession, Kidd missed with 25.9 seconds left and then missed a contested 3-pointer at the final buzzer after the Nets' defense had ganged up on Nowitzki. HOT:  Lopez matched his previous season high in the second quarter alone, scoring 15 points on 7-for-9 shooting. He accounted for 13 straight points by the Nets during one stretch. NOT:  Even though one of them didn't count because of a lane violation by the Nets, Nowitzki missed three consecutive free throws at 7:59 of the second quarter. That's about as rare as snow in Dallas for a player who has finished in the top 10 in the NBA in free-throw percentage nine times and entered the game ranked fifth among active players and 14th all-time at 87.7 percent for his career. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Lopez was 17-for-28 from the field and 4-for-5 at the line. Nowitzki was just 7-for-19 from the floor and 7-for-11 at the stripe. Williams was just 3-for-15 and missed his last 10 shots. INSIDE THE ARENA:  About 18 hours after crossing the finish line, 2012 Daytona 500 winner  Matt Kenseth  was at the American Airlines Center. Before the game, he received a basketball autographed by the Mavericks from head coach  Rick Carlisle  and presented Carlisle with a signed hat. ROOKIE WATCH:  Guard  MarShon Brooks  started for the Nets and contributed six points, three assists, two rebounds and two steals. NOTABLE:  New Jersey forward  DeShawn Stevenson  received his 2011 NBA championship ring from the Mavericks during a pregame ceremony. He was center stage at the end of the game, too, getting a hand in Kidd's face and contesting the final shot. ... Dallas began a stretch of nine games over 12 days in seven cities. ... Nets guard  Jordan Farmar  (strained right groin) did not dress. ... Mavs forward  Lamar Odom  (personal reasons) was not with the team and will miss at least one more game. ... A trey by  Jason Terry  with 2:26 left in the third was the 1,720th 3-pointer of his career, moving him past  Dale Ellis  for sixth place on the NBA's all-time list. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Wednesday @ Memphis, Friday @ New Orleans, Saturday vs. Utah. For the Nets, Friday @ Boston, Sunday @ Charlotte, Tuesday @ Miami.
