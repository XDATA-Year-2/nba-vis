  Notebook: Raptors 97, Wolves 87   By Duane Watson, for NBA.com Posted Monday January 9, 2012 11:03PM THE FACTS:  The Toronto Raptors (4-5) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (3-7) 97-87, extending their home game winning streak over the Wolves to eight games. Despite giving up a 12 point lead in the third quarter, the Raptors outscored the Timberwolves 24-18 in the fourth, finishing the game on a 17-7 run.  Amir Johnson  carried the Raptors on his back with gritty play, tough defense and 17 points and 11 rebounds. Andrea Bargnani  led the Raptors with 30 points and 9 rebounds, while  Jose Calderon  contributed 14 points and 6 assists. The Timberwolves were led by  Jose Barea's  came off the bench to lead all Timberwolves scorers with 16 points,  Kevin Love  added 13 points and 14 rebounds, while  Derrick Williams  and  Luke Ridnour  each had 13 points. QUOTABLE:  "We played hard, I think we really played grimy. We really didn't give nobody anything or let them get into they groove, so we really played hard and we got some more and we got to carry it on to the next two games."   --  Amir Johnson  on his team's defensive play in the first of a back-to-back-to-back THE STAT:  The Raptors are second in the league in opponent field goal shooting with (.402). They continued their stifling play on the defensive end of the floor, limiting the Timberwolves to (.342) shooting, holding all but two Timberwolves players to less than 50 percent from the field, (Barea, Ridnour). TURNING POINT:   Amir Johnson  turned an offensive rebound into a put back dunk with 3:14 left in the fourth quarter, breaking a three minute drought between both teams, giving the Raptors an 82-80 lead. That dunk would be the beginning of an 11-2 run that sealed the game for the Raptors. HOT:  Johnson, who was fighting off the flu earlier in the day and missed shoot around, notched his second double-double in as many games, giving him three on the season. Shooting 7-for-9 from the field with 17 points and 11 rebounds, he played on both ends of the floor with a lock down job holding on Kevin Love defensively. NOT:  Despite finishing with 13 points and 14 rebounds,  Kevin Love  had a tough game. Shooting 3-for-16 from the field and 5 for 10 from the free throw line. Even though he logged 36 minutes, Love's last basket of the game came in the waning minutes of the first quarter. NOTABLE:  Much was made about the matchup of Spanish point guards and national squad teammates,  Jose Calderon  and  Ricky Rubio  facing off. Their stat sheets were relatively even, points 16/13, assists 6/6, rebounds 4/3 and turnovers 2/1 for Rubio and Calderon respectively. Field goal shooting was in favor of Calderon who shot 6- for-11, where Rubio went 2-for-9, while the Raptors got the win. UP NEXT:  The next three games for the Raptors -- Tuesday @ Washington, Wednesday vs. Sacramento, Friday vs. Pacers. The Timberwolves next opponents are Tuesday vs. Chicago, Friday vs. New Orleans, and Saturday vs. Atlanta.
