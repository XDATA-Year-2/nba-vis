 THE FACT:  Nearly two months into the season, the Pelicans earned their first win over a team with a winning record. New Orleans' previous 12 victories came against teams with a combined 107-178 record, including two wins each over Memphis and Philadelphia. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Anthony Davis  scored 17 points, including a late momentum-changing dunk, to lead the New Orleans Pelicans past the Denver Nuggets 105-89 Friday night at the New Orleans Arena for their second straight victory. 
 Davis, one of six New Orleans (13-14) players to finish in double figures, also had seven rebounds and four blocked shots. The Pelicans' bench, led by  Tyreke Evans ' 19 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds, outscored Denver's reserves 36-17. 
 Davis scored on an alley-oop from Jrue Holiday after Denver (14-14) had whittled down a 17-point fourth-quarter Pelicans lead largely on  Quincy Miller 's shoulders. He started the 13-2 run with 17-foot step-back jumper.  
 Denver's defense clamped down, forcing four turnovers in the 5½-minute stretch that nearly did in New Orleans. 
 But the dunk by Davis changed the tenor of the final two-plus minutes of the game. New Orleans forced two turnovers and three missed shots on Denver's final  seven possessions and scored on its final five trips down the floor. 
 For New Orleans,  Ryan Anderson  finished with a double-double, putting up 16 points while bringing down 10 rebounds while Holiday added 17 points. 
 Denver was led by  Wilson Chandler 's 22 points while  JJ Hickson  added 16 and 10 rebounds and  Ty Lawson  had 14 and 12 assists. 
 
 QUOTABLE:   "You look at the numbers and I just feel like he has the ability to have monster games. And so I feel like he's playing OK. But I know how good he can be. He has the ability to go for 25 and 20."  -- Pelicans coach  Monty Williams  on  Davis 
 
 
 THE STAT:   53-42. Williams, the Pelicans coach, recalled before the game that one of the factors in a nine-point loss at Denver 12 days earlier was getting outrebounded by 19. Friday night, New Orleans flipped the script, outrebounding the Nuggets by 11, including 15-11 on the offensive glass. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  After Davis' alley-oop stopped Denver's comeback, the Pelicans answered with a 6-0 run buoyed by defensive stops. First,  Jordan Hamilton  was off on a long-range 3-pointer and Davis answered with a layup. On the ensuing possession, Lawson turned the ball over, throwing it out of bounds. Holiday's floater pushed the lead back to 12. Then, Chandler missed a 24-footer, Holiday picked Miller's pocket and Evans finished with a layup that all but sealed the game. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We dug ourselves a hole and were expending a lot of our energy trying to come back. We played catch-up from that point on and could never get back."  -- Nuggets coach  Brian Shaw  on a first quarter in which New Orleans outscored his team 34-25 
 
 NOT:   Denver's bench didn't help the team much Friday night. Five players went a combined 7-for-20 from the floor and picked up just six rebounds. 
 
 NOTABLE:   Chandler's 22 points and nine rebounds were a season high for the Denver forward. ... Pelicans reserve forward  Darius Miller  scored a season-high 11 points, hitting three of the four 3-pointers he attempted. ... New Orleans' Anderson has hit a 3-pointer in 18 straight games to start his season. ... Denver's Lawson finished with his sixth double-double of the season (14 points, 12 assists). 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Pelicans, Saturday @ Houston, Monday vs. Portland, Wednesday @ Minnesota. For the Nuggets, Saturday @ Memphis, Monday vs. Miami, Wednesday vs. Philadelphia.
