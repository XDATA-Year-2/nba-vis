 THE FACT: Jeff Teague  scored a career-high 33 points against the Philadelphia 76ers on Friday night. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Teague's 33 points led three Atlanta starters with at least 20 points as the Hawks (5-4) downed the Philadelphia 76ers (5-5), 113-103, Friday night at Philips Arena. Teague, who shot 10-for-16 and 12-for-13 from the foul line, also dished out 11 assists. The Hawks have won three of four and are now 3-1 at home.  DeMarre Carroll  added a career-high 21 for Atlanta and  Al Horford  chipped in 20 and had a team-high eight rebounds and a game-high three blocked shots. Hawks guard Lou Williams made his return after missing 10 months due to tearing his right ACL.   
 
 Evan Turner  led Philadelphia with 27 points, while guard  Tony Wroten  added 22 and center  Spencer Hawes  had a 14-point, 12-rebound double-double. The Sixers, have dropped three of four and five of seven.  
 
 THE STAT:  19 -- Teague was the reason Philadelphia was unable to close the gap on Atlanta in the fourth quarter. Teague was responsible for 24 points in the quarter, scoring 15 points (six of his eight shooting, three-for-three from the line), while handing out four assists, which led to nine points. More important, five of Teague's six field goals, two of his three foul shots and three of his four assists (accounting for seven points) answered 76ers points. 
 
 TURNING POINT : Carroll's 29-foot buzzer-beater just before the half not only cut Philadelphia's lead to two, 56-54, going into the locker room but gave Atlanta new life. Carroll's shot, set up by  Lou Williams'  hustle in getting the ball to him, came only 2.5 seconds after a  Darius Morris  dagger 3 pushed Philly's lead to five. It would turn out to be the Sixers' biggest lead of the game, and for a moment took the life out of the Philips Arena crowd. Carroll's 3-pointer gave woke up the Hawks, who came out more energetic in the second half, outscoring Philadelphia, 28-17, in the third, doubling them up in the paint, and forcing six turnovers, the most in any quarter by the Sixers. 
 
 HOT : Philadelphia shot a sizzling 70.8 percent in the second quarter in outscoring Atlanta 39-29 and getting back in the game. The Sixers outscored Atlanta 26-4 in the paint in the stanza. Wroten had nine points on 4-for-5 shooting with two assists and a steal, and had a six-point burst in 47 seconds that gave Philly a lead. Forward  Thaddeus Young  added nine points on 4-of-6 shooting with three rebounds, all on the offensive end and all three coming on the same possession late in the quarter. 
 
 HOT:  Carroll not only scored a career-high 21 points, he set a career-high by sinking five 3-pointers. Carroll hit three in the second quarter alone, to match his previous career-best done twice previously. His season-best had been two done twice this season, most recently on Nov. 9 against Orlando at Philips Arena. 
 
 NOT:  The Sixers started the game missing their first seven 3-point field goal attempts and never really heated up. They made only 5-of-19 from downtown, a 26.3 percent success rate, matching their season-low, which came on Monday against San Antonio. Atlanta made 10 of 23, a 10-point difference in a 10-point game. It marked the eighth time in 10 games that Philadelphia has been out-shot from three. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Jeff Teague is a tough handle. He did just about everything on the court except post up."  
 --  Philadelphia forward  Y oung  on Teague. 
 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "Al [Horford] and those guys were telling me to use my speed and just try to get to the rim. It was working out for me to day."  --  T eague. 
 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  With rookie  Michael Carter-Williams  sitting out with an injury, the sizzle was lacking among first-year players.  Hollis Thompson  had the best night among neophytes. The 6-foot-8 forward out of Georgetown scored five points in 14:09, making two of his three shots, 1-of-2 from behind the arc, grabbed nine rebounds and made a steal.  
 
 NOTABLE:  The 113 points scored by Atlanta was a season-high and is the most points allowed by Philadelphia in a regulation game ? it's also the most allowed over any four-quarter stretch this season...Former Atlanta Braves third baseman  Chipper Jones  continued his torment of all teams Philadelphia, as he was in attendance...Atlanta guard Williams entered the game with the 4:23 left in the first quarter to a chorus of "Loooooooou" and responded by hitting his first two shots, a slashing layup at 1:17 then a 3-pointer at 8.8 seconds. For the game, he played 16:01, scoring seven points on 3-for-8 shooting, 1-for-3 from three, grabbed three rebounds, handed out two assists and had a steal...Philadelphia's Thaddeus Young, who played at Georgia Tech, continued to thrive against Atlanta. He came in averaging 13.2 points and 5.2 rebounds for his career against the Hawks. He had 13 and six at the half on Friday and finished with 17 and seven...Sixers guard Wroten, who had a triple-double in his first NBA start on Wednesday, again was lights-out, scoring 22 points on 9-of-19. That's 55 points in two starts on 16-for-37 ? he has struggled from 3, however, going 0-for-5 in the two games after an 0-for-3 Friday. Wroten's six assists vs. only one turnover give him 17 assists to five turnovers in his two games as a starter...Atlanta shot 16-for-16 from the free-throw line in the second half (11-for-11 in the third quarter, 5-for-5 in the fourth). They'd made only 9-of-15 (60 percent) in the first half. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Hawks, Saturday @ New York, Tuesday @ Miami, Wednesday vs. Detroit. For the 76ers, Saturday @ New Orleans, Monday @ Dallas, Wednesday vs. Toronto.
