  Sixers-Trail Blazers notebook   By Kerry Eggers, for NBA.com Posted Tuesday December 27, 2011 12:09PM THE FACTS:  The Trail Blazers broke out to a 16-point fourth-quarter lead, then held on for a 107-103 victory over the 76ers in their opener Monday night at the Rose Garden.  LaMarcus Aldridge  collected 25 points, seven rebounds and three blocked shots for Portland.  Lou Williams  came off the bench for 25 points -- 12 in the second quarter, 13 in the fourth -- to lead Philadelphia. QUOTABLE:  "Normally you get seven or eight exhibition games; we got two. Everybody's somewhat in exhibition mode. But to learn from a victory is a lot better than learning from defeat."    -- Portland's  Jamal Crawford THE STAT:  Portland turned 20 Philadelphia turnovers into 28 points. The 76ers scored 15 points off 12 Trail Blazer miscues. The Blazers were 7 of 10 from 3-point range in the second half after going 2 of 9 from beyond the stripe in the first half. TURNING POINT:  Portland led 77-74 early in the fourth quarter when  Nicolas Batum  touched off a 15-3 run with a 20-footer just as the shot clock was expiring. HOT:  Williams scored the Sixers' last 10 points, burying four straight shots in the final 1:57. NOT:  Portland's starting backcourt of  Wesley Matthews  and  Raymond Felton  each finished 4 for 14 from the field. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Fans were jacked for NBA basketball's return as the Blazers notched their 160th straight sellout at the Rose Garden. GOOD MOVE:  McMillan turned his front line loose on the offensive boards.  Gerald Wallace , Aldridge and  Marcus Camby  combined for 12 of Portland's 17 rebounds off the offensive glass. BAD MOVE:  With Portland ahead 106-103 and the clock winding down under 10 seconds,  Andre Iguodala  could have taken an uncontested 3-pointer. He hesitated, and by the time he launched a shot, Aldridge had a hand in his face. The trey missed, the Blazers rebounded and Felton's free throw clinched it. NOTABLE:  Philadelphia's  Spencer Hawes  fell one assist short of his first career triple-double with 10 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists. UP NEXT:  For the Blazers, Tuesday vs. Sacramento, Thursday vs. Denver, Sunday @ L.A. Clippers. For the 76ers, Wednesday @ Phoenix, Friday @ Utah, Saturday @ Golden State.
