  Notebook: Clippers 100, Thunder 98 Posted Thursday April 12, 2012 12:26AM By Randy Renner, for NBA.com THE FACTS:   Chris Paul  controlled the second half and his Los Angeles Clippers teammates dominated inside and beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 100-98 inside a sold-out Chesapeake Energy Arena Wednesday night. Paul had only seven points on 3-for-9 shooting in the first half but after the break he had 24 on 8-for-11 shooting including the game-winner, a driving layup that he flipped into the basket with :08.8 left on the clock. Oklahoma City managed just 43 points in the second half and couldn't keep the Clippers out of the painted area where they scored 52 points, 30 more than they had the last time these teams played.  Blake Griffin  added 16 points for the Clippers while pulling down 12 rebounds. Thunder All-Stars  Kevin Durant  (7-for-21) and  Russell Westbrook  (3-for-14) did not have good shooting nights though Westbrook made it to the free throw line 15 times and made 13 of those tries. Durant led the Thunder with 22 points, three of them coming on a long-range bomb that tied the game at 98 with :32.2 to go. Durant then missed a 3-pointer that would have given OKC the lead with :01.9 left. Thanks to those charity tosses Westbrook added 20. OKC sixth man  James Harden  had 17 on 4-for-8 shooting. Many of the Thunder players were upset after the game and most were already showered, dressed and out of the locker room by the time reporters were allowed in. QUOTABLE:  "Chris (Paul) made plays down the stretch. He's just got that competitive edge about everything. His attitude and his approach rubs off on guys and he was locked in tonight."   -- Clippers head coach  Vinny Del Negro THE STAT:  In the fourth quarter Paul scored 11 points on 5-for-6 shooting. Durant was 2-for-9 (five points) and Westbrook was 0-for-3 (two points). TURNING POINT:  The Thunder managed to keep the Clippers at arms-length until the fourth quarter when L.A. tied it at 80 then gradually pulled away thanks to those 11 points from Paul and 16 points in the paint in the final frame. Oklahoma City could score only 18 points, their worst quarter of the game, in the fourth. QUOTABLE II:  "Not giving them buckets around the paint was one of our keys tonight. It was not one of our better games. On defense we were a second or a step slow and we didn't have it on offense. We didn't play good enough to win tonight."   -- Thunder head coach  Scott Brooks HOT:  Oklahoma City started the game shooting 7-for-13 (53.8 percent) ...  Derek Fisher  was 3-for-4 and 2-for-2 on 3-pointers at halftime ...  Caron Butler  was 3-for-4 at the break. NOT:  The Clippers started the game shooting 4-for-12 (33.3 percent) ... Paul a 1-for-5 in the first quarter ... Westbrook was 2-for-7 at halftime ... Through three quarters Durant (5-for-12), Westbrook (3-for-11) and Harden (2-for-5) were a combined 10-for-28 (35.7 percent). INSIDE THE ARENA:  Country music superstar and Oklahoma native  Toby Keith  along with St. Louis Rams quarterback and Oklahoma City native  Sam Bradford  were among the sell-out crowd of 18,203. It is the 44th straight regular season full house and the 53rd consecutive including playoffs. ... Durant wore a new shoe, the NikeN7, to help promote participation in sport by Native Americans. BAD MOVE:  Fisher drove toward the basket in the second quarter from out near the 3-point arc and Clippers backup point guard  Eric Bledsoe  inexplicably stepped away from Fisher allowing him a clear path to the basket. Fisher took advantage and scored. Bledsoe looked around as if he'd been expecting some help. NOTABLE:  The Clippers are now 12 games over .500, it's just the third time ever they've been more than five games over .500 this late in a season. UP NEXT:  For the Clippers, Thursday @ Minnesota, Saturday vs. Golden State, Monday vs. Oklahoma City. For the Thunder, Friday vs. Sacramento, Saturday @ Minnesota, Monday @ LA Clippers.
