  Notebook: Heat 106, Wizards 89 Posted Friday February 10, 2012 11:37PM By Rich Dubroff, for NBA.com THE FACTS: Dwyane Wade  scored 26 points,  Chris Bosh  added 24 and had 11 rebounds and  LeBron James  had 18 to lead the Miami Heat to a 106-89 win over the Washington Wizards on Friday night. Wade and James combined for the last 18 points of the second quarter as Miami took a 52-42 halftime lead. Washington closed to within 64-63 with 3:14 to play in the third quarter. The Heat outscored the Wizards 19-5 to take an 83-68 lead with 9:51 to play. Miami won its ninth in the past 11. JaVale McGee  had a season-high 24 points for Washington, which dropped to 5-22. Nick Young added 22. QUOTABLE:  "It was very fun. That's why we play this game. He makes me look good, so I think that's what the fans came to see. They love to see their favorite players do amazing things."   -- Wade on the series of highlight plays he and James combined on late in the first half THE STAT:  Wade and Bosh scored 20 or more points in the same game for just the second time this season. Wade, Bosh and James haven't scored 20 or more in the same game this season. TURNING POINT:  When the Wizards got within a point, supporting players chipped in on the 19-5 run. James had five, Bosh four, but  Mike Miller  had two 3-pointers and rookie  Norris Cole  had four points. QUOTABLE II:  "Nobody wants to see that show going against you. I thought we had a little bit of a show of our own."   -- Washington coach  Randy Wittman  on his team trying to match Miami's spectacular plays . HOT:  The Heat's  Shane Battier  added a season-high 15 points on 6-for-9 from the field. He was 3-for-6 from the 3-point line. NOT:  Wizards guard  Jordan Crawford  missed 10 of 12 from the field. In his last two games, Crawford is just 4-for-22. GOOD MOVE:  Miami coach  Erik Spoelstra  played Battier in the fourth quarter, and he secured the win with 10 fourth-quarter points. BAD MOVE:  Washington rookie  Chris Singleton  trying to guard James. He looked helpless. McGee admitted that sometimes his teammates look starstruck. "Sometimes, they see LeBron out there. They see D-Wade out there. They say: 'Oh my God, he's going to work on them.' Sometimes the guys don't go out there and play like they're any other play," McGee said. NOTABLE:  The Wizards shot just 4-for-21 from the 3-point line. In their last two games, they're just 6-for-38 from long range. IN THE ARENA:  The Heat drew the first sellout of the season to the Verizon Center -- 20,282 -- and most were cheering for Miami UP NEXT:  For the Heat: Sunday @ Atlanta, Monday @ Milwaukee, Tuesday @ Indiana; For the Wizards: Sunday @ Detroit, Tuesday @ Portland, Wednesday @ L.A.
