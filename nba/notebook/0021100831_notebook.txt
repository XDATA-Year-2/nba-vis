  Notebook: Bucks 116, Trail Blazers 94 Posted Sunday April 8, 2012 12:04AM By Rick Braun, for NBA.com THE FACTS: Beno Udrih  and  Brandon Jennings  each scored 21 points, and Milwaukee doubled up Portland by a 62-31 margin in the second half, as the Bucks pulled away to a 116-94 victory over the Trail Blazers Saturday night at the Bradley Center. Udrih added six assists to his season-high scoring output, and  Ersan Ilyasova  added 20 points and 12 rebounds as the Bucks (28-28) won their fourth straight and got back to .500 for the first time since they were 2-2. Since being 15-24 they've won 13 of their last 17 games. LaMarcus Aldridge  scored 21 for Portland (27-30), but the Trail Blazers were hammered on the boards, 49-33. QUOTABLE:  "We knew coming in Portland was tired from the overtime win last night in Dallas, the long flight and everything, so once we made that push we never looked back."  --  Jennings on the Bucks' huge second half. THE STAT:  Midway through the second quarter the Trail Blazers were shooting 68 percent (17-of-25). From that point on they went 17 of 53 (32.1 percent) the rest of the way. TURNING POINT:  Maybe it wasn't so much the turning point as it was the dagger, but when Jennings drilled a step-back 3-pointer with the shot clock running down to make it 99-88 with 6:34 left, the fight went out of the Trail Blazers. QUOTABLE II:  "I think it would have been a big blow if we hadn't gotten there. It would have been, 'Aw, man,' with the week we have coming up. It's almost like a relief, and not we can go ahead with some momentum and hopefully beat some teams this week."  --  Bucks sixth man  Mike Dunleavy  on the team reaching .500 for the first time since 2-2. HOT:  Udrih made 9-of-15 shots, including 3-of-4 on 3-pointers, and Ilyasova went 8-for-14 and made all four of his 3-pointers. But the real "hot" award goes to second-year man  Larry Sanders , who scored a season-best 14 on 7-of-8 shooting. NOT:  Portland's starting backcourt of  Raymond Felton  and  Wesley Matthews  combined to go just 8-for-23 (34.8 percent). One night earlier Felton had gone 12 for 18 to score 30 points. GOOD MOVE:  Bucks head coach  Scott Skiles  gave his team a good chewing out a night earlier when Milwaukee struggled to get past 7-46 Charlotte. The players seemed to take his words to heart ... at least after the first half. ROOKIE WATCH:  First-round pick  Tobias Harris  and second-rounder  Jon Leuer  both got in for the final 2:16 and each scored a basket for the Bucks. NOTABLE: Carlos Delfino  and  Drew Gooden  both returned to the Bucks' starting lineup. Gooden had missed the previous two games with a sore back, and Delfino had missed the previous six with a groin strain. ... The last time the Bucks had a chance to get back to .500 was Feb. 3 at Detroit. They turned in one of their worst performances of the season to fall to 10-12 and went as many as nine games under .500 after that. ... The Bucks pulled within a half-game of New York for the eighth playoff spot, and 1 1/2 of Philadelphia for seventh place in the East. ... The Bucks swept the two-game season series with Portland by a cumulative 51 points. ... UP NEXT:  For the Trail Blazers, Monday vs. Houston, Wednesday vs. Golden State, Friday vs. Dallas. For the Bucks, Monday vs. Oklahoma City, Wednesday vs. New York, Friday @ Detroit.
