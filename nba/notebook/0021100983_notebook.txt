  Notebook: Hawks 106, Mavericks 89 Posted Thursday April 26, 2012 11:14PM By Matt Winkeljohn, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  Both teams had something on the line Thursday when the Mavericks closed the regular season in Atlanta, but the Hawks had far more riding than the visitors and it showed as the home team raced to a huge lead on the way to a 106-89 win. That clinched home-court advantage for Atlanta (40-26) in its first-round playoff series against Boston (39-27). The Hawks ran out to a 31-11 lead in the first quarter against Dallas, who did not look like the defending NBA champions while landing in the No. 7 spot in the West. They'll play at Oklahoma City Saturday. As it turned out, even if the Mavs (36-30) had won they would have fare no better because Denver beat Minnesota to earn the sixth seed and a date with the Lakers. Josh Smith  had 12 points, seven rebounds, five assists and a steal in the first quarter, and finished with game highs of 23 points, nine rebounds, seven assists.  Jeff Teague  added 17 points for Atlanta, which shot 52.9 percent. Jason Kidd  did not play for Dallas as coach  Rick Carlisle  rested him for the second game in a row, and  Dirk Nowitzki  led the Mavericks with 22 points while playing a modest 26:09. He did not play in the fourth quarter as the Mavs lost their second straight game. QUOTABLE:  "It feels good. We definitely wanted to be able to get home court advantage. We understand the importance of it, and we came out like a team on a mission tonight."   -- Josh Smith. THE STAT:  The Hawks beat the Mavs every which way other than at the free-throw line, but their 50-38 edge in the paint was most significant. TURNING POINT:  Tied at 6, the Hawks went on a 25-5 run during which Smith had 10 points, four rebounds and four assists. Game over. QUOTABLE II:  "I thought the first quarter was horrible. [Oklahoma City] is a great, young team. We had an intense series with them last year. We don't have a lot of prep time."   -- Rick Carlisle. HOT:  The Hawks made 16-for-23 shots (69.6 percent) in the first quarter on the way to a 38-21 lead. Smith was 5-for-6,  Joe Johnson  4-for-6 and Atlanta starters were 14-for-20. . . . Nowitzki made all seven of his free throws and finished the regular season making 40-for-41 over Dallas' final six games. NOT:  Dallas sub  Dominque Jones  missed all five of his shots. He did grab a season-high six rebounds, however. IN THE ARENA:  Former Falcons running back  Jamal Anderson , who rushed for 1,846 yards on an NFL-record 410 carries while leading Atlanta to Super Bowl XXXIII following the 1998 season, was in the house. NOTABLE:  Hawks center  Zaza Pachulia  missed his seventh straight game with a sprained left foot, and coach  Larry Drew  said, "I'm not getting my hopes up," for his return for Game 1 Sunday. . . . Reserve point guard  Jannero Pargo  missed the game for Atlanta with a stiff back. . . .In addition to losing to the Celtics in seven games in the first round of the 2008 playoffs, the Hawks lost in seven games to Boston in 1988 -- when Celtics coach  Doc Rivers  played for Atlanta -- after failing to clinch the series in Game 6 in Atlanta. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Saturday @ Oklahoma City. For the Hawks, Sunday vs. Boston.
