 THE FACT:  The Washington Wizards won their eighth game in November for the first time since 1984.  
 
 THE LEAD:   John Wall  scored 26 points and had 12 assists.  Trevor Ariza  had 24 points as the Wizards beat the Atlanta Hawks 108-101 on Saturday night. 
 The Wizards have won six of eight and took the lead in the game's first 90 seconds, and never relinquished it. The Hawks cut the lead to 81-79 with 9:42 to play, but couldn't come closer. 
 
 Paul Millsap  led the Hawks with 23 points and 10 rebounds.  Al Horford  had 16 points. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We're showing growth. We're showing maturity. I feel we're ready to take the next step and become a playoff team." --  Ariza on Washington's play. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Ariza and  Marte l l Webster  were 10-for-15 from the 3-point line. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  After the Hawks cut the lead to two, Ariza hit two 3-pointers to help keep Atlanta away.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It's not a habit we want to get into as a team. It takes too much energy, too much effort. We did it yesterday. Yeah, it was great. We want to be playing well and get ahead in games." --  Horford on the Hawks falling behind and not catching up. 
 
 
 HOT:  Ariza was 7-for-10 from the field, including 5-for-6 from the 3-point line, and he made all five of his free throws. 
 
 NOT: Jeff Teague  was just 5-for-18 from the field for the Hawaks. 
 
 GOOD MOVE: Nene , who sat out Friday's game with an injury to his right Achilles tendon, had 13 points and 12 rebounds. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Teague missing shot after shot and committing five turnovers. 
 
 NOTABLE:  With an 8-9 record, Washington is tied for fifth in the Eastern Conference... Atlanta has lost four of its last five games...The Hawks recorded a season-low 19 assists...Nene pulled down a season-high 12 rebounds...Saturday night marked the Wizards' fourth straight home win...this is also their sixth win in their last eight games. Millsap had his third game this season with 20 points and 10 rebounds.  
 
 IN THE ARENA: Lou Williams  watched and didn't play. He's not yet up to playing back-to-back games because he's still recovering from knee surgery last January.  Kyle Korver  wasn't with the team. He missed his third straight game with a bruised rib.  
 
 UP NEXT:   For the Hawks: Monday @ San Antonio, Wednesday vs. Los Angeles Clippers, Friday vs. Cleveland. For the Wizards: Monday vs. Orlando, Friday vs. Milwaukee, Dec. 9 vs. Denver
