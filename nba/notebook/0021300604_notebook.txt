 THE FACT:  The Bucks have lost nine straight games and have the worst record in the NBA by 3½ games after losing by 28 points Sunday in San Antonio. They have not won yet in the new year. 
 
 THE LEAD:  With  Tony Parker t aking the night off to rest a shin contusion,  Patty Mills  came off the bench for 20 points to lead the San Antonio Spurs to a 110-82 win over the Milwaukee Bucks at AT&T Center. Parker could use the rest with Oklahoma City coming to town on Wednesday and an NBA Finals rematch later in the week at Miami. 
 Seven players for the Spurs (32-9) hit double figures.  Tim Duncan  had 11 points and 13 rebounds in almost 28 minutes before sitting the entire fourth quarter. Though Parker,  Matt Bonner  (broken nose),  Danny Green  (broken finger) and  Tiago Splitte r (sprained shoulder) missed the game for the Spurs, sparsely used players  Cory Joseph  (12 points in 26 minutes),  Aron Baynes  (13 points in 14 minutes),  Nando De Colo  (13 points, 25 minutes) and  Malcolm Thomas  (nine rebounds, 14 minutes) hit the floor. 
 The Bucks (7-33) have not won since Dec. 31.  Brandon Knight  scored 21 points and  John Henson  had 10 points and 11 rebounds. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "You want to do your job as early as you can. Today was one of those games you had to win pretty comfortably. Everybody got to play, and everybody played well."  
 -- Spurs guard  Manu Ginobili 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Every player in a Spurs uniform saw action. San Antonio's bench shot 23-for-41 from the floor (56 percent) and scored more than half the team's points (58). 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Milwaukee led 16-14 with 4:13 left in the first quarter on  Miroslav Raduljica 's close-in jumper. But Mills hit a 3-pointer on the next possession, and it started a 15-0 run to close out the quarter. Most of the run came with a Spurs rotation of  Jeff Ayers ,  Marco Belinelli , Baynes, Ginobili and Mills. The closest the Bucks got after that was 11 points late in the first half. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It's the way they play. They move the ball. They make the right play, and they hit the open shot. That sytem has been in effect for a long time, and it's been successful for a long time. You know what you're going to get. It's just a matter of going out there and stopping it. A lot of teams haven't figured out how to stop it."  
 -- Bucks guard  Gary Nea l , who played his first three NBA seasons in San Antonio 
 
 
 HOT:  Mills broke out of a 6-for-18 shooting slump (1-for-7 from the 3-point line) over his past three games with a 8-for-12 performance Sunday from the floor (4-for-6 on 3-pointers). 
 
 NOT:   Luke Ridnour  has been playing solidly for the Bucks on offense (9-for-16 his last two games including 5-for-8 3-point shooting), but he shot 1-for-5 on Sunday before checking out with a right wrist sprain. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Knight fell short of scoring at least 25 points in three straight games, which would have been a career first. He scored 27 points Wednesday against Memphis, 26 at Houston on Saturday). He did not play in the fourth quarter Sunday. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:   Giannis Antetokounmpo  got his 16th start of the season and finished with 11 points in 30 minutes. He was the only Bucks starter to play in the fourth quarter. ...  Nate Wolters  had a career-high 18 points the last time the Bucks played the Spurs (Dec. 11); on Sunday he played 12 minutes and scored nine points. 
 
 NOTABLE: Caron Butler  missed the game after turning up sick Sunday morning. ... Neal, who was last seen in San Antonio hitting 3-pointers by the bunches in the Spurs' appearance in the NBA Finals, played his first game for Milwaukee since Jan. 4 (1-for-8, three points in almost 18 minutes); he was reported ill Saturday in Houston but saw his playing time cut the past two weeks since arguing two weeks ago with  Larry Sanders . 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Bucks, Wednesday vs. Detroit, Friday @ Cleveland, Saturday vs. Atlanta. For the Spurs, Wednesday vs. Oklahoma City, Friday @ Atlanta, Sunday @ Miami.
