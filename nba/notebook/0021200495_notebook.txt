 THE FACTS: Eric Gordon  converted a three-point play with 4.7 seconds left in overtime Saturday as the New Orleans Hornets rallied for a rare 99-96 victory at Dallas. The Mavericks fell to 0-7 in overtime this season and have now dropped 10 straight in OT, matching an NBA record shared by Atlanta, Golden State and Minnesota. 
 Making just his third appearance and his first start of the season, Gordon poured in the last eight points in overtime for the Hornets (8-25), who had lost 19 of their last 20 at the American Airlines Center. Gordon pump-faked  Darren Collison  off his feet, drew contact and banked in a 16-footer near the foul line, adding the free throw for the decisive points. 
 
 Greivis Vasquez  scored 15 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter and added nine assists and seven rebounds for New Orleans.  Ryan Anderson  sank four 3-pointers and finished with 16 points. 
 Despite having  Dirk Nowitzki  back in the starting lineup for the first time, the fading Mavericks (13-21) lost for the 11th time in 13 games. Nowitzki led the Mavericks with 20 points, but attempted only one shot in the extra session.  O.J. Mayo  was 1-for-4 in overtime, missing two open corner 3-pointers, and finished with 14 points on 5-for-17 shooting.  Vince Carter  had 17 off the bench, but his 23-footer at the final buzzer hit the iron. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "That's why he's a big-time two-guard in this league. That's what they do -- they win games at the end." 
 -- Greivis Vasquez on Eric Gordon 
 
 THE STAT:  Dallas has lost four straight at home for the first time since starting 0-4 in 2008-09. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Hornets erased an 11-point deficit by outscoring the Mavericks 30-13 from the 5:14 mark of the third quarter through 7:12 of the fourth. New Orleans won for the first time this season when trailing after three quarters (1-19). 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We can't guard nobody." 
 -- Mavericks forward  Shawn Marion 
 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "Yeah, it feels like it. I still believe in the team and I like the guys. This is just a tough time and it's important that everybody sticks together and we've got to fight through it." 
 -- Mavericks head coach  Rick Carlisle  when asked if this loss was "rock bottom." 
 
 HOT:  Vasquez was 3-for-4 from 3-point range in the fourth quarter. 
 
 NOT:  Mayo finished 1-for-7 from behind the arc. ... Nowitzki missed a big free throw with 18.5 seconds left in regulation. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Moving  Al-Farouq Aminu  back into the starting lineup paid off for the Hornets. He registered a double-double with 10 points, a game-high 13 rebounds, three assists, three steals and one blocked shot. It was his first double-double since Nov. 21 at Indiana. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  New Orleans Saints head coach  Sean Payton  attended the game and sat behind the Hornets' bench. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Hornets forward  Anthony Davis  only played 12:09, tallying four points, one rebound and three personal fouls. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Mavericks have now used 15 different starting lineups in 34 games, a league high. ... New Orleans' 40 first-half points matched a season low by a Mavericks opponent. ... Collison scored in double figures for the seventh straight game with 12 points, his longest stretch of the season. ...  Elton Brand  set a season high with five blocked shots for Dallas. ... The Mavericks' record for most overtime games in a season is eight (1995-96, 1997-98 and 2009-10). 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Monday @ Utah, Wednesday @ L.A. Clippers, Thursday @ Sacramento. For the Hornets, Monday vs. San Antonio, Wednesday vs. Houston, Friday vs. Minnesota.
