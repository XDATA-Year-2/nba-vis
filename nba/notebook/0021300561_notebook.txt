 THE FACT:  The Jazz topped the Nuggets in a fast-paced shootout to snap Denver's five-game winning streak. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Despite missing top scorer  Gordon Hayward  to a hip injury for the second straight game, the Utah Jazz withstood a fourth-quarter rally by the Denver Nuggets to come away with a 118-103 win Monday night at EnergySolutions Arena. 
 In Hayward's absence, the trio of  Alec Burks, Derrick Favors  and  Trey Burke  stepped up to push Utah's record to 13-26 for the season. Burks went 13-for-19 from the field and 8-for-8 from the line to score a career-high 34 points. Favors finished with a double-double (19 points, 15 rebounds) while Burke scored 18 points and dished out eight assists. 
 
 Ty Lawson  led Denver with 23 points, and  J.J. Hickson  scored 21 from his starting center spot.  Evan Fournier  added 16 points in 37 minutes off the bench for the Nuggets, who dropped to 19-18 with the loss. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "With Gordon being out we needed a guy to step up, and [Alec] did a great job making some huge plays for us down the stretch." 
 -- Jazz coach  Tyrone Corbin 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Utah shot a blistering 55.7 percent from the field, including 8-for-18 (44.4 percent) from 3-point range. As a group, Utah's starters went 34-for-58 (58.6 percent) for the game. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Denver had whittled Utah's 24-point lead down to 13 with just over nine minutes left in the fourth quarter when Burks drove his way into the lane and somehow managed to drain a twisting layup while getting fouled by  Nate Robinson . Burks hit the free throw to halt Denver's momentum and give Utah a 98-82 lead. 
 
 HOT:  It was in a losing cause, but Hickson was on fire from beginning to end Monday night. Denver's center went 8-for-9 from the field, including a handful of soaring slam dunks, and 5-for-6 from the free-throw line to finish with 21 points. He also grabbed 10 rebounds and registered two blocks in 31 minutes. 
 
 NOT:  Denver point guards Lawson (6-for-18 shooting) and Robinson (1-for-7) struggled from the field. Lawson led Denver in scoring thanks in large part to his free-throw shooting (11-for-15), but he also missed a pair of free throws that would have cut Utah's lead to single digits with two minutes left in the game. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We went through a stretch there where we couldn't stop them from making shots and we couldn't make a shot, but we stayed together as a team and came out with a win." 
 -- Derrick Favors 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  The win was No. 100 for Corbin since he took over as Utah's head coach midway through the 2010-11 season. ... Denver's  Randy Foye , who played for the Jazz last season, finished with 10 points (including eight in the last six minutes of the game) to extend his streak of double-digit scoring games to nine. ... Utah recorded a season high for points in a half with 67 first-half points, and only turned the ball over once in the first 24 minutes. ...  Marvin Williams  started and played 24 minutes for Utah despite suffering from flu-like symptoms earlier in the day. ... Lawson, who had a game-high 11 assists, has now had 10-plus assists in six of the last seven games. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Nuggets, Wednesday @ Golden State, Friday vs. Cleveland, Sunday @ Phoenix. For the Jazz, Wednesday @ San Antonio, Friday @ Detroit, Saturday @ Minnesota.
