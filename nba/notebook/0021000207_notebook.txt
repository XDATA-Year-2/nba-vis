  Pistons-Mavericks Notebook   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Tuesday November 23, 2010 11:55PM THE FACTS:   Dirk Nowitzki  had a season-high 42 points and 12 rebounds as the Dallas Mavericks rallied Tuesday to defeat the Detroit Pistons 88-84 at the American Airlines Center.  Jason Terry  added 16 points and  Jason Kidd  dished 10 assists as Dallas defeated Detroit for the fifth consecutive time.  Rodney Stuckey  and  Tayshaun Prince  scored 19 each to pace the Pistons, who led by 12 in the third quarter and were ahead by five entering the fourth. QUOTABLE:  "We would have loved to get an easy win tonight and get some rest, but sometimes you have to grind it out. We're going to have an unbelievable challenge tomorrow night at Oklahoma City." --  Nowitzki,  whose Mavericks played the first of four games in five nights. THE STAT:  Nowitzki (15) and Terry (nine) combined to score 24 of the Mavericks' last 25 points. TURNING POINT : Nowitzki was 3-for-3 from behind the arc. His 3-pointer with 6:09 remaining put the Mavericks on top for good at 73-70. This was Nowitzki's 16th career 40-point game. QUOTABLE II:  "The fourth period, we didn't sustain defensively the way we had been playing in the third period. We needed that second group who did a great job in the second period to play the same way, and we just didn't have the same energy." --  Detroit head coach  John Kuester . HOT:  The Mavericks scored a season-high 32 fourth-quarter points, matching their combined total from the second and third quarters. Dallas shot 60 percent (9-for-15) from the field and went 12-for-14 at the line in the final period to clinch the victory. ... Stuckey was 10-for-10 at the charity stripe. NOT:  Detroit's  Richard Hamilton  missed his first five shots, sat the entire second quarter and finished with five points on 1-for-7 shooting. Teammate  Charlie Villanueva  had only two points (13 below his season average) and racked up five fouls in 17:30. ... Other than Nowitzki, the rest of the Mavericks shot 31 percent (17-for-55). The team shot a season-worst 38.5 percent. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Detroit's  Tracy McGrady  played nearly 20 minutes and finished with six points, four rebounds, four assists, one steal and one blocked shot. ROOKIE WATCH:  Center  Greg Monroe  topped the Pistons with eight rebounds (four on the offensive glass), two off his season high. NOTABLE:  With just 14 points on 5-for-20 shooting, the Mavericks posted their lowest-scoring second quarter of the season. Their previous low was 20 points against New Orleans on Nov. 15. ... Dallas tied its season low with eight turnovers. ... The Mavericks raced to a 16-2 lead to start the game. ... Detroit outscored Dallas 36-18 in the paint.
