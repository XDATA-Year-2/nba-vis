 THE FACTS: Ersan Ilyasova  scored 27 points and grabbed 16 rebounds, and  Brandon Jennings  added 25 points and seven assists as the Milwaukee Bucks coasted to a 110-102 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers Tuesday night at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. 
 
 Monta Ellis  added 18 points and 10 assists as the Bucks (22-18) improved to 6-2 under new coach  Jim Boylan . 
 
 Evan Turner  led Philadelphia (17-25) with 23 points,  Spencer Hawes  had 21 points and 12 rebounds and  Nick Young  scored 20 points, but the Sixers still lost for the 10th time in 13 games. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "That's been something I've been working on -- especially during the road trip -- trying to take over games and get the best possible shot for the team. That's just me growing and learning and Jim (Boylan) giving me the ball down the stretch." 
 
 -- Jennings, who scored or assisted on 14 of 16 Bucks points during a key stretch of the fourth quarter 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Bucks' starting backcourt of Jennings and Ellis fotaled 43 points, 17 assists and five steals to 17 points, 12 assists one steal for the Sixers' starting guard combo of  Jrue Holiday  and  Royal Ivey . 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Bucks had seen a 14-point lead dwindle down to 85-80 when Jennings drilled a step-back 3-pointer with 7:52 left. Beginning with that shot, Jennings scored seven points and dished out three assists -- including  Mike Dunleavy 's 3-pointer -- to account for 14 of Milwaukee's next 16 points. Jennings completed the run with an assist to Ilyasova, whose jumper made it 101-92 with 2:39 left. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "The way we play on the road, we're a 50-win team. But the way we play at home we're like a 35-win team. That's a little backward, so we've got to get that straightened out with some home wins. Hopefully we can do that." 
 
 -- Dunleavy 
 
 
 HOT:  Ilyasova made 10 of 17 shots and is now 20-for-31 over his last two games. He had 27 points and 14 rebounds Saturday in a 110-104 victory at Portland. 
 
 NOT:  Holiday was just 3-for-12 and also had eight turnovers. He was held to nine points -- well under his average of 19.2 points. He did, however, contribute 12 assists. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Jennings is averaging 27.5 points and 7.5 assists over his last two games.  
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA: Bobby Dandridge , the starting small forward on the Bucks' 1971 NBA Championship team, was in the house and signing autographs before the game and at halftime. Dandridge was a fourth-round pick in 1969, the same draft in which the Bucks took  Lew Alcindor (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar)  with the first overall pick. Dandridge became a starter as a rookie and averaged 18.4 points and eight rebounds in his second season in helping the Bucks to the title in just their third year of existence. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  When Sixers coach  Doug Collins  went small in the fourth quarter, Boylan stayed with Ilyasova and was rewarded as the 6-foot-10 forward had five points and five rebounds in the fourth quarter, including a tip-in of a missed free throw with 39.5 seconds left that iced the game. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Bucks forward  John Henson  scored nine points in 11 ½ minutes and showed some nifty moves under the basket.  
 
 NOTABLE:  Tuesday marked the 45th anniversary of the league's 1968 announcement that Milwaukee would be awarded an NBA franchise. The Bucks began play in the fall of 1968. ... The game was Milwaukee's 3,600th in franchise history. ... Boylan's 6-2 start matches  Mike Dunleavy Sr.  (1992) and  Del Harris  (1987) for the best eight-game starts for a Bucks coach. ...  Larry Sanders  had two blocks to extend his streak to 27 games with at least one blocked shot.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the 76ers, Saturday vs. New York, Monday vs. Memphis, Wednesday vs. Washington. For the Bucks, Friday @ Cleveland, Saturday vs. Golden State, Tuesday @ Detroit.
