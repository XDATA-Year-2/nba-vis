 THE FACTS: James Harden  scored 29 points and added seven assists and four steals, and  Carlos Delfino  made 6-of-7 3-pointers on his way to 22 points off the bench against his old team as the Houston Rockets rallied from an 18-point deficit to whip the Milwaukee Bucks, 115-101, Friday night in Milwaukee. 
 
 Patrick Patterson  and  Toney Douglas  added 18 each off the bench, as the Rockets (19-14) outscored the Bucks, 68-43, in the second half. 
 
 Brandon Jennings  had 16 to lead the Bucks (16-15), who lost their third straight thanks to a season-high 25 turnovers. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Just pathetic. Just a pathetic display of taking care of the ball. It enabled them to get out into the open floor on 1-on-0, 2-on-0 and 3-on-0 breaks and easy, easy baskets. It just really sucked the life out of the team and the building." --  Bucks forward  Mike Dunleavy  on his team's 25 turnovers, 19 of which came in the second half. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Houston has just five points off six Milwaukee turnovers at the half and trailed, 58-47. The Rockets then scored 10 points off 10 third-quarter turnovers and 13 points off nine fourth-quarter turnovers to completely turn the game around. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  For the second time in six days the Bucks were absolutely awful in the third quarter. This time they missed their first 10 shots and committed seven turnovers before finally scoring from the field on  Ekpe Udoh's  tip-in with 5:22 left in the quarter. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "The second quarter we started turning it over and they just got on top of us. It looked like they were going to maul us. Then we battled back. Really, that third quarter is about as good as we could play. We locked down the defensive end, we pushed it up, we got shots, we made shots, we had steals. Tony Douglas was phenomenal in changing the tempo of the game." --  Rockets coach  Kevin McHale.   
 
 
 HOT:  The Rockets had plenty of hot shooters. Delfino made 8 of 11, and  Omer Asik  and Patterson each made 6 of 7.  
 
 NOT:  Rockets forward  Marcus Morris  missed all seven shots he took, and Milwaukee's  Monta Ellis  struggled through a 5-for-19 night. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  When  Jeremy Lin  had to leave to receive five stitches after slamming heads with Milwaukee's  Larry Sanders , just 1:26 into the third quarter, McHale called on Douglas, who scored 12 of his 18 points in the period. Lin returned start the fourth quarter and finished with eight points, seven assists and six turnovers. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Bucks would probably say that going to the locker room at halftime was their worst move of the night. They were never the same once they left the court after the first 24 minutes. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Milwaukee's  John Henson  was a lone highlight, posting 11 points, 15 rebounds, two blocked shots and two steals in 27 minutes.  
 
 NOTABLE:  The Bucks have lost three straight since beating Miami in a rousing home victory Saturday night. ... Sanders had four blocks in the first half, but when he picked up three fouls in the first 2:05 of the third quarter and had to go to the bench. He was never a factor again. ... The Rockets have won three in a row and 10 of their last 13. ... The Bucks are 2-8 against the Western Conference this season.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Rockets, Saturday @ Cleveland, Tuesday vs. Los Angeles Lakers, Wednesday @ New Orleans. For the Bucks, Saturday @ Indiana, Tuesday vs. Phoenix, Wednesday @ Chicago.
