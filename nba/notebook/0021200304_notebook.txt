 THE FACTS :  In a tense second rendition of the Battle of the Boroughs, the Knicks emerged victorious over the Nets 100-97. A 3-pointer from  Jason Kidd  (converted while getting fouled by  Jerry Stackhouse ) with 24 seconds remaining provided the difference.  Carmelo Anthony  poured in a season-high 45 points as the Knicks (16-5) fought back from a 17-point deficit with Anthony and Kidd (18 points) combining to shoot 11-for-15 from long range.  Andray Blatche  led the Nets (11-9) with a season-high 23 points in under 30 minutes, while  Deron Williams  registered 18 points and 10 assists.  
 
 QUOTABLE : "I would say, in a perfect world, they should only make seven or eight 3s tonight, not 14."  
 -- Nets coach  Avery Johnson  
 
 
 THE STAT : The Knicks (14-for-28) scored 30 more points from behind the arc than the Nets (4-for-18). Two of the Nets' 3-point attempts came on the game's final possession. 
 
 TURNING POINT : Kidd's 4-point play chance on his eventual game-winning 3 -- he missed the free throw -- set up opportunities for  Gerald Wallace  (17 points) and then Williams to send the game to overtime, but both players misfired.  
 
 QUOTABLE II : "It's kind of a trigger effect from Carmelo having a big night, which is why we tried to make sure that he didn't get another look."  
 -- Jerry Stackhouse on Kidd's game-winning 3-pointer  
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA :  Michael Rapaport, Spike Lee, Itzhak Perlman, Rosie Perez, Mike D of the Beastie Boys, and Sharon Robinson, the daughter of Jackie Robinson, attended the game. ... The crowd was either passionately pro-Knicks, or the Knicks fans were just louder than the Nets fans.  
 
 ROOKIE WATCH :  Pablo Prigioni  made a minimal statistical impact in nine-plus minutes of action, tallying three rebounds and an assist. 
 
 NOTABLE : Blatche scored 12 of the first 21 Nets points, as the home team jumped out to a 21-5 lead. ... The Nets outscored the Knicks 18-2 in the paint in the first quarter and 48-20 for the game. ... After scoring a career-high 28 in their first encounter, it took  Tyson Chandler  over 20 minutes of action to score his first points, but it was his back-tap that enabled Kidd to drain the winning shot. ...  Reggie Evans  snared a season-high 18 rebounds. ...  MarShon Brooks  (9 points) had his second consecutive efficient game off the Nets' bench. ...  Steve Novak  took 1 shot in 21 minutes of action. ... Kidd added 6 assists without a turnover to round out his virtuoso offensive performance.   
 
 UP NEXT : For the Knicks, Thursday vs. LA Lakers, Saturday vs. Cleveland, Monday vs. Houston. For the Nets, Wednesday @ Toronto, Friday vs. Detroit, Saturday @ Chicago.
