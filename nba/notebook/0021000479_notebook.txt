  Nets-Bulls notebook   By Kent McDill, for NBA.com Posted Friday December 31, 2010 6:24PM THE FACTS:  It took a long time, but the host Bulls (21-10) finally put away the visiting New Jersey Nets 90-81 in a New Year's Eve afternoon affair at the United Center. Bulls forward  Carlos Boozer  scored 20 points and had 15 rebounds to lead all players in both categories. The Nets (9-24) were within two points with less than seven minutes to go before the Bulls pulled away. New Jersey center  Brook Lopez  had 19 points for the Nets. THE FACTS II:  The Bulls are 12-2 in their last 14 games. They are 5-2 since losing center  Joakim Noah  to injury. The Nets played without two key bench players,  Jordan Farmar  (right knee injury) and  Troy Murphy  (viral infection). QUOTABLE:  "I thought we had a phenomenal December. Hopefully we can carry that into 2011 and have a good January."    -- Bulls forward Carlos Boozer. THE STAT:  Neither team managed to shoot 40 percent from the field. The Nets were 30-for-77 (39.0 percent) and the Bulls were 30-for-76 (39.5 percent). TURNING POINT:  Leading 75-73 with six minutes remaining, the Bulls passed the ball around the perimeter until  Kyle Korver  faked a jumper, dribbled past his defender and passed the ball to Boozer inside for a three-point play. Three minutes later, Korver did it again, getting the defender to bite on his head fake, dribbling once toward the hoop before finding Boozer again for a dunk and an 86-77 Bulls lead with 2:52 left. HOT:  Boozer extended his 20-point scoring streak to five games with 20 points on 8-for-14 shooting. In his last five games Boozer has averaged 26.2 points and just under 13 rebounds. NOT:  Bulls guard  Derrick Rose  was 5-for-16 from the field but finished with 19 points and nine assists. QUOTABLE II:  "For us to win,  Devin  [ Harris ] has to score. It would have been nice if he could have gotten 20 out there tonight."    -- New Jersey Nets coach  Avery Johnson . GOOD MOVE:  In need of help because of a short bench, Johnson used 7-foot center  Johan Petro  for more than 12 minutes Friday and Petro provided six rebounds and four points spelling starter Lopez. NOTABLE:  Noah, the Bulls' injured starting center, got a start on what might be a terrific second career when he spent the third quarter broadcasting the game with the Bulls' TV crew of  Neal Funk  and  Bill Wennington . UP NEXT:  For Bulls, vs. Cleveland Saturday, vs. Toronto Tuesday, at New Jersey Wednesday. For Nets, at Minnesota Saturday, vs. Chicago Wednesday, at Washington Friday.
