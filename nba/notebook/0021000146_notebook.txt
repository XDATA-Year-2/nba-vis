  Hornets-Mavericks notebook   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Tuesday November 16, 2010 12:25AM THE FACTS:  Clutch fourth-quarter shooting from the Mavericks' version of the Big Three handed the Hornets their first loss of the season Monday in Dallas.  Jason Terry, Jason Kidd  and  Dirk Nowitzki  combined for 27 of the Mavs' 29 points in the final period, erasing a 10-point deficit and extending Dallas' winning streak to four games. The Hornets, who got off to a franchise-best 8-0 start, get another crack at the Mavericks on Wednesday in New Orleans. QUOTABLE:  "It was really intense with the Hornets coming in 8-0. ... For three minutes at the end of the game, we just said 'Who wants it more?' and we were that team tonight."   -- Terry THE STAT:  After a 5-for-14 effort from the field through three quarters, Terry was 4-for-5 in the fourth. His turnaround 18-footer with 34.9 seconds left held up as the game winner. TURNING POINT:  Trailing 87-77 with seven minutes left, Kidd connected on back-to-back 3-pointers to spark a game-ending 21-8 run by the Mavericks. HOT:  Kidd (3-for-3), Terry (2-for-2) and Nowitzki (1-for-1) made all six of their 3-point attempts during the decisive fourth quarter. Terry finished with 26 points off the bench. Nowitzki had 25 points and 10 rebounds and Kidd contributed 16 points, eight boards and six assists. NOT:  The Hornets shot 30.4 percent (7-for-23) in the final quarter and made only three of their last 15 shots. Starters  Chris Paul, Emeka Okafor, David West  and  Trevor Ariza  were a combined 1-for-13 in the fourth. New Orleans has dropped four straight in Dallas and 14 of its last 15. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  For the Hornets, Okafor matched a season-high with 14 rebounds and blocked three shots and  Peja Stojakovic  scored a season-high 17 points (4-for-6 3-pointers). Paul had 22 points, nine assists and three steals. NOTABLE:  The protective boot has been removed from the left foot of second-year Mavericks guard  Rodrigue Beaubois , a positive sign that he is getting closer to a return. He broke the foot in August and underwent surgery. There's no definitive timetable, but 2-3 weeks is a conservative estimate. UP NEXT:  For the Hornets, Wednesday vs. Dallas, Friday vs. Cleveland, Sunday @ Sacramento. For the Mavericks, Wednesday @ New Orleans, Friday vs. Chicago, Saturday @ Atlanta.
