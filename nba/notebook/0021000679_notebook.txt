  Rockets-Mavericks notebook   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Thursday January 27, 2011 11:42PM THE FACTS:   Tyson Chandler  and  Jason Kidd  posted double-doubles and five other Mavericks scored in double figures Thursday as they held off the relentless Rockets and improved to 20-1 this season when scoring at least 100 points with a 111-106 victory in Dallas. Chandler had 21 points and 15 rebounds and Kidd added 11 points and 10 assists as the Mavericks won their third straight. Houston, which overcame a 25-point deficit to make Dallas sweat, got 30 points from  Luis Scola , 27 from Kevin Martin and a career high-tying 16 from  Chuck Hayes . QUOTABLE:  "There is no time for us not to be mentally engaged. I don't know what the reason was. It was everybody. I put the second group in and it didn't get any better. I don't know why it took a while for us to wake up."   -- Houston head coach  Rick Adelman  on the Rockets' 10 first-half turnovers. THE STAT:  For the first time this season, the Mavericks scored 30 or more points in back-to-back quarters: the first (33) and second (31). Their season-high 64 first-half points eclipsed the previous mark of 57 set in a 117-107 loss to Orlando on Jan. 8. Dallas shot 54.2 percent in the half, with Chandler (14 points) and  Dirk Nowitzki  (13) leading the charge. TURNING POINT:  Houston hacked a massive Mavericks lead down to two with a 26-6 run in the third quarter, only to fall behind by 11 in the fourth. The Rockets used a 12-2 spurt to pull within 104-103, but  J.J. Barea  knocked down a 13-foot jumper and Jason Terry converted four clutch free throws down the stretch. QUOTABLE II:  "They were setting a lot of picks for him. ... He was getting like two or three picks at a time and you try to stay home on Nowitzki and you try to help out on Terry and Kidd and he made us pay."   -- Rick Adelman on J.J. Barea's late jumper. HOT:  Chandler has now scored in double figures in nine of his last 12 games, after doing so just 11 times in his previous 30 contests this season. He was 11-for-12 at the foul line against the Rockets and matched his season high for points set Tuesday against the Clippers. The Mavericks are 6-0 when he scores at least 15 points. ... Scola was 14-for-21 from the field and Martin, who leads the league in free throws made, was 11-for-12 at the line. NOT:  The Mavericks led by as many as 21 points in the first quarter as the Rockets struggled, shooting 28.6 percent (6-for-21) in the period. Dallas scored 10 points in the quarter off five Houston turnovers and posted a 13-0 advantage in fastbreak points. ... Rockets guards  Kyle Lowry  and  Aaron Brooks  both shot 2-for-10 from the field. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  After shooting a dreadful 12.9 percent from 3-point range in November and 15.4 percent in December, Barea is lighting it up from behind the arc in January. Through 14 games this month, he is shooting 54.8 percent (17-for-30) from long distance. Barea scored 19 points on 8-for-10 shooting against the Rockets. ROOKIE WATCH:  Houston forward  Patrick Patterson  contributed six points and four rebounds in 16-plus minutes of the bench. He was 3-for-4 from the field, including a one-handed putback slam early in the fourth quarter. NOTABLE:  Despite missing almost the entire season, injured Rockets center  Yao Ming  was voted as the starting center for the Western Conference All-Star squad. Commissioner  David Stern  will pick his replacement for the All-Star Game in Los Angeles on Feb. 20. ... The Mavericks' bench outscored the Houston reserves by a 48-14 margin. In the last five games, Dallas has averaged 44.8 bench points. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Saturday vs. Atlanta, Monday vs. Washington, Wednesday @ New York. For the Rockets, Saturday @ San Antonio, Tuesday @ Los Angeles Lakers, Wednesday @ Utah.
