  Notebook: Mavs 116, Jazz 101   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Friday January 27, 2012 11:47PM THE FACTS:  Missing three starters due to injuries Friday, Dallas used a deep bench and deep shots to deep-six the visiting Utah Jazz 116-101. Six Mavericks scored in double figures, led by a season-high 22 points from  Rodrigue Beaubois , a season-high 19 from  Lamar Odom  and 18 off the bench from  Jason Terry . Dallas drained a season-high 11 3-pointers and notched its sixth straight win against the Jazz, who got 20 points from  Paul Millsap  and 19 from  Al Jefferson . Already playing without  Dirk Nowitzki  and  Delonte West , the Mavericks lost  Jason Kidd  just 2:13 into the game with a strained right calf. Everyone pitched in to fill the void, as  Shawn Marion  scored 16,  Vince Carter  added 12 points and  Brendan Haywood  posted his first double-double of the season with 12 points and a game-high 12 rebounds. QUOTABLE:  "The Jazz are a great team, but my teammates pushed me. Everybody was pitching in, so yeah, I've had some good games against the Jazz because of my teammates."   --Rodrigue Beaubois, whose previous season high came at Utah on Jan. 19 with 17 points in 18 minutes off the bench. THE STAT:  Coming off a 6-for-22 effort from downtown in Wednesday's loss to Minnesota, Dallas shot 58 percent from 3-point range (11-for-19). That topped the previous high of 10 treys set in a victory over Milwaukee on Jan. 13. Odom was 3-for-4 and Beaubois and Terry were both 3-for-5. TURNING POINT:  After the Jazz narrowed the gap to 82-80 with a 17-5 run that included 11 points by Millsap, the Mavericks answered with a decisive 28-9 run. The spurt featured two 3-pointers by Odom, a 3-pointer and a three-point play from Beaubois, and 3-pointers by Marion and Terry. Utah shot just 35 percent (7-for-20) in the final quarter. QUOTABLE II : "He was in the paint a lot. He broke us down a little bit and he made some shots early. He was able to get his teammates involved by collapsing the defense and kicking it out to the 3-point shooters. He did a really good job for them."   -- Jazz head coach  Tyrone Corbin  on Beaubois. GOOD MOVE:  Giving Beaubois his first start of the season (43rd career) to replace the injured West worked out pretty well for the Mavericks. He scored 16 in the first half alone. Beaubois also set career highs in assists (seven) and blocked shots (four) and tied his season high with six rebounds. The 6-foot-2 guard has seven blocks in his last two games. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Odom followed up his worst outing of the season with his best. Benched in the third quarter after going 2-for-14 from the field against the Timberwolves, the reigning NBA Sixth Man of the Year finished 7-for-12 in this one with five rebounds. His previous high was 16 points at New Orleans on Jan. 21. ... Haywood is averaging 9.0 points and 9.5 boards in his last four games. INSIDE THE ARENA:  The Oak Ridge Boys sang the national anthem. ROOKIE WATCH:  Jazz center  Enes Kanter  didn't check into the game until the 5:09 mark of the third period, but finished with a season-best 12 points in 12-plus minutes on 5-for-8 shooting. His seven boards matched Millsap for the team lead. NOTABLE:  Kidd is day-to-day, while West (right hamstring strain) said he hopes to return to the lineup Sunday along with Nowitzki (sore right knee). ... This was the second time Dallas has had six double-digit scorers (vs. the Hornets on Jan. 7). ... It was the highest-scoring game for Beaubois since a 40-point game at Golden State on March 27, 2010. ... Carter had missed the previous five games with a sprained left foot. ... The Mavericks' previous season high was 102 points (two times). UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Sunday vs. San Antonio, Monday @ Phoenix, Wednesday vs. Oklahoma City. For the Jazz, Saturday vs. Sacramento, Monday vs. Portland, Wednesday vs. Los Angeles Clippers.
