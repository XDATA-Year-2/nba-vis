  Notebook: Grizzlies 113, Rockets 93   By L. Jason Smith, for NBA.com Posted Friday December 30, 2011 11:40PM THE FACTS:  Memphis Grizzlies forward  Zach Randolph  scored 23 points and center  Marc Gasol  added 20 points and a career-high-tying five blocks to lift Memphis to a 113-93 victory over the Houston Rockets on Friday at FedExForum. Six Grizzlies (1-2) finished in double figures, including point guard  Jeremy Pargo , who had 14 points and five assists starting in place of injured point guard  Mike Conley .  Kevin Martin 's 21 points led the Rockets (1-2), who were outscored 31-16 in the third quarter. QUOTABLE:  "That's the best defense I've seen Zach play since he's been here."    -- Grizzlies coach  Lionel Hollins  on Randolph, who helped limit Rockets forward  Luis Scola  and reserve center  Samuel Dalembert  to a combined eight points and six rebounds. Memphis outscored the Rockets 56-36 in the paint. THE STAT:  Memphis eclipsed the 100-point mark for the first time this season Friday despite not making a single 3-pointer. The Grizzlies were 0-of-5 from 3-point range against Houston, lowering their percentage from long range this season to 17.9 (5-for-28). "We don't have any 3-point shooters," Hollins said. "It's just as simple as that." TURNING POINT:  The Grizzlies led 57-51 at halftime before blowing the game open in the third quarter on the perfect shooting of Gasol, Pargo and reserve guard  Quincy Pondexter , who combined to go 8-for-8 from the field for 21 of Memphis' 31 third-quarter points. Houston, meanwhile, shot 30 percent (6-for-20) in the quarter, and trailed 88-67 after three. QUOTABLE II:  "Any time you have Randolph and Gasol go 17-of-22, you are going to have major issues."   -- Houston coach  Kevin McHale  on Memphis' inside duo. HOT:  Randolph finished 11-for-14 from the field, helping Memphis shoot 56.3 percent for the game. Gasol was highly efficient as well, making 6-for-8 shot attempts and 8-of-9 free throws. NOT:  Just one Rockets player ( Chase Budinger ) scored more than two points in a third quarter in which Houston made just six field goals. Budinger scored seven of the Rockets' 16 points in the quarter on 3-for-6 shooting. The rest of the team went 3-for-14. NOTABLE:  Houston was playing the second of three games in three days. The Rockets beat San Antonio at home Thursday 105-85, and will host Atlanta on Saturday. Prior to their loss to Memphis on Friday, Houston had won eight of their last nine against the Grizzlies. ... With Conley out (left ankle sprain), Memphis continued to get good production from its rookie point guards. With Pargo in early foul trouble, rookie  Josh Selby , who played at Kansas, played 26 minutes, registering nine points and a team-high seven assists. UP NEXT:  For the Grizzlies, Sunday @ Chicago, Tuesday vs. Sacramento, Wednesday @Minnesota. For the Rockets, Saturday vs. Atlanta, Tuesday @ Lakers, Wednesday @ Clippers.
