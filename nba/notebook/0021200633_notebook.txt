 THE FACTS:   Kyle Korver  scored a season-high 27 points Friday on a career-high eight 3-pointers as the Hawks rallied from a disastrous start for a 123-111 double-overtime win over the visiting Celtics. 
 Boston led by 27 points in the second quarter, but the Celtics suffered their sixth straight loss after Atlanta overcame the biggest halftime deficit (19 points, 57-38) for a home win in franchise history. The Celts led 29-10 after one quarter. 
 All of Korver's treys came in the second half, a franchise record, as Atlanta flipped the script of three weeks ago. The Hawks (25-18) led Boston 53-38 at halftime on Jan. 5 in Philips Arena only to lose as the Celtics (20-23) outscored them 33-9 in the third quarter to win 89-81. 
 Atlanta's  Jeff Teague  scored 23 points and  Al Horford  (24 points, 13 rebounds) and  Josh Smith  (17, 14) added double-doubles for the Hawks, who have won three straight after losing eight of 10. 
 
 Rajon Rondo  had a triple-double (16 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds) for the second straight night for Boston, and  Kevin Garnett  had 24 points and 10 rebounds before fouling out in the second overtime.  
 The Hawks trailed 94-84 with 4:44 left in regulation before putting together a 14-4 run as Korver took 3-pointers on four straight Atlanta possessions and made three.  
 
 QUOTABLE:   "It was a good one; that's for sure. We had a good example of how to come back from what they did to us last time. . . . When the ones that don't feel good still go in, it's nice." --  Korver. 
 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "This is probably, I'm trying to think as a coach and as a player, one of the most amazing comebacks I've been associated with. I told the guys at halftime I wasn't going to . . . rant and rave or throw out numbers from the stat sheet because I thought it was more than that. I wanted my guys to have fun, and be smiling, and be chest bumping, and high-fiving and that's what I told them." --  Hawks coach  Larry Drew. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  20-4: The Hawks combined to outscore the Celtics 20-4 in the paint in the critical third quarter (12-2) and second overtime (8-2). Atlanta also outscored Boston 17-0 in third quarter fast-break points. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Hawks started the second half on a 21-2 run to tie the game. In that 5:44, the Celtics missed six straight shots, they had five turnovers (Teague had three steals and  Devin Harris  one) and they were out-rebounded 7-2.  
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "We play well in stretches, but then we start breaking rules that you shouldn't break in middle school. It was a joke . . . We get a big lead, and we start thinking we're the 2008 [NBA championship] team. We're not, and we haven't earned that right." --  Celtics coach  Doc Rivers. 
 
 
 HOT:  Korver was 3-for-5 on 3-pointers in the third quarter, and 5-for-6 in the fourth for 15 points. He was scoreless in the overtimes after scoring 24 in the second half. He has made at least one trey in 37 straight games, the longest active streak in the NBA and five short of the franchise record ( Mookie Blaylock , 42). . . . Teague was 5-for-5 in the second quarter for 14 points.  
 
 NOT:  In the first quarter, the Hawks missed 18 of their final 20 shots and were 4-for-23 overall. . . . Boston's Paul Pierce scored 12 points in 40 minutes on 4-for-13 shooting. He had five turnovers, and missed all five of his trey tries. Josh Smith blocked his potential game-winning jumper in the lane at the end of the first overtime. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Drew started the second half smaller by subbing out starting center  Ivan Johnson , moving Horford there from power forward, moving Smith to power forward, Korver from shooting guard to small forward and putting sub Harris in at shooting guard. Atlanta went on a 21-2 run. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Celtics made all 20 of their free throws, but did not go to the line in the second overtime. . . . Horford shot 10-for-11 from the free throw line to tie his career high for freebies made in a game. . . . Korver's previous career high was seven 3-pointers made Nov. 11, 2004 against the Pacers when he played for the 76ers. . . . Atlanta reserve center  Zaza Pachulia  (sore right Achilles' tendon) did not play for the second straight game.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Celtics, Sunday vs. Miami, Wednesday vs. Sacramento, Friday vs. Orlando. For the Hawks, Sunday @ New York, Wednesday vs. Toronto, Saturday vs. Chicago.
