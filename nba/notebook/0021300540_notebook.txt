 THE FACT:  Before tonight, the Sacramento Kings (12-22) had allowed their last 10 opponents to score 100 points or more, giving up an average of 112.5 points per game in that span. Tonight, they held the Orlando Magic (10-26) to just 83 points.   
 
 THE LEAD:  Despite an atrocious shooting night by Sacramento's starting backcourt, the Kings sent the Orlando Magic to their sixth loss in a row tonight at Sleep Train Arena, by the final of 103-83. 
 
 DeMarcus Cousins  recorded his ninth straight double-double, finishing with a game-high 24 points and 14 rebounds in the win.  Rudy Gay  kicked in 22 points on 8-of-13 shooting and added five assists and 10 rebounds.  Jason Thompson  and  Derrick Williams  each went for 14 and  Jimmer Fredette  scored eight of his 11 points in a one minute spurt during the second quarter. 
 Playing without center  Nikola Vucevic , the Magic turned to  Glen Davis  to slow down Cousins. Davis held his own during the first half, but Cousins was too much to contain all night long.   
 
 Tobias Harris  led the way for Orlando, scoring a team-high 16 points on 5-of-10 shooting.  Arron Afflalo  chipped in 15 points, but shot just 3-for-12 from the floor in the loss. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We validated our Portland win.  For one of the few times this year, after beating a good team, we came back and validated it and we built on that win." --  Sacramento Kings coach  Michael Malone 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Kings held the Magic to just 33.3 percent shooting on the night. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Sacramento came out of halftime energized and ran the Magic off the court.   
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It's all a tribute to us moving the ball, playing together and also running and playing Kings basketball."  --  Gay on the win 
 
 
 HOT:  Cousins is playing incredible basketball right now for Sacramento.  He finished the night with 24 points, 14 rebounds, six assists and three steals in 39 minutes. 
 
 NOT:   Jameer Nelson  couldn't buy a bucket tonight in Sacramento, finishing with six points on 2-for-11 shooting. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  With Vucevic missing the game, the Kings fed the post, outscoring the Magic 48-24 on points in the paint.   
 
 NOTABLE:  Cousins recorded his 22nd double-double of the season. The Kings have swept the season series with the Magic for the second straight season. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Magic, Saturday @ Denver, Monday @ Dallas, Wednesday vs. Bulls. For the Kings, Sunday vs. Cleveland, Tuesday @ Indiana, Wednesday @ Minnesota.
