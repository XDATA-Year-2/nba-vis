 THE FACT:   Washington's point total was the lowest Indiana has allowed since an 84-64 victory over Toronto on April 2, 2004. 
 
 THE LEAD:  With their usual suspects suspect, at least offensively, the Pacers had to turn to some different sources for scoring.  David West  scored 20 to lead the team in scoring for the first time this season as Indiana routed Washington 93-66 Friday.  
 
 C.J. Watson  had 16 off the bench to complement another suffocating defensive effort, as Indiana (29-7) improved to 18-1 at home and snapped the Wizards' two-game road winning streak, holding the visitors to 32 percent shooting.  Bradley Beal  lead Washington (16-18) with 17 points, while  John Wall  scored 13 but the two guards combined to shoot 10-for-33. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "You want to see a team come out and play as hard as any team you've ever seen on the defensive end, come out and watch our basketball team. ...They care about that end of the court, they're having fun with it, they're working for each other, working together, covering for each other."  
 -- Indiana coach  Frank Vogel  
 
 
 THE STAT:  The teams combined to shoot 22-for-45 (.489) from the free-throw line. Washington was particularly egregious at 9-for-23 (.391). During one stretch in the second quarter, the teams combined to miss nine in a row. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  After an ugly first half, West scored six points in an 8-0 burst that pushed Indiana's lead to 56-40 midway through the third period. When the Wizards chipped it to 67-57 early in the fourth, Watson stepped in, scoring 11 points, including two 3-pointers and a three-point play, to spark a 24-7 run that put it out of reach. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "You look at David West's numbers and it looks like he's having an OK season. He's someone that could average 20 and 10 if he wanted to but he's leading our team in sacrifice and team play."  
 -- Indiana coach Frank Vogel 
 
 
 HOT:   West shot 9-for-13, while Watson was 6-for-6, including 3-for-3 from the 3-point line. 
 
 NOT: Paul George  shot 2-for-14 and scored eight points, falling short of double figures for the first time this season. George is shooting .347 overall, .209 from the 3-point line in the last seven games.  Danny Granger  shot 1-for-7 for the Pacers, ending his streak of six consecutive double-figure scoring games off the bench. Washington's starting lineup combined to shoot 16-for-55 (.291). 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "It's something I'm going to have to deal with for the next few weeks. I'm just going go try to get through it, make sure to keep it protected."

 NOTABLE:  The Wizards posted the lowest point total in the NBA this season. ... Indiana outrebounded Washington 61-41, posting a season high on the boards in the process. ... Indiana had just one blocked shot. ...  Lance Stephenson  had his eighth double-double with 11 points and 10 rebounds. ... Washington has dropped 12 in a row in Indiana. ...  Roy Hibbert  hit a corner 3-pointer in the second quarter. It was his second of the season and sixth of his career (in 19 attempts). ... Stephenson picked up his sixth technical foul of the season, and Vogel his fourth. ... The Wizards were without  Al Harrington  (right knee surgery) and  Glen Rice  (fractured right wrist). 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Pacers, Tuesday vs. Sacramento, Thursday vs. Knicks, Saturday vs. Clippers. For the Wizards, Saturday vs. Houston, Monday at Chicago, Wednesday vs. Miami.
