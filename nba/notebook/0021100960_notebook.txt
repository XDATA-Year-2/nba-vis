  Notebook: Wizards 101, Bobcats 73 Posted Monday April 23, 2012 11:58PM By Rich Dubroff, for NBA.com    THE FACTS: John Wall  had 16 points and 14 assists,  Jan Vesely  scored a career-high 16 points on 8-for-8 shooting and  Nene  had 16 to lead the Washington Wizards to a 101-73 win over the Charlotte Bobcats. It was the Bobcats' 21st straight loss and Washington's fourth straight win. The Wizards ran off 16 straight points late in the first quarter and in the beginning of the second to take a 37-22 lead. They led by 24 at halftime and held Charlotte to just 11 points in the fourth quarter. The Bobcats (7-57), who were led by  Gerald Henderson 's 19 points and  D.J. Augustin 's 15, must win one of their two final games to avoid the NBA's all-time worst record. QUOTABLE:  "I'm not the key. Who's the door if I'm the key?"   -- Nene on suggestions that he's the key to the Wizards' recent success THE STAT:  The Wizards hadn't won four straight games since Dec. 9-13, 2007. TURNING POINT:  Charlotte's  Tyrus Thomas  elbowed Washington's  James Singleton  late in the first quarter. That began the 16-0 run for the Wizards. "We made contact. A basketball play happened," Thomas said. "He connected. I don't flop. He had me a little woozy for a second," Singleton said. QUOTABLE II:  "I don't want and the thing they shouldn't want is to have the worst record in the history of the game. We're susceptible to that. I keep telling them that, but it's on them."   -- Bobcats coach  Paul Silas  on trying to avoid the NBA's worst record. HOT:  Vesely became the second Washington rookie in history to hit all eight of his field goal attempts. On Jan. 13, 1994,  Mitchell Butler  also hit 8-for-8. NOT:  The Bobcats shot just 34.2 percent. Augustin missed nine of 13 from the field. GOOD MOVE:  In his third game since returning from a foot injury, Nene shot 8-for-11. The Wizards have won all three. BAD MOVE:  The Bobcats continue to flounder. Silas seems resigned to his fate. "It's been very, very hard for me because I've never been through this before .The losing part kind of eats you up. I can't sleep at night, wondering what we can do to change this thing around," Silas said. NOTABLE:  The 73 points allowed by Washington were the fewest since Jan. 11, 2006. IN THE ARENA:  There were 17,355 in attendance for a game between the NBA's two worst teams. UP NEXT:  For the Bobcats: Wednesday @ Orlando, Thursday vs. New York. For the Wizards: Wednesday @ Cleveland, Thursday vs. Miami
