 THE FACTS : The Memphis Grizzlies ended their season-long, five-game home stand with a hardfought 90-78 win over the improving Detroit Pistons Friday night at FedExForum. Forward  Rudy Gay  led the Grizzlies with a game-high 18 points, while  Marc Gasol  and  Mike Conley  each added 17. The Pistons were led by center  Greg Monroe 's 17 points and nine rebounds.  
 
 QUOTABLE : "We've been playing pretty decent all year long at home. It was a long homestand. It's probably time to go back on the road. It's not easy on the road, but I think your juices get flowing and you get stale being at home. We'll see what happens tomorrow night."  
 -- Grizzlies' coach  Lionel Hollins  on the Grizzlies big game at San Antonio Saturday night 
 
 THE STAT : Fortunately for the Grizzlies (12-2), they took a 76-66 lead into the fourth quarter because in the final period, neither team could get going. The Pistons (5-12) went just 3-for-14 in the fourth (21.4 percent), while the Grizzlies weren't much better, making 6-for-21 (28.6 percent). 
 
 TURNING POINT : With the game tied at 57, the Grizzlies went on a 13-3 run to take a 70-60 lead with 2:56 left in the third quarter. Conley led the run scoring nine straight points for the Grizzlies including a pair of 3-pointers. 
 
 HOT : Conley had a strong all-around game, scoring 17 points and dishing out five assists to go along with four rebounds and six steals. 
 
 NOT : With Conley draped all over him for most of the night, Detroit point guard  Brandon Knight  had six of his team's 22 turnovers. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "It was just carelessness and just not valuing the basketball as you should. There wasn't a whole lot of pressure. A lot of them were mishandled passes, over-dribbling and stuff like that."  
 -- Pistons guard Brandon Knight on his six turnovers 
 
 NOTABLE : The Grizzlies were playing without starting guard  Tony Allen , who was out with a right groin strain. Starting in his place was  Wayne Ellington , who had an off night, scoring just three points on 1-for-9 shooting. ... The Grizzlies 12 wins in November are the second-most in franchise history. They won 13 games in March of 2006 and April of 2012. ... The Grizzlies have held their last two opponents under 80 points. They entered the game ranked No. 2 in the NBA, holding opponents to 91.1 points per game. ... The loss drops Detroit to 1-9 on the road this season. They travel to Dallas for a game Saturday night. ... Gasol's 17 points and 11 rebounds gave him his first double-double of the season.
