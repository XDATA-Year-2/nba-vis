 THE FACT:  The Lakers surrendered 137 points against the Nuggets, the most in a regulation game since November 1993. 
 
 THE LEAD:  One player who wouldn't mind seeing the Lakers more often is Nuggets backup center  Timofey Mozgov . The 7-footer scored 20 points Sunday night to lead Denver to the 137-115 win over L.A., the third 20-point game of his career. He matched his career high of 23 earlier this season against the Lakers. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "He's a little bigger and stronger than we are." 
 -- Lakers coach  Mike D'Antoni  on Mozgov 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The loss marked the most points the Lakers have allowed at home in a non-overtime game since allowing 146 on Nov. 6, 1984 against (ironically enough) Denver.  
 
 THE STAT I I :  The L.A. bench came into the game second in the league in scoring (44.1) and the Nuggets third (41.6), but it was Denver that owned a 63-41 edge. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Nuggets started to gain separation from the Lakers with a 9-0 run midway through the third quarter that gave them their biggest lead, 79-67. The cushion was still 10 at the start of the fourth when  Ty Lawson  sank a 3-pointer to spark a 7-0 run and the Lakers were never able to cut the deficit back to single digits. 
 
 HOT:  The Nuggets have won at least 10 games in the last five Januarys and they're off to a 2-0 start this month. Denver shot 12-for-29 from 3-point range and is 21-for-51 in its last two games. The Nuggets improved to 7-2 this season when making at least nine from beyond the arc. 
 
 NOT:  The Lakers gave up 44 points in the fourth quarter en route to giving up the most points they've allowed in 20 years. They shot 3-for-21 from 3-point range, the fewest 3s they've made in a game this season and the lowest percentage they shot.  Shawne Williams  sank a 3 at end of half but missed his other five attempts.  Jodie Meeks  was 0-for-3 from beyond the arc and so was  Wes Johnson. 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Nuggets used the fourth quarter to work on some of their style points.  Nate Robinson , the 5-foot-9 guard for Denver, recorded three slam dunks in the final quarter, including a lob dunk that he so enjoyed he hung on the rim for an extra couple seconds to earn a technical foul. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "They're down with injuries and we knew we had to come out and really stick it to them, really put our foot on the gas pedal." 
 -- Nate Robinson 
 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Lakers center  Robert Sacre  needed five stitches to close a cut on his lower lip but he still finished with 15 points, making all six of his field goal attempts. Because of injuries, the Lakers used their 19th different starting lineup this season and 10th in the last 10 games. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Lakers point guard  Kendall Marshall , in his second game as the starter, had nine points, 17 assists and six rebounds, the first L.A. player to put up those numbers since Magic Johnson in 1991. ... Denver improved to 6-26 in its last 32 road games against the Lakers. ... The 137 points were the most given up by the Lakers at home in a non-OT game since they gave up 146 on Nov. 6, 1984 to the Nuggets.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Lakers, Tuesday @ Dallas, Wednesday @ Houston, Friday @ L.A. Clippers. For the Nuggets, Tuesday vs. Boston, Thursday vs. Oklahoma City, Saturday vs. Orlando.
