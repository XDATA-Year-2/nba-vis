  Lakers-Timberwolves notebook   By Tom Coyer, for NBA.com Posted Friday November 19, 2010 11:06PM THE FACTS:  The L.A. Lakers notched their league high 11th win tonight as they defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 112-95. The Lakers were led by  Matt Barnes  off the bench who shot 100% to finish with 24 points. Kobe was not far behind with 23 in the win. QUOTABLE:  "Lamar was embarrassed because of the last performance (Love had 23 points and 24 rebounds ten days ago). I told him I know why Love made the USA Team, it was so he could play against you every day. So he took that to heart and he went out there with a purpose tonight." --  Phil Jackson  on  Lamar Odom' s defensive performance on  Kevin Love. THE STAT:  Barnes making all seven of his shots including 5/5 from behind the three point line. TURNING POINT:  The turning point came early in the second quarter. Minnesota led 20-21 after the first quarter. But the Lakers took the lead back early in the second quarter on a 14-2 run and stretched that lead to as much as 16 in the quarter. NOT:  Love had his worst night of the season not making a basket in seven attempts and finishing with zero points. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:   Darko Milicic  had a complete game racking very good fantasy stats if you happen to have him on your roster. 23 points, 16 rebounds, 6 blocks and 5 assists is a very good fantasy night. NOTABLE:  L.A. finished their three game road trip 3-0 beating Milwaukee by 11, Detroit by 13 and Minnesota by 17. They currently elad the NBA with 12 wins UP NEXT:  For the Lakers, Sunday vs. Golden State, Tuesday vs. Chicago, Friday @ Chicago. For the Timberwolves Monday @ Oklahoma City, Wednesday vs. San Antonio, Saturday vs. Golden State,
