 THE FACTS:  A sizzling start and a fantastic finish carried the Dallas Mavericks to a 111-96 victory Wednesday against the Orlando Magic at the American Airlines Center. Dallas erupted for a season-high 42 points in the first quarter and put Orlando away with 17 unanswered points in the fourth. 
 Dallas (24-29) won for the fourth time in five games, handing Orlando (15-39) its ninth straight road loss.  Shawn Marion  and  Elton Brand  led six Mavericks in double figures with 17 points each.  Arron Afflalo  scored 21 points,  Maurice Harkless  added 20 and  Nikola Vucevic  tallied 16 points and 13 rebounds for the slumping Magic, who have dropped 15 of 16. 
 
 THE STAT:  The road team had won the previous nine meetings in the series. The Mavericks' last win at home against Orlando was on Dec. 17, 2007.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  Dallas began its 17-0 run with 5:16 left in the fourth quarter, clinging to a 94-90 lead.  Brandan Wright  scored six points during that stretch and Dallas got 3-pointers from Marion,  Vince Carter  and  Mike James . During the Magic's 4:06 scoring drought, they missed seven straight shots (and two free throws) and committed three turnovers. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "You've got to get traction and get stops to be the kind of team we want to be. In the fourth quarter we showed we can do it. Now we've got to bring it to the whole game and be able to sustain it. That's a challenge we're going to keep embracing." 
 -- Mavericks coach  Rick Carlisle 
 
 
 HOT:  The Mavericks scored 42 points in the first, a season high for any quarter. They shot 64 percent (16-for-25), including 3-for-6 from deep, and were 7-for-7 at the line. Their previous high was 40 in the second quarter against Washington on Nov. 14. It was also the most points allowed by the Magic in the first quarter this season. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I know Rick [Carlisle] had been talking about their team jumping out and having a better first quarter, and they did that, so that was a great effort by them." 
 -- Magic coach  Jacque Vaughn 
 
 
 NOT:  The Mavericks managed just 17 points on 23.8 percent shooting (5-for-21) in the second quarter, including a 1-for-6 effort from 3-point distance. It was their lowest-scoring period since netting 16 in the fourth quarter against Memphis on Jan. 12. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  J.J. Redick  shot just 3-for-12, including 1-for-5 from behind the arc, and finished with 10 points, three assists and two rebounds. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Late in the third,  O.J. Mayo  hustled back to block a layup attempt by Redick and then delivered a perfect alley-oop pass in transition to Carter for the dunk. That sparked a 10-3 run that gave the Mavericks an 83-82 lead entering the fourth. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "It's as good a hustle sequence as we've had all year. I thought the timing of it couldn't have been more key in the game." 
 --   Rick Carlisle on Mayo's block 
 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  There was a moment of silence before the game for the late  Jerry Buss , the Los Angeles Lakers owner who passed away Monday. ... It was Military Appreciation Night at the American Airlines Center, featuring an enlistment ceremony for 10 new members of the United States Air Force following the first quarter. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Harkless scored 11 of his 20 points in the third quarter and added eight rebounds.  Andrew Nicholson  had 10 points and seven boards. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Mavericks center  Chris Kaman  (concussion) missed his ninth straight game. He began participating in non-contact drills earlier this week. ... Nelson left late in the fourth after tweaking his left knee on a drive to the basket. ... It was Orlando's 12th straight game with a lower 3-point percentage than its opponent. ... Dallas has blocked more shots than its opponent in eight straight games. ... The Mavs are 15-5 when holding teams under 100 points and 21-8 when shooting better than 45 percent. ... Dallas is 12-2 when playing an opponent on the second night of a back-to-back. ... Dallas is 15-1 at home when leading after three quarters. ... Orlando attempted 19 free throws in the first half and just three in the second half. ... Carter (21,810) needs four points to move past Gary Payton (21,813) for 28th place in NBA history.
