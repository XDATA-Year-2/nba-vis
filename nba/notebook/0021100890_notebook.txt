  Notebook: Thunder 115, Timberwolves 110 Posted Saturday April 14, 2012 11:37PM By Jim Beilby, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  No Love for the Wolves and a big night for  Kevin Durant  led to a victory on Saturday night for the Oklahoma City Thunder, as they defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves, 115-110. Kevin Love missed the game after suffering a mild concussion on Wednesday in Denver and Durant scored 43 points for the Thunder. Despite the differences in their records, each of the contests between these teams this year has been very close and hard-fought, and tonight was no exception. On December 26, the Thunder held off Minnesota for a 104-100 win and on March 26, Oklahoma City outlasted the Wolves in a 149-140, double-overtime thriller. In the double-overtime game, Minnesota had no answer for the Durant/ Russell Westbrook  combo as they combined for 85 points. Tonight it was a similar story as Durant and Westbrook together scored 78. While  J.J. Barea  led Minnesota with 24 points and 10 assists, it was Minnesota's bench that kept them in this game, as they out-scored the Thunders' bench 54-18.  Michael Beasley  and  Anthony Randolph  led Minnesota's bench with 26 and 22 respectively. Randolph has filled in admirably in Love's absence, averaging 22.0 ppg on 18-for-28 shooting (.643) in the last two games. QUOTABLE:  "Every game (against Minnesota) is close. It's an overtime game or a last-two minute game. They play with a lot of confidence against us. Give them credit. They shot the ball well."   -- Oklahoma City coach  Scott Brooks THE STAT:  Despite being 26th in the league in field goal percentage, Minnesota outshot Oklahoma City, the No. 2 team in the league, 50 percent to 44 percent. Where Oklahoma City made the difference was in rebounding, outrebounding Minnesota 61-48, and free throw percentage, making 28-of-32 free throws. TURNING POINT:  After Minnesota closed the score to 99-97 with 5:40 to play, Oklahoma City went on a 10-2 run, keyed by eight points from Durant and a pair by Westbrook. Minnesota tried to make it interesting, but the Thunder hit their free throws down the stretch to seal the victory QUOTABLE II:  "You've got to give our guys a lot of credit. We played with a lot of energy tonight. That's a great team with two great players, and we competed the whole time."   -- Minnesota coach  Rick Adelman NOTABLE:  With the loss tonight, Minnesota's losing streak now stands at nine, a season high. And they have lost 12 straight to Oklahoma City. UP NEXT:  For the Wolves, Monday @ Indiana, Tuesday vs. Memphis, Thursday @ Detroit. For the Thunder, Monday @ Clippers, Wednesday @ Phoenix, Friday @ Sacramento.
