  Notebook: Magic 102, Heat 89 Posted Wednesday February 8, 2012 11:18PM By Dick Scanlon, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  The Orlando Magic tacked 17 3-point field goals onto  Dwight Howard 's 25 points and 24 rebounds in a 102-89 victory over the Miami Heat. Dwyane Wade  scored a game-high 33 points for the Heat, who never led in the first game of a six-gme road trip.  LeBron James , who dropped 51 on the Magic in his last trip to Orlando a year ago, had 17 points, six rebounds and 10 assists. The Magic's  Ryan Anderson  scored 24 of his 27 points in the first half and added 11 rebounds. QUOTABLE:  "Obviously the amount of 3s they were able to take and make really made the difference in the game."   -- Miami coach  Erik Spoelstra THE STAT:  Seven Magic shooters combined for 17 3-pointers on a franchise-record 42 attempts. QUOTABLE II:  "That's quite a few, even for us, but I would say 35 or 36 of them were good shots."   -- Magic coach  Stan Van Gundy TURNING POINT:  The Heat had trimmed a 19-point Magic lead to 10 in three minutes when  J.J. Redick  nailed a 3-pointer with 6:16 remaining. HOT:  Anderson made his first five 3-pointers and scored 24 points in the first half. NOT:  Magic forward  Hedo Turkoglu  has scored three points on 1-for-12 shooting in the last two games. GOOD MOVE:  Howard played the entire second half for the Magic. BAD MOVE:  Spoelstra may have waited too long to put James back in the game in the fourth quarter. When James got in with 8:57 left, the Heat were down by 19. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Anderson had 11 more rebounds and has 62 in his last six games. QUOTABLE III:  "Guys are kind of focused on me out on the perimeter so it gives me an opportunity to kind of sneak behind defenses. And when you play with Dwight, a lot of defenses are sucked on him and it gives me a chance to get my hands on the ball."   -- Magic forward Ryan Anderson ROOKIE WATCH: Norris Cole  got his first start for the Heat in place of injured point guard  Mario Chalmers , putting up nine points and four assists in 31 minutes. NOTABLE:  Chalmers bruised his left hand against Cleveland on Tuesday night and missed his first game of the season. ... Wade scored 12 points in a span of 2:44 late in the first half. ... The Magic have won 17 of their last 22 games against the Heat, but still trail the all-time series, 45-43. UP NEXT:  For the Heat, Friday @ Washington, Sunday @ Atlanta, Monday @ Milwaukee. For the Magic, Friday vs. Atlanta, Saturday @ Milwaukee, Monday vs. Minnesota.
