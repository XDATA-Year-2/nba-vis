  Raptors-Hawks notebook   By Matt Winkeljohn, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday February 2, 2011 10:49PM THE FACTS:  The Raptors lost for the 13th straight time as Atlanta's  Joe Johnson  scored a season-high 37 points Wednesday night in the Hawks' 100-87 home win.  Josh Smith  (18 points, 11 rebounds) and  Al Horford  (12, 14) added double-doubles, and Atlanta shot 55.3 percent (42 of 76) and made 10 of 24 3-pointers (41.7 percent).  Amir Johnson  was Toronto's bright spot with 20 points and 14 rebounds.  DeMar DeRozan  scored 16, but all Raptors other than Johnson and DeRozan were 18 of 50 (36 percent percent) from the field. QUOTABLE:  "It was fun out there tonight. We pretty much dictated how we wanted the game to be played."    -- Joe Johnson, who made 15 of 21 shots, including 5 of 8 3-point shots THE STAT:  The Hawks are 11-2 when Joe Johnson has seven or more assists. He had eight Wednesday night. TURNING POINT:  Toronto opened the second half facing a nine-point deficit, and rode a 10-0 blitz to a 55-54 lead only to watch it disintegrate over the next 4:21 as Atlanta made six of its next nine shots. The Raptors missed five of seven shots in that sequence, and turned the ball over twice leaving Atlanta with a 69-59 lead. QUOTABLE II:  "We were right there until the fourth quarter, but we had no answer for Joe Johnson. They were really good at finding the open guy tonight. The game is 48 minutes, but we only played three quarters."    -- Toronto's  Andrea Bargnani HOT:  Hawks small forward  Maurice Evans , who started in place of the suspended  Marvin Willliams , scored 12 points (one below his season high) and made 5 of 7 shots. He's made 10 of 16 shots over the past four games, including half his six 3-point tries ... Smith has made 23 of 37 shots over the past three games. NOT:  Atlanta's  Mike Bibby  scored six points Wednesday, and has totaled 14 over the past three games on 5 of 17 shooting (2 of 9 against Toronto) ...  Jamal Crawford  attempted a modest three 3-point shots Wednesday, making one. That leaves him 3 for 16 over the past three games ... After making just 4 of 12 shots Wednesday, Bargnani has made 8 of 51 shots over his past three games (15.7 percent), and 21 of 74 over the past four (28.4 percent). He's averaging 13 points over the past three games, well below his season average of 20.9. That still leads the Raptors. ROOKIE WATCH:  Toronto forward  Ed Davis  cooled a bit Wednesday night. He had three points, three rebounds, and two assists after back-to-back games of 15 points and 11 rebounds against the Wolves and 13 and seven against the Pacers. NOTABLE:  Williams missed his second straight game to complete this NBA-mandated two-game suspension for throwing punches at the Knicks'  Shawne Williams  last Friday. Marvin Williams is expected to return to the starting lineup Friday when the Clippers visit Atlanta. UP NEXT:  For the Raptors, Friday vs. Wolves, Tuesday @ Bucks, Wednesday vs. Spurs. For the Hawks, Friday vs. Clippers, Saturday @ Wizards, Tuesday vs. 76ers.
