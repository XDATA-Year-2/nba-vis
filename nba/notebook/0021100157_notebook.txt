  Notebook: Cavaliers 101, Suns 90   By Jonathan Dalton, for NBA.com Posted Friday January 13, 2012 12:31AM THE FACTS:  Rookie  Kyrie Irving  scored a career-high 26 points and added six assists to lift the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 101-90 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Thursday night. Antawn Jamison  had 23 points and  Daniel Gibson  added 10 for the Cavaliers, who snapped a two-game losing streak despite shooting only 43.8 percent from the floor and having just the three players in double digits.  Anderson Varejao  added a season-high 17 rebounds for Cleveland. Steve Nash  had 16 points and 15 assists,  Marcin Gortat  scored 14 and  Markieff Morris  added 13 for the Suns, who have dropped two straight. The Suns were without forward  Grant Hill  for most of the game. He first left barely two minutes in when he was cut on the face in a collision Varejao, returned to play another six minutes and then left for good with soreness in his right quadriceps tendon. Phoenix pulled within 80-75 on  Hakim Warrick's  two free throws with 10:48 left but the Cavs, led by  Alonzo Gee's  four points, went on a 9-1 run over the next four-plus minutes to open a 89-76 lead with 6:29 to play. QUOTABLE:  "It was definitely fun playing against such a great point guard. I have been watching him for so long, so to finally get to play against him it was a little surreal."   --  Irving on facing Nash, who was four months from entering Santa Clara when the rookie was born. THE STAT:  Irving recorded one his best shooting nights as a pro, connecting on 11-of-17 field-goal attempts including 2-of-4 3-pointers. TURNING POINT:  Morris sank a 3-pointer to give Phoenix a 40-32 lead with 8:46 left in the first half but then the wheels came off. Led by Irving's 10 straight points, the Cavaliers closed the half on a 24-8 run to take a 56-48 lead and never looked back. At one point during that stretch the Suns missed 11 of 12 field-goal attempts. QUOTABLE II:  "When you look back at the year, you're going to look back at this game and probably say that it was a bad loss at home to a team that you expect to beat, that you should expect to beat."   --  Suns guard  Jared Dudley . HOT:  The Cavaliers already have two road wins against Western Conference opponents after recording only one last season. Cleveland also has three road wins, nearly halfway to last year's total of seven ... Jamison has averaged 22.5 points in his last two games. NOT:  Suns center  Robin Lopez  continued fading deeper into the Phoenix bench, logging only 5:16 of playing time and attempting one field goal. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Suns guard  Michael Redd  settled into the right corner like he'd never been gone, connecting on his first two 3-pointers and 4-of-9 overall for 12 points in his Suns debut. It was his best scoring night since scoring 24 on January 8, 2010 for Milwaukee in Chicago. ROOKIE WATCH:  Morris was better than his 0-for-4, 16-minute performance against the Lakers on Tuesday but still was inconsistent. He hit 5-of-9 attempts from the field but struggled defensively and was finished with five fouls. NOTABLE:  The Cavaliers' 30 first-quarter points were the most scored against the Suns in a period this season ... With a fourth-quarter free throw, Nash became the 15th active player to reach the 16,000-point mark. Teammate Hill is among the other 14. UP NEXT:  For the Cavaliers, Friday at L.A. Lakers, Monday at Charlotte, Tuesday vs. Golden State. For the Suns, Friday vs. New Jersey, Sunday at San Antonio, Tuesday at Chicago.
