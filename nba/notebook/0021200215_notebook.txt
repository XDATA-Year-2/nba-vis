 THE FACTS :  Carmelo Anthony  scored 29 points and didn't even have to play in the fourth quarter as the New York Knicks rolled to a 102-88 victory against the Milwaukee Bucks Wednesday night at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. 
 Anthony was 9-for-18 from the floor and  8-for-9 on free throws, as he had his way with every defender the Bucks threw at him.  Steve Novak  added 19 points for the Knicks (10-4) while playing in his home college arena from his days at Marquette University. 
 For the second straight game, the Milwaukee starters put on a flat performance. This time the bench couldn't bail them out. The Bucks (7-6) lost for the fourth time in five games and fell to 3-4 at home. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "I do know these rims well. I've shot a few shots on these." 
 -- Steve Novak, who went 7-for-10 including 5-for-7 on 3-pointers in his home college arena 
 
 THE STAT : The Knicks didn't outshoot the Bucks by much, only had a 38-36 edge on the boards, had fewer assists, and didn't force many more turnovers than they committed. But New York did make 11 of 21 3-pointers to just 5 of 13 for Milwaukee. That 18-point difference was more than the margin of victory. 
 
 TURNING POINT : Anthony made a 3-pointer with 2:29 left in the half to start a 9-0 run that pushed a 45-44 lead up to 54-44. It was 58-48 at the half, and the Knicks scored the first 10 points of the third quarter to turn the game into a rout. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "I was just taking what they were giving me. If they put a bigger guy on me with  [Larry] Sanders , I was just trying to get to the hole. When they put  Marquis Daniels  on me, I was just trying to get into the paint and be aggressive. Tonight was one of those nights I made shots and I tried to make the game easier for myself." 
 -- Carmelo Anthony 
 
 HOT : Knicks center  Tyson Chandler  went 4-for-4 from the floor and 9-for-10 from the line. He's now 61-for-85 (71.8 percent) and leading the league again in field goal percentage. 
 
 NOT : The Bucks' starting front court of  Tobias Harris , rookie  John Henson  and  Samuel Dalembert  went just 1-for-8 to combine for two points. Not surprisingly, Dalembert and Harris did not see any action in the second half. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA : Milwaukee Brewers legend and Hall-of-Famer Robin Yount was in courtside seats, as were Brewers general manager Doug Melvin and Green Bay Packers players Charles Woodson and James Jones. Yount, Woodson and Jones were shown on the video screen and drew bigger cheers than the Bucks. 
 
 GOOD MOVE : Knicks coach  Mike Woodson  gave season-high minutes to Novak and  Pablo Prigioni , and the two combined to go 11-for-16, including 7-for-9 on 3-pointers. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH : Bucks second-round pick  Doron Lamb  played a season-high 24 minutes and chipped in eight points, including the first two 3-pointers of his career. ... Henson entered the game with one assist but had three in the first 6:37 of the game.  
 
 NOTABLE : After rallying from 27 points down for their victory Monday in Chicago, the Bucks fell behind by as many as 22 in the third quarter. Bucks coach  Scott Skiles  started the fourth quarter with the same lineup he used in the fourth quarter Monday. This time there was no big rally. ... Knicks guard  Jason Kidd  missed his second straight game with back spasms. Kidd did not travel to Milwaukee.   
 
 UP NEXT : For the Knicks, Friday vs. Washington, Sunday vs. Phoenix, Wednesday @ Charlotte. For the Bucks, Friday @ Minnesota, Saturday vs. Boston, Monday @ New Orleans.
