  Notebook: Heat 114, Bucks 96 Posted Monday February 13, 2012 11:33PM By Rick Braun, for NBA.com THE FACTS: LeBron James  scored 35 points in just 33 minutes, and  Dwyane Wade  added 22 as the Miami Heat scored a little payback with a 114-96 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks Monday night at the Bradley Center. Miami (22-7) has won 14 of its last 17, with two of the three losses in that stretch coming to the Bucks on Jan. 22 at Miami and Feb. 1 in Milwaukee. Carlos Delfino  scored 24 points to lead the Bucks (12-16). Milwaukee has now lost its last four home games. The Heat won Sunday night in Atlanta and has a chance to sweep three road games in three nights when it visits Indiana Tuesday night. QUOTABLE:  "At the start of the game we lost the first three or four skirmishes (for loose balls) but from that point on we really made a commitment to get into this fight. No one could spectate. We had to get our hands dirty, which we didn't do in the first two games. But it was a good sign that we did it this way against a very physical team."  --  Heat head coach  Erik Spoelstra , who said his team lost nearly every battle for 50-50 loose balls in two previous losses to Milwaukee. THE STAT:  After averaging just 89.5 points in their two losses to the Bucks, the Heat surpassed that by the end of the third quarter in this one, leading 90-74, after three. TURNING POINT: Mike Miller  drained two 3-pointers in a 12-2 second quarter run that took the Heat from a 41-35 deficit to a 47-43 lead. The Heat led by 55-50 at the half and pulled away in the third quarter. QUOTABLE II:  "We knew it. And they beat us, twice, handily. They played great fourth quarters and beat us and they held us under our averages offensively, so we made a conscious effort to try to get to our game. Like we played last night, we wanted to try to do the same thing tonight and we did that."  --  James on motivation because the Bucks had won the previous two meetings. HOT:  James entered the game shooting 53.8 percent from the field and pushed that number up by going 16 for 21 with an array of post-up jumpers and dunks. NOT:  Bucks center  Drew Gooden  was a frigid 2 for 14 after averaging 21.8 points in his previous five games. He did go 8 for 8 from the line, though, to finish with 12 points. ROOKIE WATCH:  Heat point guard  Norris Cole  contributed 10 points off the bench, including 6-of-6 shooting from the line. NOTABLE:  The Heat has won its last four road games by an average of 18.8 points. ... Miami shot 51.8 percent on the night, but the starters shot 64 percent (32 for 50). ... Delfino was 5 of 8 on 3-pointers and is 9 of 13 on threes in his last two games and 16 of 24 in his last four games. ... Second-year center  Dexter Pittman  missed the game with a bruised shoulder he suffered Sunday night at Atlanta and is day-to-day. UP NEXT:  For the Heat, Tuesday @ Indiana, Friday @ Cleveland, Sunday vs. Orlando. For the Bucks, Wednesday vs. New Orleans, Friday @ Orlando, Sunday @ New Jersey.
