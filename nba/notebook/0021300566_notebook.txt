 THE FACT:   Jimmy Butler  played a franchise-record 60 minutes and blocked a shot in the final seconds to help the Chicago Bulls win. 
 
 THE LEAD:   Joakim Noah  had 26 points, 19 rebounds and six assists and the Bulls rallied from a 15-point deficit in regulation to defeat the Orlando Magic 128-125 in triple-overtime, winning for the ninth time in 12 games. Rookie  Victor Oladipo , who came just seconds short of a franchise record with 57 minutes, 11 seconds, scored a career-high 35 points for the Magic (10-29), who lost their ninth straight.  Jameer Nelson  added 31 points and 10 assists before limping off with cramps with 1.5 seconds left in the final overtime. Chicago (18-19) led by one point with 2.8 seconds left when Butler came out of nowhere to get a piece of  Glen Davis ' jump shot. Noah got the rebound and Butler (21 points, seven rebounds, six assists) iced the win with two free throws. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It's just effort. I knew he was going to take that shot; you just jump up there and challenge him." 
 -- Butler 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Butler played 60 minutes and 22 seconds, a Bulls record and an NBA season high. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Magic led by nine points early in the fourth quarter when Butler drew a foul on a drive. His two free throws produced the first points on an 11-2 Chicago run that tied the game. 
 
 HOT:  With Oladipo driving for eight layups, the Magic shot 30-for-43 (69.8 percent) over a 27-minute period from late in the first quarter to early in the fourth. The third quarter (14-for-19) was their best shooting quarter of the season. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "One thing about Vic -- he's faster than a hiccup. As soon as you blink, he's gone. He just takes advantage of the seams and he's doing a better job of recognizing what's going on, how teams are playing him.'' 
 -- Nelson on Oladipo. 
 
 
 NOT:  The Bulls missed their first 10 3-point shots before finishing a respectable 12-for-33. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Although he blocked only two shots, the 6-foot-11 Noah altered several perimeter jump shots late in the game by switching out on Magic guards. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "There's not many players like (Noah). His all-around defense, every aspect -- from the rebounding effort to seeing things early, how they're developing  . . . But the most important thing is his ability to make two, three or four efforts on the same play. Oftentimes I don't know how he gets to the ball. It's just great effort. I think when you see those types of things, that helps unite and inspire your team." 
 -- Bulls coach  Tom Thibodeau 
 
 
 BAD MOVE:  After  Mike Dunleavy ' s  3-pointer tied it 111-111, the Magic had the ball with 13.4 seconds left in the first overtime. Nelson kept the ball for the entire time, then couldn't get a shot off over Noah before the time expired. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:   Carlos Boozer's  23 points were produced in only 28 minutes. The Bulls forward was not feeling well and there was some thought he might not even play. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  To counter Oladipo's big game, Bulls rookie  Tony Snell  opened the second overtime with a thunderous dunk and the third overtime with a 3-pointer, finishing with 15 points and seven rebounds. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Magic played without center  Nik Vucevic  (concussion) and leading-scorer  Arron Afflalo  (strained right foot). ... The Magic are 0-4 in overtime and 1-21 when they give up 100 points. ... 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Bulls: Friday @ Washington, Saturday vs. Philadelphia, Monday vs. L.A. Lakers. For the Magic: Friday vs. Charlotte, Sunday vs. Boston, Tuesday @ Brooklyn.
