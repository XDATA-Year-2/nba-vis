 THE FACT:  The Grizzlies have scored 100 or more points in five consecutive games for the first time since Feb. 13-26, 2011. 
 
 THE LEAD:  All five starters scored in double figures for Memphis as the Grizzlies (17-19) beat the Atlanta Hawks, 108-101, Sunday night at FedExForum.  Mike Conley  continued his hot streak, scoring 21 points to with 13 assists and four steals.  Zach Randolph  had 18 points and 12 rebounds and  Mike Miller  came off the bench to score 15 points. The Hawks (20-18) were led by  Paul Millsap's  21 points and six rebounds while  Jeff Teague  added 20 points and five assists. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It's coming, slowly but surely. We're starting to play better as a unit, which obviously breed confidence. We're starting to win games like that, which helps. Right now, we're plugging away and getting better."  --  Miller 
 
 
 THE STAT : Conley was responsible for 23 of the Grizzlies first 25 points in the fourth quarter due to his scoring or playmaking. Conley finished the period with eight points and six assists. 
 
 TURNING POINT : After falling behind, 77-64 with 1:55 left in the third quarter, the Hawks went on a 16-0 run that gave them an 80-77 lead with 10:11 left in the game. That's when Conley re-entered the game and got the Grizzlies back on track to win their second game in a row for just the third time this season. 
 
 HOT:  Grizzlies guard  Courtney Lee  made the most of his first since being acquired in a trade with Boston Jan. 7. Lee scored 15 points on 7-for-12 shooting, including long jumper at the halftime buzzer that gave the Grizzlies a 48-41 lead.  
 
 NOT:  Atlanta guard  Lou Williams  failed to make a shot in his six attempts. He finished the game with just four points, all coming from the free throw line.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I think we were feeling good about ourselves. We had another really bad start tonight and put ourselves in the whole. It took a lot of energy to get back. They're a good team and they're tough down low, and they're really good in the paint. It took a little too much energy to dig out of the hole."  --  Atlanta guard  Kyle Korver 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Grizzlies snapped a three-game losing to streak to the Hawks at FedExForum, where they hadn't beaten Atlanta since April 15, 2009. ... Atlanta is now 1-6 on the road against teams in the Western Conference. Its 6-13 overall road record is the worst of any NBA team with a winning record. ... The Grizzlies shot .518 from the floor, snapping Atlanta's six-game streak of holding opponents to under .450 shooting from the field. ... The Grizzlies had a season-high 13 steals. ... Randolph played in his 800th career game as he posted his 20th double-double in his last 27 games. He is four double-doubles shy of tying  Pau Gasol 's team record of  189.  
 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Hawks, Thursday vs. Brooklyn (London), Jan. 20 vs. Miami, Jan. 22 @ Orlando. For the Grizzlies, Tuesday vs. Oklahoma City, Wednesday @ Milwaukee, Friday vs. Sacramento.
