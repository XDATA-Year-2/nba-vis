 THE FACT: Shawn Marion  surpassed the 17,000-point plateau with 20 points. He became the 82nd player in NBA history to reach the mark, and joined  Hakeem Olajuwon ,  Kevin Garnett  and  Karl Malone  as the only players with 17,000 points, 9,000 rebounds, 1,500 steals and 1,000 blocks. 
 
 THE LEAD:   Blake Griffin  scored nine of his 25 points in the fourth quarter, and  DeAndre Jordan  tallied a career-high 25 points to help propel the Clippers to a 119-112 come-from-behind win over Dallas Friday night at the American Airlines Center. 
 Down seven late in the fourth, the Clippers (23-12) stormed back to tie the game at 110-110 before  Dirk Nowitzki , who scored a team-high 24 points, canned a jumper to give Dallas (19-14) a two-point advantage. Griffin answered right back, hitting a tough shot at the rim while being fouled and knocking down the ensuing free throw to give the Clippers a lead it would not let go.  
 While Los Angeles pulled out the victory, it had to do so without the services of star point guard  Chris Paul  down the stretch. Holding a 77-75 advantage midway through the third quarter, Paul was fouled driving to the basket and landed awkwardly on his right shoulder. Noticeably frustrated, Paul was taken to the locker room where he was diagnosed with a separated shoulder. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I was really proud of our guys. We started out awful and they scored everything, and we just kind of hung there and cut it to three by halftime ... We started switching, making up our own defense, which we had to do tonight. It was one of those games where everybody was making shots, so good hard win for us." 
 -- Clippers coach  Doc Rivers 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Griffin and Jordan cleaned the glass with efficiency, totaling 33 combined rebounds. Dallas as a team notched just 39 boards.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  Down 110-103 with under four minutes to play, the Clippers closed the game on a 16-2 run to pull out the victory.   
 
 QUOBTABLE II:  "As hard as we worked to get the lead back up to seven in the fourth, we just gave it up too easy. Defensively, they went right through us and offensively, without getting stops, the shots got harder. It's on every one of us, coaches and players, and it's very disappointing because it was an opportunity lost." 
 -- Mavericks coach  Rick Carlisle 
 
 
 HOT:  Jordan abused Dallas throughout the night in the paint, hitting his first eight shots from the field en route to a career night. ... Both teams were on fire in the first half, as Dallas held a 70-67 advantage heading into the intermission behind 60.4 percent shooting from the field. Los Angeles was right there with them, connecting on 56.1 percent of its first-half shots. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Griffin added 15 rebounds, five assists and a block, while hitting 11-for-13 shots from the free-throw line. ... Before leaving the game, Paul tied his career high with five 3-pointers, all in the first half. ...  Darren Collison  held his own in Paul's absence, scoring a season-high 20 points coming off the bench against his former team. ... Nowitzki connected on 4-for-5 attempts from beyond the arc. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:   Shane Larkin  provided a spark off the Dallas bench, scoring eight points, grabbing four boards and handing out three assists in just 14 minutes. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Playing 33 minutes, Nowitzki passed  Michael Jordan  for 23rd place on the NBA's all-time list for minutes played. ... Dallas set season highs for points in the first quarter (39) and points in the first half (70). ... Just seven Clippers played more than 10 minutes. ... Rivers said after the game that he expects Paul to miss 3-5 weeks.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Sunday vs. New York, Tuesday vs. L.A. Lakers, Wednesday @ San Antonio. For the Clippers, Saturday @ San Antonio, Monday vs. Orlando, Wednesday vs. Boston.
