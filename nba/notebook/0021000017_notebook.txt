
 Wizards-Magic notebook   By Dick Scanlon, for NBA.com Posted Friday October 29, 2010 12:46AM THE FACTS: Dwight Howard  scored 23 points and grabbed 10 rebounds and the Orlando Magic opened the season -- and their new arena -- with a 112-83 blowout of the Washington Wizards. The Magic shot 56 percent and had an overwhelming 53-25 rebound advantage. Rookie guard  John Wall , the first overall pick in the NBA Draft, had 14 points and nine assists for the Wizards. QUOTABLE:  "You're concerned when you bring a young team into this type of environment. We played scared. We had 49 missed shots and we only had three offensive rebounds."  --  Washington coach   Flip Saunders . THE STAT:  Howard shot 10 free throws in the first quarter and 19 for the game, making only nine. HOT:  The Magic's starters shot 29-for-42 (69 percent). NOT:  The Wizards' Andray Blatche went scoreless in 15 first-half minutes, missing all five shots. TURNING POINT:   Vince Carter  scored five points, and Howard and  Rashard Lewis  added four each on a 15-2 first-quarter run that left the Magic with a 24-7 lead. The lead never again got under 13. INSIDE THE ARENA:  David Stern  joined in the chorus of praise for Orlando's new $380 million Amway Center. "I've traveled the world, and there's nothing really better than this facility," the NBA commissioner declared in a pre-game press conference. ROOKIE WATCH:  Wall's first NBA points came on a goaltending call on Howard. He had five assists in the third quarter. "For my first game, a road game against one of the top teams that went to the Finals two years ago, it was pretty tough," he said. NOTABLE:  No Magic starter played in the fourth quarter. The Magic play at Miami on Friday night. UP NEXT:  For the Wizards, Saturday @ Atlanta, Tuesday vs. Philadelphia, Friday @ New York. For the Magic, Friday at Miami, Tuesday at New York, Wednesday vs. Minnesota.
