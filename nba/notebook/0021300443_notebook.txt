 THE FACT:  The Denver Nuggets have lost six straight games for the first time since Dec. 17-27, 2004. 
 
 THE LEAD:  For the second straight home game, the Memphis Grizzlies' bench produced a season-high point total, this time tossing in 62 points to lead the Grizzlies to a 120-99 win over Denver Saturday night at FedExForum. The Grizzlies (13-16) had four players come off the bench and score in double figures, led by forward  Ed Davis ' 17 points.  Zach Randolph  led the team with 20 points. The Nuggets (14-15) were led by  Ty Lawson 's 20 points and eight assists.  Wilson Chandler  added 19.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I'm pretty athletic. Every now and again I use my frequent flyer miles. JB [ Jerryd Bayless ] led the break, he kicked it, and after that it's pretty much three-man weave and I'm going to go get it."  
 -- Grizzlies forward  James Johnson  on blocking  Randy Foye 's 3-point shot 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Grizzlies reached the 120-point mark for the first time since Jan. 21, 2012 when they scored 128 against Sacramento. It is a season high in points for the Grizzlies, and the second-most points allowed by Denver this season. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Trailing the Nuggets 56-55 at the half, Memphis turned to its defensive roots in the second half. In the third quarter, the Grizzlies held Denver to 31.6 percent shooting (6-for-19), and outscored the Nuggets 30-16. 
 
 HOT:  In addition to scoring 62 points, the Grizzlies bench shot a combined 23-for-35 (.657) from the floor, and were 7-for-13 (.538) from 3-point range. Davis was 6-for-8 from the floor, while Bayless was 6-for-10 for 15 points and James Johnson was 5-for-7 for 14. 
 
 NOT:  Prior to missing two games with a left thigh contusion, Grizzlies guard  Mike Conley  was playing at an All-Star level, averaging a team-high 18 points. Since returning, Conley has struggled to regain that form. Conley was 5-for-14 from the floor against Denver for 14 points. In his four games back from the injury, Conley is shooting .263 (15-for-57) from the floor, and averaging 10 points. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It was a thorough ripping all the way through. ... It was just a thorough whooping from beginning to end. After we had a pretty decent first half, then we gave up 30 points in the third quarter and 35 in the fourth quarter. You are not going to win any games, especially on the road, against any team giving up numbers like that."  
 -- Denver coach  Brian Shaw 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Grizzlies' 21-point victory ended a string of eight straight games against the Nuggets that were decided by single digits. It also is the Grizzlies' most lopsided win over Denver in the all-time series. ... The Nuggets entered the game as the second-best rebounding team in the NBA, averaging 46.46 per game, but were outrebounded by the Grizzlies 46-25. Former Nugget center  Kosta Koufos  led the way with 12. Denver also ranked fifth in the league with 12.86 offensive rebounds per game, but was held to just six. ... It was a tale of two halves offensively for the Nuggets. After shooting .571 from the floor and scoring 56 points in the first half, the Nuggets shot .371 after the break and scored just 43 points. ... Making a second straight start for Denver,  Jordan Hamilton  scored 12 points on 4-for-8 shooting. He scored eight of his points in the first quarter, and the rest in the second. ... Forward  Kenneth Faried  returned to action for Denver after missing the last two games with a left ankle sprain. He played 13 minutes against the Grizzlies, going 0-for-3 from the floor and finishing with three points and two rebounds. Forward  Darrell Arthur , a former Grizzly, missed his second straight game with a right quadriceps contusion. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Nuggets, Monday vs. Miami, Wednesday vs. Philadelphia, Friday vs. Memphis. For the Grizzlies, Monday vs. Chicago, Thursday at Phoenix, Friday at Denver.
