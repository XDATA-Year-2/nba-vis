 THE FACTS: Beno Udrih, Jameer Nelson  and  Arron Afflalo  hit 3-pointers in the final 4 1/2 minutes to help the Orlando Magic pull away from an 85-85 tie to a 99-91 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers. 
 Nelson, winning his matchup against All-Star point guard  Jrue Holiday , led Orlando to its first homecourt victory in four weeks with 24 points and 10 assists. He assisted Udrih's 3-pointer with 4:33 left to break the tie, then answered Holiday's basket with a 3-pointer of his own. 
 
 Thaddeus Young  had 26 points and 12 rebounds for the 76ers, who lost their fifth straight game and 13th straight road game 
 
 . 
 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "No matter where you're at, against whoever, a win is always something." --  Magic forward  Tobias Harris. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The 76ers scored 30 points in the first quarter and 61 in the next three quarters. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We held them to 40 points in the second half. That'll give you a chance to win every single night, whether shots are going in, whether the 3-ball is going in, whether you get to the free-throw line or not. Playing defense like that gives you a chance to win." --  Magic coach  Jacque Vaughn. 
 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The 76ers were down, 91-89, with Holiday at the free throw line with 2:15 remaining. A 78 percent foul shooter, Holiday missed both. 
 
 HOT:  Young made 13-of-17 shots and is shooting 77 percent (33-for-43) in his last three games. 
 
 NOT:  Holiday shot 4-for-16 and finished with eight points. He is shooting 27 percent (20-for-75) in his last five games. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Magic flooded the floor with guards in the fourth quarter, Udrih playing the whole period and Nelson playing almost 11 minutes. Udrih finished the game with plus/minus of plus-17. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The 76ers did not respond to the Magic's strategy, leaving shooters open for 3-points looks. The Magic cashed in with 5-of-8 shooting from long range in the final nine minutes.  
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "They just made shots at the end. I think we played good defense but they made some tough shots." --  Thaddeus Young. 
 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Magic forward  Andrew Nicholson  did not play for the first time in 23 games . . .  Arnett Moultrie  played 11 scoreless minutes for the 76ers. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Nelson did not play in either of the Magic's other two games against the 76ers . . . Two of the Magic's last three wins have come against the 76ers. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the 76ers: Monday vs. Brooklyn, Wednesday vs. Miami, Saturday vs. Indiana. For the Magic: Tuesday vs. L.A. Lakers, Friday @ Oklahoma City, Sunday @ Milwaukee.
