 THE FACTS: The Chicago Bulls defeated the Toronto Raptors 107-105 in overtime at the Air Canada Centre on Wednesday night. Despite giving up a 19-point lead, the Bulls (22-15) won their second game in a row and fourth on the road.  Carlos Boozer' s season-high 36 points and 12 rebounds led Chicago, while  Luol Deng  added 19 points and seven assists.  Joakim Noah  had a double-double with 16 points and 14 rebounds, while  Rip Hamilton  scored 15. 
 The Bulls ended the first half up 52-44, behind Boozer's solid play with 25 points. The third quarter was a series of runs for both teams, which saw the Bulls lead grow to as high as 19, while the Raptors (14-25) clawed to within six points to close the quarter, 79-73. Both teams shot a low 35 percent from the field in the fourth quarter, but Lowry scored 12 points and helped the Raptors close out the quarter on a 10-5 run.  Amir Johnson  had an opportunity to put the game away with two free throws with 12.1 seconds left, but made one of his two and tied the game at 100-all, sending it to overtime. With eight seconds left in overtime,  Kyle Lowry  made a floater to tie the game at 105-105, but Deng responded with an 18-foot jumper with 3.8 seconds left to put them up 107-105.  Jose Calderon  had an opportunity to win the game with an open 3-point shot with one second left on the clock, but it didn't fall. 
  The bench led the Raptors, as  Alan Anderson  tied a career-high with 27 points and Lowry added 26 points and seven assists.  DeMar DeRozan  scored 18 points and  Ed Davis  contributed 11. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "I've been in the league for a while now, I know what I can do and what I can't do. When it comes to the last minutes in a game, I'm not as nervous or worried about what I'm going to do as I used to." 
 -- Bulls forward Loul Deng on taking the last minute shot 
 
 THE STAT : Fouls ... Chicago committed 30 personal fouls and Toronto committed 29, with three players fouling out between both teams. There were numerous whistles blown and stoppages in play that really formulated how close the game was in the fourth quarter and overtime. 
 
 TURNING POINT : Chicago inbounded the ball with 8.7 seconds left in overtime after Lowry's floater tied the game at 105-105. Deng made an 18-foot jumper to give the Bulls their final lead at 107-105 with 3.8 seconds on the clock. Subsequently, Calderon missed an open 3-pointer with one second left on the clock. 
 
 HOT : Boozer was ready to go, starting the game on a tear with 17 points, five rebounds and three assists in the first quarter alone. He finished the game with 36 points and 12 rebounds and has posted double-doubles in 11 of his last 13 games against Toronto. 
 
 NOT : Chicago's starters put the ball in the basket, however, their bench didn't fare as well. They were outscored 66-18 by the Raptors, shooting 5-for-21 from the field, and 7-for-14 from the free-throw line. 
 
 GOOD MOVE : While Calderon stepped in and played splendidly when Lowry was out with a triceps injury, Lowry was never inserted back into the starting lineup on his return. Raptors coach Dwane Casey maintained he would be eased back into the rotation. Tonight, Casey gave the keys back to Lowry, not letting him start, but keeping him in the game for major minutes and Lowry produced. 
 
 BAD MOVE : With 30 seconds left and the Raptors down 100-99, Toronto had a chance to go for a two-for-one with Boozer running up the court with his shoe in his hand. But Casey called time out to run a play. 
 
 NOTABLE : Chicago is 9-0 when scoring 100 or more points. Toronto is 0-19 when giving up triple digits in points. ... Boozer's 21 double-doubles leads the Eastern Conference. ... Chicago has won eight of its last nine meetings against Toronto. After winning 10 of 13, the Raptors have lost their last three games. ... Chicago outscored Toronto 54-36 in the paint. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Raptors, Friday @ Philadelphia, Wednesday at Dallas, Sunday vs. Lakers, Wednesday @ Miami. For the Bulls, Friday @ Boston, Saturday vs. Memphis and Monday vs. Lakers.
