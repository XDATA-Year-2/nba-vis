  Notebook: Heat 113, Raptors 101 Posted Friday March 30, 2012 11:05PM By Duane Watson, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  The Miami Heat (37-13) defeated the Toronto Raptors (17-35) 113-101 on Friday night at a sold out Air Canada Centre, winning their seventh in a row against the Raptors. Miami started the game on a 20-6 run and had as large as a 14-point lead, but the Raptors brought it to a tie after three quarters at 83-83. The Heart and Raptors traded baskets up to the eight minute mark until the Raptors hit a drought and were eventually outscored 30-18 in the fourth quarter.  Dwyane Wade  scored 13 points in the decisive quarter, but it was really an effort by the big three dominating the game. Wade finished with 30 points, six assists and three steals, while  Chris Bosh  also scored 30 points and eight rebounds.  LeBron James  rounded out the trio with 26 points, nine assists and four rebounds. The Raptors were lead by  DeMar DeRozan's  28 points,  Andrea Bargnani  scored 27 points and Amir Johnson had a double-double with 12 points and 12 rebounds.  Jose Calderon  dished out a game high 16 assists. The Raptors are 1-2 on their current homestand and Miami gets a needed win after losing 6 of their last 8 games on the road. QUOTABLE:  "You got to be fired up to win basketball games it's a rough league. You just have to bring energy and that's how I have fun, I just bring some energy, play as hard as possible and let it all hang out."   -- Bosh THE STAT:  The Heat scored 64 of their 113 points in the paint. Lobs, dunks, alley-oops or lay-ups were the order of the evening. The Heat's first 18 points of the game were all in the paint en route to an 18-4 run to start the match. TURNING POINT:  Although the game was tied at 83 points going into the fourth quarter the Raptors were held scoreless from 8:58 for almost three minutes where the Heat went on an 8-0 run. With the teams trading baskets until that point that run provided enough of a cushion for the Heat as the Raptors were unable to bridge that gap for the remainder of the game. QUOTABLE II:  "We're not really worried about how pretty it looks. We're just trying to continue to play good basketball, continue to play well."   --  Wade HOT:  The Big Three were too much for the Raptors and Bosh, James and Wade all took turns stepping up for the Heat at various points of the game. They accounted for 86 of the Heat's 113 points and shot a combined .618 34-for-55 from the field. NOTABLE:  Miami shot an opponent season-high .571 (44-for-77) from the field and scored a season-high 64 points in the paint... Miami is 23-3 when scoring 100+ points...  Udonis Haslem  didn't travel to Toronto due to personal reasons.... The Heat's  Mike Miller  (ankle) and Raptors  Jerryd Bayless  (torn oblique) were out of the lineup due to injury... With the win Miami is 16-11 on the road and lead the season series against Toronto 2-0 UP NEXT:  Toronto vs. Washington on Sunday, on Tuesday vs. Charlotte and @ Philadelphia on Wednesday. Miami concludes its road trip on Sunday @ Boston and return home vs. Philadelphia on Tuesday and vs. Oklahoma City on Wednesday.
