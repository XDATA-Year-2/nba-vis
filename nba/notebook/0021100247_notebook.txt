  Notebook: Thunder 99, Pistons 79   By Randy Renner, for NBA.com Posted Tuesday January 24, 2012 12:34AM THE FACTS:  The Oklahoma City Thunder used a combination of smothering defense and hot shooting to blister the Detroit Pistons 99-79 inside Chesapeake Energy Arena on Monday. The Pistons missed 12 of their first 14 shots and trailed by as many as 32 points. The Thunder used a three-headed monster to dominate the game.  James Harden  (24),  Russell Westbrook  (24) and  Kevin Durant  (20) each had at least 20 points in the first three quarters. Harden played four minutes of the fourth quarter but didn't score. Neither Durant nor Westbrook got off the bench in the last quarter, the fifth time this season the Thunder starters have been able to rest the entire fourth quarter.  Brandon Knight  led Detroit with 13 points,  Greg Monroe  and  Rodney Stuckey  each added a dozen and  Jonas Jerebko  had 11. The Pistons are now 0-4 in OKC versus the Thunder. Oklahoma City moves to 14-3, tying the best start in franchise history. The 2005-06 Seattle SuperSonics also started 14-3. QUOTABLE:  "The defense set the tone from the first possession. We knew going in you have to bring it and we really got after it. That was important tonight."   -- Thunder coach  Scott Brooks QUOTABLE II:  "It was a good win for us, I try to come out defensively and affect the game. I thought we all did that tonight."   -- Westbrook THE STAT:  For the seventh time this season Oklahoma City held an opponent to less than 40 percent shooting. Detroit managed to make just 34.1 percent of its shots (28-for-82). In the first quarter. Oklahoma City held the Pistons to just 16.7 percent (3-for-18) to jump out to a 29-12 lead. By halftime, Detroit had improved only a little to 26.8 percent and trailed 60-33. TURNING POINT:  The Thunder put the clamps on this one early, leading by 10 halfway through the first quarter and by 17 at the end of the opening 12 minutes. The Thunder outscored Detroit 15-1 on the break and 14-2 in the paint in the first quarter. The lead ballooned out to 32 (56-24) with 4:31 left in the second. The Pistons, who've struggled all season offensively, just never could get anything going against Oklahoma City's attacking defense. QUOTABLE III:  "Look we had shots at the rim, in the first quarter we had I think nine shots within three feet and we missed them all, they were either blocked or led to their fast breaks. It's very disappointing to put forth that type of performance."   -- Pistons coach  Lawrence Frank HOT:  Oklahoma City was 12-for-21 (57.1 percent) in the first quarter. ... Westbrook was 6-for-8 in the first 12 minutes. ... Harden hit six of his first seven shots and was 4-for-4 on 3-pointers in the first 20 minutes of the game. ... OKC shot 58.5 percent (24-for-41) in the first half. ... The Thunder finished at 53.2 percent. ... Harden finished 8-for-11 including 5-for-6 on 3-pointers. ... Westbrook ended the night 11-for-17. NOT:  The Pistons made just two of their first 14 shots (14.3 percent) and finished the quarter with just 12 points on 3-for-18 shooting (16.7 percent). Most of those misses were from in close (1-for-9 in the paint). ... Monroe was just 1-for-8 in the first quarter and 0-for-2 in the second. ... Monroe finished 3-for-14. ...  Austin Daye  was 3-for-10 and  Walker Russell  was 0-for-5. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Westbrook's parents came into town from Los Angeles for Westbrook's contract extension news conference on Sunday and were among those in the crowd. Durant's mother and grandmother also watched the game from court-side seats. GOOD MOVE:  Westbrook, standing at the top of the arc, drives around Brandon Knight then past a screen set by  Kendrick Perkins  to deliver a tomahawk slam in the first quarter. GOOD MOVE TOO:  Moments later Westbrook, leading a fast break, brings the sell-out crowd to its feet with a left-handed, behind-the-back pass to Durant, who lays it in and gets fouled. QUOTABLE IV:  "I'm actually naturally left-handed. I know that surprises some people."   -- Westbrook GOOD MOVE III:  In the second quarter Thunder defensive wiz  Thabo Sefolosha  stopped a 3-on-1 fast break by blocking a shot and grabbing the rebound. NOTABLE:  Thunder big men  Serge Ibaka  (five) and Perkins (one) continued their season-long block party. Ibaka and Perkins are the only teammates to block at least one shot in every game this season, Ibaka has now blocked a shot in 30 straight games, the longest streak in the NBA. ... The 12 points allowed in the first quarter and 33 points in the first half were the fewest allowed by Oklahoma City this season. ... Thunder forward  Nick Collison  left the game in the second quarter with a sprained left ankle and did not return. UP NEXT:  For the Pistons, Wednesday vs Miami, Friday vs Atlanta, Saturday @ Philadelphia. For the Thunder, Wednesday vs New Orleans, Friday @ Golden State, Monday @ L.A. Clippers.
