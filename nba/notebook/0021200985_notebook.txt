 THE FACTS: The Miami Heat tied the second-longest winning streak in NBA history at 22 games, defeating the Toronto Raptors 108-91 on Sunday at Air Canada Centre. Miami (51-14) started their streak on February 3 in Toronto, and have yet to lose since. They were led by  Dwyane Wade 's 24 points and nine assists and  LeBron James ' 22 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists.  Ray Allen  scored 20 off the bench, including 16 in the fourth quarter, while ex-Raptor  Chris Bosh  added 18. 
 In an exhibition of ugly basketball, Miami came out on top in the first half 55-43. However, the Raptors (26-41) bounced back in the third quarter behind 14 points by  Rudy Gay  and ended it on a 12-2 run, with eight points from  DeMar DeRozan . They outscored the Heat 30-14, closing the frame, down only three points at 76-73. 
 The Raptors jumped out to tie the game at 77-77 with 11:07 in the fourth quarter, then Miami went on a decisive 28-4 run powered by Allen's 16 points for their biggest lead of the game of 24 points with just over four minutes left in the game at 105-81. That effectively slammed the door on a Toronto comeback. 
 Toronto was led by Gay's 27 points and eight rebounds and  Amir Johnson 's 18 point and 18 rebound double-double. Rookie center  Jonas Valanciunas  scored 18 points with seven rebounds, while DeRozan and  Terrence Ross  both chipped in 12 points. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "It's a special team. It's a special ride right now that we're on and I think the best thing about it is we're doing it together. We're doing it for one another and just want to try to keep it going. It's not about the streak, it's about us getting better each and every day, preparing to win each and every night and we've been fortunate to do that." 
 -- Heat forward LeBron James on the 22-game winning streak 
 
 THE STAT : The Raptors shot 23.8 percent in the fourth quarter, after only trailing the Heat by 3 points after three quarters. They outperformed Miami in a number of statistical categories, but their inability to put the ball in the net when it mattered is what cost them the game. 
 
 TURNING POINT : After the Raptors rallied to tie the game at 77-77, Miami showed why they haven't lost in six weeks, going on a commanding 28-4 run to put the game out of reach at 105-81 with 4:16 left.  
 
 QUOTABLE II : "When we started playing better two months ago, it was about the process. It would be disingenuous if it changed right now and its about the result. It's about trying to get better and playing our game to raise our level." 
 -- Heat coach  Erik Spoelstra  on the winning streak 
 
 HOT : Allen came off the bench for Miami in the fourth quarter and scored 16 points to break the game open, shooting 5-for-6 from the field and 4-for-5 from behind the 3-point line. He finished with 20 points for the game. 
 
 NOT : The Raptors backcourt of  Kyle Lowry  and DeRozan were stifled by the Heat defense, shooting a combined 5-for-24 from the field for 12 points, three assists and six turnovers. 
 
 NOTABLE : James' double-double was his 32nd of the season, a career-high. ... Miami's Allen became the all-time career opponent scoring leader for total points against the Raptors; (1093) he has also played 55 games versus Toronto -- most in franchise history. ... Miami's  Shane Battier  was also a member of the Houston Rockets' 22-win team. ... Toronto has now lost seven of their last 10 games and their last 11 consecutive games against Miami. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Raptors, Wednesday @ Charlotte, Friday vs. New York, Saturday @ New York. For the Heat, Monday @ Boston, Wednesday @ Cleveland and Friday vs. Detroit.
