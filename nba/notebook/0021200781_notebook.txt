 THE FACTS:  Reserve guard  Will Bynum  scored 20 points off the bench, including 12 in the fourth quarter, and added a team-high eight assists as the Detroit Pistons snapped the Washington Wizards' four-game winning streak with a 96-85 victory at The Palace of Auburn Hills on Wednesday. The Pistons outscored the Wizards in the fourth quarter, 31-17.  Jose Calderon  fired in a season-high 24 points and  Greg Monroe  recorded his eighth consecutive double-double with 16 points and 18 rebounds for the Pistons, who have won three of their last four.  Emeka Okafor  led the Wizards (15-36) with 20 points and nine rebounds and  John Wall  had 16 points and nine assists. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Will and Jose, they're somewhat different players but they're just tough guys to guard. Will's ability to get to the rack and Jose's ability to spread the floor presents different things for teams to guard." 
 -- Detroit forward  Kyle Singler  on point guards Bynum and Calderon, who were paired together down the stretch. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  2-26. The Pistons are not known for their fourth-quarter comebacks. They were down three entering the fourth, 68-65, and had won just one game trailing after three quarters. That just happened to be their previous victory, a 105-100 win at Milwaukee on Saturday when the outscored the Bucks 24-18 in the final 12 minutes. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The score was tied with five minutes remaining when Bynum took over the game. He made two free throws, a pullup jumper and a layup to give his club an 82-76 lead. Then he found Calderon in the corner for a 3-pointer before Singler's free throws finished the second of two 11-0 runs by Detroit during the quarter.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I've been talking to him in Ukrainian language about the lob, trying to get him to be the new  Andre Drummond  while he's out." 
 -- Bynum on Ukrainian rookie center  Slava Kravtsov , who converted a fourth-quarter alley-oop. Kravtsov is filling in for Drummond, who is out with a back injury. 
 
 
 HOT:  Monroe's eight consecutive double-doubles is the longest such streak by a Pistons since  Grant Hill  recorded 10 straight in March of 1996. He had 13 points and 11 rebounds by halftime. 
 
 NOT:  Washington's  Nene  was averaging 15.7 points, 8.5 rebounds and 4.3 assists in his last six games but he cooled off Wednesday, contributing just 10 points, two rebounds and four assists in 33 minutes. Nene was shadowed by a combination of players, including Monroe,  Jason Maxiel l and  Charlie Villanueva . 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Kravtsov also played well defensively during his 14-minute stint, closing off the lane and also making two steals. Singler had another solid outing with 12 points and seven rebounds. Wizards guard  Bradley Beal  had 10 points but was shut out in the second half, mainly by Calderon. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Detroit clinched the season series with its third win over Washington this season. It has won 16 of the last 20 meetings and the last six season series. ...  Brandon Knight  is the only Piston participating in All-Star Weekend. He will be in the Rising Stars Challenge, along with Beal, as well as the Skills Competition. ... The Wizards have held their last 10 opponents under 100 points. The last time they had a longer stretch of holding opponents under 100 was a 10-game streak from Dec. 6-26 in 2001. ... Washington is 10-8 since Wall returned from a knee injury. ... Detroit out-rebounded the Wizards 48-32.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Wizards, Tuesday vs. Toronto, Friday Feb. 22 vs. Denver, Saturday Feb. 23 vs. Houston. For the Pistons, Tuesday vs. Memphis, Wednesday @ Charlotte, Friday Feb. 22 @ Indiana.
