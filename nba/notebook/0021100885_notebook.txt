  Notebook: Mavericks 97, Trail Blazers 94 Posted Saturday April 14, 2012 2:05AM By Kerry Eggers, for NBA.com THE FACTS: Dirk Nowitzki  scored 17 of his game-high 24 points in the first half and Dallas held off a late Portland surge to win 97-94 Friday night at the Rose Garden. Delonte West  added 21 points, seven assists, six rebounds and three steals for the Mavericks (34-26), who led by 20 points in the second quarter and by 24 late in the third period. Nicolas Batum  collected 20 points and eight rebounds and  Jamal Crawford  chipped in 18 points off the bench for the Trail Blazers (28-32). QUOTABLE:  "You have to give (the Blazers) credit -- they are persistent. We made a lot of uncharacteristic mistakes, but we survived it."   --  Dallas head coach  Rick Carlisle . THE STAT:  Dallas won the rebound battle 51-38, including 30-20 in the first half. That helped the Mavericks survive 21 turnovers that turned into 30 Portland points. TURNING POINT:  The opening tip. Dallas jumped to a 9-0 lead, extended it to 30-16 after one quarter and 38-18 early in the second period. The Blazers outscored the visitors 33-16 in the fourth quarter, but it was too little, too late. HOT: Shawn Marion  knocked down 8 of 10 shots -- including his only 3-point attempt -- en route to a 17-point, 14-rebound performance. NOT:  Dallas'  Jason Terry  missed his first eight shots from the field and finished 3-for-16. Terry was 0-for-5 in the first quarter, the rest of the Mavericks 13-for-18. QUOTABLE II:  "Down 24 points to the defending champs ... I'm extremely proud and pleased of the effort our guys showed out there, especially down the stretch."  --  Portland head coach  Kaleb Canales . INSIDE THE ARENA:  The crowd announced at 20,304 was the 191st straight Rose Garden sellout for the Blazers dating to December 2007. GOOD MOVE:  With Portland power forward  LaMarcus Aldridge  out for the season with a hip injury, the Mavericks focused defensively on  J.J. Hickson  inside. Hickson finished with 13 points and 10 rebounds but was only 5 -or-12 from the field. BAD MOVE:  With the Blazers still in striking distance in the closing seconds but needing a 3-pointer, Crawford took a rebound and went to the basket for a layup that the Mavericks gladly conceded. QUOTABLE III:  "Right now, you just have to pile up 'W's.' I don't care how you get them; you just have to get them."   --  Marion. NOTABLE:  Crawford, who leads the NBA in free-throw percentage at .935, was 6-for-6 at the line to extend his consecutive streak to 36. UP NEXT:  For the Trail Blazers, @ Sacramento Sunday, @ Phoenix Monday, vs. Utah Wednesday. For the Mavericks, @ L.A. Lakers Sunday, @ Utah Monday, vs. Houston Wednesday.
