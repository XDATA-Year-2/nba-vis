 THE FACTS:   Brandon Jennings  scored 25 points and added seven assists and four steals, and  Luc Richard Mbah a Moute  added 19 points and a strong defensive job on  LeBron James  to lead the Milwaukee Bucks to a rousing 104-85 victory over the Miami Heat Saturday night at the Bradley Center. 
 
 Mike Dunleavy  had 18 points off the bench,  Larry Sanders  had 16 points, 11 rebounds and four blocked shots and  Monta Ellis  had 14 points, nine assists and five steals as the Bucks (16-12) survived a huge Miami third quarter. 
 James led the Heat (20-8) with 26, and  Dwyane Wade  added 24, but the two Miami stars also had nine turnovers -- more than Milwaukee's team total of six. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It was good resiliency on our part. To get down like we did in the second half after building a lead and then to be able to bounce back and make that run the last 15 minutes of the game was good. Hopefully we can build on that." 
 -- Mike Dunleavy on the Bucks' rally after being outscored 27-6 to open the second half 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Bucks' three-guard rotation of Jennings, Ellis and  Beno Udrih  combined for 20 assists and just one turnover. Every coach in America would take those numbers. As a team, the Bucks had 29 assists and just six turnovers. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Miami opened the third quarter with a 27-6 run that turned a 12-point deficit into a 71-62 lead. From there the Bucks outscored the Heat, 33-5 for a 95-76 lead. During Miami's run, the Bucks made 3-for-24. They followed that by making 13 of their next 18. Beginning with the last seven points of the third quarter, the Bucks outscored Miami 42-14 over the final 14:22.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It's a big win for us to get a win like this. We've got to enjoy this one and continue to go at it. We haven't been playing great at home. We needed to win a couple of games in a row at home. It was good to win a game like this against the defending champs." 
 -- Luc Richard Mbah a Moute 
 
 
 HOT:  Sanders finished 8-for-11 from the field, with four of his baskets coming in the big run early in the fourth quarter. 
 
 NOT:  While James and Wade combined to go 21-for-39, the rest of the Heat players were just 12-for-37. Miami's other three starters ( Shane Battier ,  Chris Bosh  and  Mario Chalmers ) went 7-for-23. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  For the second straight game, Ellis has added big steal (five) and assist (three) numbers to go with his scoring.  
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Bucks coach  Scott Skiles  removed Sanders from the game during a horrible third quarter and chewed him out. Sanders took the words to heart and had eight points, five rebounds and two blocks in nine fourth-quarter minutes. 
 
 BAD MOVE:   Mario Chalmers  delivered a running head-lock on Jennings in the open court with 5:45 left, earning a Flagrant-1 foul that led to four Milwaukee points. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The league learned Saturday that former NBA player  Jerome Whitehead  had died in San Diego last week at the age of 56. Whitehead, who played 11 NBA seasons, was a teammate with Bucks assistant coach  Jim Boylan  on the 1977 Marquette University team that won the NCAA championship. "Jerome was a great guy," Boylan said. "He had a great spirit about him. He was a quiet, gentle giant, but his play on the court was anything but. He was a man's man inside." ... Miami forward  Udonis Haslem  missed the game with a shoulder injury suffered in a collision with a sideline photographer in Detroit Friday night. ... The Heat entered the fourth quarter with a lead and lost for the first time this season. Miami led, 71-69, after three and was 15-0 with leads entering the fourth quarter. ... The Bucks moved into a virtual tie for the Central Division lead with Chicago and Indiana. ... The sellout crowd of 18,717 was the Bucks' first of the season.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Heat, Monday @ Orlando, Wednesday vs. Dallas, Friday vs. Chicago. For the Bucks, Sunday @ Detroit, Wednesday vs. San Antonio, Friday vs. Houston.
