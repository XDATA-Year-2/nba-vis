 THE FACT:  In its 139-105 romp at Philadelphia on Dec. 14, Portland set a franchise record by making 21 3-pointers. On Saturday night, the Trail Blazers were a season-worst 3-for-22 from beyond the arc. 
 
 THE LEAD: Thaddeus Young  tied his season high with 30 points as Philadelphia pulled out a dramatic 101-99 victory over Portland at the Moda Center.  Evan Turner  added 23 points and seven rebounds for the 76ers (12-21), who won their fourth straight game and finished with a 4-1 record on their five-game road trip. 
 
 LaMarcus Aldridge  scored 29 points and grabbed 14 rebounds for Portland (26-8), which lost for the fourth time at home this season.  Robin Lopez  collected 14 points and 15 rebounds for the Blazers. Portland had a chance to force overtime, but  Damian Lillard 's scoop shot failed in the final second. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I give the guys so much credit for fixing the thing that we were so poor at the last time. We dumped so much heart and soul into trying to guard the 3-point line."  
 -- Philadelphia coach  Brett Brown 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Blazers shot a season-worst .364 from the field and were hammered 64-40 in points in the paint. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Portland led 84-77 with seven minutes to go when Philadelphia went on a 13-0 run to seize a 90-84 lead.  
 
 HOT:  Young was 14-for-20 from the field, including 4-for-4 in the fourth quarter. His tip-in with 36.2 seconds left gave the 76ers a 96-94 lead they never relinquished. 
 
 NOT:  Portland's  Nicolas Batum  didn't score until late in the third quarter and finished 1-for-9 from the field. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:   "We got the look we wanted. I was able to get to the rim. That's a shot I have to make."  
 -- Damian Lillard on missing the final shot 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Trailing 99-95 with 14.3 seconds left, Portland coach  Terry Stotts  chose to save a timeout, moving upcourt quickly after the second of two free throws by Philadelphia's Spencer Hawes. It paid off when Lillard scored on a drive with 7.9 seconds remaining, and Lopez stole the in-bounds pass with 5.4 seconds to go. Stotts used the timeout to set up what turned out to be an excellent shot to tie. Lillard just missed it. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  After Portland's  Meyers Leonard  got an offensive rebound in the fourth quarter, he passed the ball out to a teammate. The man guarding him,  Lavoy Allen , forgot about Leonard, and the 7-foot-1 center broke to the basket, taking a bounce pass for a resounding dunk. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "Momentum is a crazy thing. Once you get it, you can't let it go. We have it right now, so we have to keep rolling with it."  
 -- 76ers'  Spencer Hawes 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Portland had tied its franchise record with 21 3-pointers (in 33 attempts) in its previous outing, a 134-104 rout of Charlotte Thursday night... Philadelphia won despite losing the rebound battle 59-43, yielding 19 off the offensive glass. ... Portland is 13-4 at home, 13-4 on the road. ... Aldridge passed  Jerome Kersey  to become the No. 4 career scorer in franchise history (10,068 points). ... Batum suffered an avulsion fracture of his left middle finger in the game's final minute. He is listed as probable for Tuesday's visit to Sacramento.  
 
 UP   NEXT:  For the 76ers, Monday vs. Minnesota, Tuesday @ Cleveland, Friday vs. Detroit. For the Trail Blazers, Tuesday @ Sacramento, Wednesday vs. Orlando, Saturday vs Boston.
