 THE FACT:  Dallas Mavericks forward  Dirk Nowitzki  passed  Alex English  for 13th place on the NBA's all-time scoring list with a 13-foot jumper in the opening minute of the third quarter of Monday's win over the Houston Rockets. After finishing with 31 points, Nowitzki needs 765 to leapfrog  John Havlicek  for No. 12.  
 
 THE LEAD:  Nowitzki tallied 31 points on 11-for-18 shooting, and  Monta Ellis  added 14 of his 18 points after halftime as the Mavericks torched the Rockets' perimeter defenders for a 111-104 victory at Toyota Center. Vince Carter poured in 16 points on 6-for-8 shooting off the bench for Dallas (16-12), which snapped a three-game road losing streak. 
 
 Dwight Howard  finished with 29 points and 15 rebounds to lead the Rockets (18-11), who had won nine of their previous 10 home contests.  Chandler Parsons  chipped in with 21 points and five boards, but Houston's lackadaisical defense and 18-turnover effort caught up to it in a second half in which it was dominated 61-47.   
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It was a must-win for us. We had to get back on track to feeling good again after two devastating losses that we figured came because we weren't playing our basketball within our system. Tonight, we came in with a great game plan and stuck to it." 
 -- Monta Ellis 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Dallas reached nine steals for the seventh consecutive game, with seven different Mavericks recording at least one theft. Dallas is averaging 11.3 steals over its last seven games.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  Houston entered halftime holding a 57-50 lead, but the Mavericks completely turned the tables on the Rockets in the final two periods of play. Fueled by smart decisions in transition and the sharpshooting of its perimeter scorers, who went 8-for-15 (53.3 percent) from 3-point land in the second half, Dallas steamrolled the Rockets 36-21 in the third quarter and never looked back.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We tried a bunch of different stuff. We tried showing and coming back. We tried staying on him. We tried running at him. Nothing seemed to work." 
 -- Rockets coach  Kevin McHale  on why his team failed to slow down  Dirk Nowitzki 
 
 
 HOT:  Howard continued his recent torrid stretch of play, posting his ninth double-double in the last 10 games. The 6-foot-11 center has averaged 26.5 points on 67.2 percent (43-for-64) shooting and 13.8 rebounds over his last four outings. 
 
 NOT:  Apart from handing out a few assists, Houston's  Francisco Garcia  was hardly effective filling in for the injured  James Harden  (ankle). Garcia not only shot 1-for-6 from the field, but also failed to stop Nowitzki on multiple possessions when the Rockets made one final push in the closing minutes. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Mavericks coach  Rick Carlisle  played  Jae Crowder  more than 12 minutes in the second half, and the second-year forward's energy and 11 points on 4-for-5 shooting played a critical role in Dallas' second-half surge.  
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "You see how it energized our team. ... We were just trying to bring a little energy, and it happened on the offensive end tonight, and it worked out for us." 
 --  Jae Crowder 
 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Rockets were repeatedly burned by the Mavericks in transition, failing to match up properly and limit the production of Dallas' perimeter shooters. Houston's inability to rotate and defend the 3-point line properly led to a number of great looks from long distance for the Mavericks, who finished 11-for-22 (50.0 percent) from downtown.  
 
 NOTABLE:  The Rockets played without leading scorer Harden, who sat out for the second straight game with a right high-ankle sprain. Houston also remains without the services of reserve big men  Omer Asik  (right thigh contusion) and  Greg Smith  (right knee sprain). ... In a move to match up with the brawny 6-foot-11 Howard, Carlisle started  Samuel Dalembert  at center. The 6-foot-7  DeJuan Blair , who had started nine of the last 10 contests, never entered the game. ... The Mavericks'  Vince Carter  became the 10th player in NBA history to connect on 1,700 3-point attempts when he buried a trey with 9:26 remaining in the second quarter. After draining two of three attempts from behind the arc Monday, Carter sits 18 3-pointers shy of passing  Dale Ellis  (1,719) for ninth all-time. ... Dallas has yet to suffer a three-game losing streak this season. ... Houston fell to 1-8 this season when trailing after three quarters and 2-8 when its opponent connects on more 3-point attempts ... The Rockets have poured in at least 60 points in the paint in three of their last four games.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks: Thursday vs. San Antonio, Saturday @ Chicago, Monday @ Minnesota. For the Rockets: Wednesday @ San Antonio, Thursday vs. Memphis, Saturday vs. New Orleans.
