 THE FACTS: Shawn Marion  and the Dallas Mavericks sprinted past the sluggish Memphis Grizzlies for a stunning 104-83 victory Saturday night at the American Airlines Center. Marion scored a season-high 20 points as the Mavericks (15-23) snapped their four-game home losing streak and halted a four-game winning streak by the Grizzlies (24-11). 
 Dallas finished 11-for-17 from 3-point distance and outscored Memphis 21-2 in fastbreak points through the first three quarters. Every Mavericks starter scored in double figures.  Dirk Nowitzki  had 17,  Chris Kaman  had 14,  O.J. Mayo  scored 11 against his former team and  Darren Collison  chipped in 10 points, six assists and four steals. Reserve  Elton Brand  added 10 points and nine rebounds. 
 The Grizzlies, coming off an overtime win last night in Memphis against San Antonio, trailed by as many as 34 points and were held to 38.1 percent shooting.  Rudy Gay  was the only Memphis starter in double figures with 12 points, while Dallas native  Darrell Arthur  tallied 11 points and a team-high nine boards off the bench. 
 Memphis had held 32 of its last 33 opponents under 100 points. The exception was a 121-96 loss at Houston on Dec. 22, also the second night of a back-to-back. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Our energy for most of the game was good. It was clear that they were lacking some energy from their game last night -- overtime, emotional, all of those things. We needed to take advantage of that and we did." 
 
 -- Dallas head coach  Rick Carlisle 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Mavericks only committed nine turnovers, matching a season low. That snapped the Grizzlies' streak at 138 consecutive games of forcing 10 or more turnovers, by far the longest streak in the NBA. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Dallas pulled away in the second quarter by shooting 58.8 percent (10-for-17) from the field and 4-for-5 behind the arc, getting 3-pointers from Marion, Nowitzki,  Vince Carter  and rookie  Jae Crowder  and taking a 54-39 lead into the locker room. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We just didn't have it tonight. We didn't have maybe one, maybe one-and-a-half starter that could bring it. Our focus and concentration wasn't there." 
 
 -- Memphis head coach  Lionel Hollins 
 
 
 HOT:  Nowitzki was 3-for-3 from 3-point range. Mayo was 2-for-2 and Marion went 2-for-3. 
 
 NOT:  Nowitzki was just 4-for-7 at the free-throw line and is shooting 72.2 percent (26-for-36) this season after missing the first 27 games following knee surgery. Most players would be happy with that, but not Nowitzki. The 11-time All-Star finished in the top 10 in the league in free-throw shooting in nine of the past 10 seasons and has cleared 90 percent in three of the last seven campaigns. ...  Zach Randolph  had season lows in points (six) and rebounds (four). 
 
 NOTABLE:  It was the Mavericks' first win at home since Dec. 18 against Philadelphia. They play four of their next five at the AAC. ... Dallas is 13-5 when shooting at least 45 percent from the field. ... The Mavericks' 34-point lead at 102-68 was their largest at any point this season. ... The Grizzlies scored the fewest first-half points by any Dallas opponent this season (39). ... Memphis had won four straight on the road. ... The Grizzlies grabbed 14 offensive rebounds, but turned them into just eight second-chance points. ... Dallas is 28-6 all-time at home against Memphis. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Monday vs. Minnesota, Wednesday vs. Houston, Friday vs. Oklahoma City. For the Grizzlies, Monday vs. L.A. Clippers, Wednesday @
