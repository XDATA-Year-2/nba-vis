  Notebook: Suns 86, Grizzlies 84   By Jerry Brown, for NBA.com Posted Sunday January 29, 2012 12:51AM THE FACTS:  Usually a 36-percent shooting night spells doom for the Phoenix Suns. But in this unique season where bad shooting nights are becoming the norm, the Suns found a way gut out a win a night after an embarrassing loss. Phoenix held Memphis to just 32 points in the first half and led by 16 at halftime, but gave it all back in the second half. It needed 21 points from  Steve Nash , 20 points and four free throws in the final 29.3 second by  Jared Dudley  and a one final defensive stand to grind out an 86-84 win over the Grizzlies. "We had to gut it out there at the end," said Nash, who took a  Marc Gasol  knee to his left quad on the final play of the game -- an off-balance 3-pointer by  Mike Conley  that fell short of the mark -- and left the court limping. "After last night's embarrassment, we came out with a lot of heart and found a way. I like winning, so it's nice to win in whatever fashion." Memphis was a perfect 7-0 against under .500 teams this season before falling to the 7-13 Suns. After a seven-game winning streak, the Grizzlies have now lost three straight on the road and go home looking to regroup. "They got to the free throw line [early in the fourth quarter]. We fouled them and couldn't stop them," Memphis coach  Lionel Hollins  said. "We had a couple of fouls early ... they were in the bonus early and made their free throws when they got to the line." FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:   Marcin Gortat  had a double-double for the 10th time in the last 11 games, collecting 13 points and 12 rebounds in 44 minutes despite a 6-for-17 shooting night. Gortat is now averaging double-digit rebounds for the first time in his career (10.1 per game). QUOTABLE:  "I was so tired I almost fell asleep during the National Anthem. I don't remember it being this tough during the [work stoppage] in 1998-99. Of course, I was a little younger then."    --  Grant Hill , who at 39 years old played 35 minutes on the second of back-to-back games and helped hold  Rudy Gay  to 18 points. THE STAT:  For just the second time in the last four years, the Suns won a game in which they shot less than 40 percent from the field (36.4 percent). Since the start of the 2004-05 season (when Nash rejoined the team), the Sun have won six times when shooting less than 40 percent in a game. TURNING POINT:  After the Grizzlies had carved a 16-point Phoenix lead to one with 3:24 left, the Suns had a ragged possession before Nash found Hill for a 3-pointer as the shot clock expired to restore the Phoenix lead to 82-78. HOT:  The Suns hit all eight of their free throws in the fourth quarter, including four in the last 29.3 seconds by Dudley. The Suns, who shot 50 percent (9-for-18) in Portland Friday, were 9-for-16 in the first three quarters Saturday. NOT:  Suns forward  Channing Frye  was given the start for the first time since Jan. 17, but it didn't get him started. Frye was 1-for-9 from the field, 0-for-3 from 3-point range and contributed just two points and three rebounds in 14 minutes NOTABLE:  Nash finished with six assists on Saturday and now has 6,511 assists as a Sun, leaving him seven assists behind  Kevin Johnson 's franchise record of 6,518. Nash also played his 700th game in a Phoenix uniform, joining  Alvan Adams  (988) and  Walter Davis  (766) as the only Suns to do so. STAT II:  The Suns are 4-1 when Dudley scores at least 15 points and 3-11 when he doesn't. Also returning to the starting lineup for the first time since Jan. 17, he had a season-high 20 points against Memphis including the game-winning free throws with 3.3 second left. QUOTABLE II:  "We had our chances. There's no such thing as moral victories. We just have to figure out how to get it done down the stretch. It could have gone either way on this trip. We had a sense of urgency in the second half, but we can't dig ourselves a hole like that."    -- Memphis guard  Tony Allen . UP NEXT:  For the Grizzlies, Monday vs. San Antonio, Tuesday vs. Denver and Thursday @ New Orleans. For the Suns, Monday vs. Dallas, Wednesday @ New Orleans and Friday @ Houston.
