
 Trail Blazers-Lakers notebook   By Bryan Chu, for NBA.com Posted Monday November 8, 2010 12:54AM THE FACTS:  What was expected to be their biggest test thus far this season became another rout for the back-to-back champions as the Lakers crushed the Blazers 121-96 Sunday at Staples Center. The Lakers (7-0) are now just one of two teams with an undefeated record (the Hornets, 6-0, are the other). This is the second time in three seasons that Los Angeles has won its first seven games to begin the season. The quickest start for the Lakers was 11-0 during the 1997-98 season. Once again, the Lakers featured balanced scoring with seven players in double figures. Lakers center  Pau Gasol  had a stat-stuffing triple-double: 20 points, 10 assists and a season-high 14 rebounds.  Lamar Odom  added a game-high 21 points on 10-for-15 shooting and snagged 12 rebounds. Portland (5-3) was led by  Andre Miller , who had a season-high 20 points, and  Nicolas Batum , 17.  Brandon Roy  and  LaMarcus Aldridge  combined for 16 points on 4-for-15 shooting. QUOTABLE:  "Intelligence. Toughness. Unselfishness. We have all three. We have size, everybody can make plays. Normally teams have one or two guys who can be playmakers. (But on our team) everybody can make plays for everybody else."   --  Kobe Bryant  on indications of what makes a great team THE STAT:  29 -- Largest lead by the Lakers in the game. TURNING POINT:  The two teams traded baskets in the first three minutes of play before the Lakers outscored the Blazers 22-8 to close out the quarter. The highlight that summed up the period was Odom snagging a defense rebound and then taking it himself coast-to-cast for a finger roll. No Blazer picked up Odom on his way to the hoop. QUOTABLE II:  "They have a lot of depth. They're a team you can't go out there and play with low energy or they're going kill you. There's no secret that they're stacked."   -- Roy on facing the Lakers HOT:  Gasol's triple-double (20-14-10) was his fourth career triple-double and first since Feb. 17, 2009. It took Gasol just 33 minutes to pencil in his eye-popping line. "Pau is a monster," Roy said. "He almost had a triple-double by halftime." NOT:  Roy, Portland's leading scorer, had just eight points on 1-for-6 from the field in 31 minutes of play. It wasn't until the 5:22 mark of the third quarter that Roy made his first field goal of the game. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Portland's Batum, who had 17 points in 29 minutes, has been hot in his last three contests. He has averaged 17.8 points on 21-for-43 shooting. He has made eight 3-pointers and four steals during that span. More importantly, he has averaged 37 minutes of playing time. NOTABLE:  Bryant scored 12 points in 26 minutes, but more importantly, he sat out the entire fourth quarter. ... With the Lakers continuing to blow out their opponents,  Shannon Brown , who had 15 points, has seen extended minutes and he has made the most of it, scoring double figures in four of his first seven games. ... Blazers coach  Nate McMillian  and Andre Miller each picked up a technical within 27 seconds of each other in the third quarter. ...The Blazers, who were playing the second of a back-to-back, trailed 58-36 at halftime. Their 36 points were a season low. ... The Lakers shot 54.9 percent to the Blazers' 42.7 and outrebounded Portland 49-25. UP NEXT:  For the Lakers, Tuesday vs. Minnesota, Thursday @ Denver, Sunday vs. Phoenix. For the Blazers, Tuesday vs. Detroit, Friday @ Oklahoma City, Saturday @ New Orleans.
