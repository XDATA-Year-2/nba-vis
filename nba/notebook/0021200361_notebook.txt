 THE FACTS:   Brandon Jennings  scored a season-high 34 points, including 13 in the decisive fourth quarter, as the Milwaukee Bucks fought off the Indiana Pacers for a 98-93 victory Tuesday night at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. 
 
 Monta Ellis  added 19 points and  Mike Dunleavy  had 17 points, six rebounds and two blocked shots in his return from a bone bruise in his knee that caused him to miss seven games. The Bucks (13-10) won for the fifth time in six games. 
 
 George Hill  led the Pacers (13-12) with 18 points, and  Paul George  had 16 points and 10 rebounds, but Indiana had a three-game winning streak snapped. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We knew that was going to be big for us. We let them get a lot of offensive rebounds in the first half and they were able to score off that. We knew that coming down the stretch, every rebound counted and we locked in there and boxed our men out." 
 -- Bucks center  Larry Sanders  on his team winning the rebound battle over the final five minutes after getting crushed the first 43. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Pacers finished with a 51-37 edge on the boards, but over the final five minutes, beginning with the game tied at 85, the Bucks won the rebound fight, 8-3.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  Jennings snapped an 85-85 tie with a jumper from the left wing and then added two free throws on the next possession after being fouled on a 3-pointer. After a dunk by  Paul George , Jennings hit a step-back 3-pointer for a 92-87 lead, and the Pacers were never closer than three the rest of the way. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Just trying to do whatever you can to scrap out a win." 
 -- Dunleavy on his two blocked shots and two huge rebounds down the stretch . 
 
 
 HOT:  Jennings made 13-of -22 shots after entering the game shooting just 40.1 percent. 
 
 NOT:  Not one of the Indiana starters managed to shoot 50 percent, with  George Hill  going 6-for-16,  David West  5-for-14 and  Paul George  6-for-15. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Jennings filled out his line nicely, adding six assists and five rebounds to his 34 points.  
 
 GOOD MOVE:  When centers  Ekpe Udoh  and Sanders both picked up their fifth fouls in the first 3:08 of the fourth quarter, Bucks coach  Scott Skiles  turned to barely used veteran  Drew Gooden , who turned in a solid 4:01 before Sanders was able to return and finish the game. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:   Ben Hansbrough  had seven points and three assists in 12 minutes for the Pacers.  
 
 NOTABLE:  Bucks rookie  Doron Lamb  missed the only two shots he took and is now 3 for his last 26 field goal attempts. ... Bucks center  Joel Przybilla  missed the game serving a one-game suspension for throwing a ball that hit a referee in Saturday night's loss to the Clippers. ... Bucks center  Samuel Dalembert  may be in Skiles' doghouse. The veteran center did not play despite Sanders and Udoh picking up their fifth fouls and Przybilla being unavailable because of a one-game suspension. ... The Pacers shot 68.8 percent (11 for 16) in the first quarter but just 32.8 percent (21 of 64) over the final three quarters. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Pacers, Wednesday vs. Utah, Friday @ Cleveland, Saturday @ New Orleans. For the Bucks, Wednesday @ Memphis, Friday @ Boston, Saturday vs. Cleveland.
