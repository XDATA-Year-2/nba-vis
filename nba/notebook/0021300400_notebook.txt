 THE FACT:  The Suns set a new season high for points scored, along with matching their season-best mark for 3s in a game (15). 
 THE LEAD: To beat the Phoenix Suns, a team has to keep their NBA-leading fast break in check. Then, they have to slow down the Suns' 3-point game. Doing both at once is tough, as the visiting Dallas Mavericks found out Saturday night in the Suns' 123-108 win -- the Suns' most lopsided victory this season. 
 The Suns (16-10) rained down a thunderstorm of 3-pointers, hitting 15-for-30, and have now hit at least seven 3-pointers in 18 straight games -- a franchise best. On Saturday, they hit seven (of 10) in the first quarter alone. 
 
 Eric Bledsoe  led the Suns with 25 points on just 12 shots, including 3-for-4 from long range. He also had six assists.  Gerald Green  scored 22.  Channing Frye  had 18 points and eight boards.  Dirk Nowitzki  was 7-for-17 shooting for 21 points.  Brandan Wright  and  Monta Ellis  both scored 19 apiece for the Mavs (15-12). 
 The Suns have won seven of their past eight. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Offensively, that was probably our best game."  
 -- Suns coach  Jeff Hornacek 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Suns' 123 points was the most for them in 112 games (125 vs. Portland on April 16, 2012). 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Green hit a trio of 3-pointers late in the first quarter as the Suns opened a lead that reached 15 twice (33-18 and 36-21). The Mavericks battled back time and again, but never got close than three points the rest of the way. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "They are legit. They are every bit as good as their record. You don't...beat Denver and wipe out a 21-point lead at Denver...if you are not good."  
 -- Mavericks coach  Rick Carlisle  on the Suns 
 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "Teams are trying to load up on me and  Goran [Dragic] . My teammates are making shots. I got the easy part. I just pass them the ball."  
 -- Eric Bledsoe 
 
 
 HOT:  The Suns, who have struggled at the free-throw line this year, knocked down 20-for-22 versus the Mavs. 
 
 NOT:  The Mavs shot just 3-for-17 from 3-point range. 
 
 IN THE ARENA:  Even the fans got in the 3-point act. One Suns' fan won $7,777 dollars by hitting a 3-pointer from up top at halftime. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  The Suns'  Archie Goodwin  scored six in 9:30 on 2-for-4 shooting. The Mavs'  Shane Larkin  had zero points and two assists in 14 minutes.  
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Green who had been in a slump, has hit 12-for-22 (including 10-for-20 on 3-pointers) the past two games for 41 points. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Suns are 8-5 against teams who were .500 or above through Friday...The Suns are 74-64 all time vs. the Mavericks....The Suns won their 16th game last year on Jan. 30 in their 46th game...That Dragic is the key to forcing the Suns' fast pace has been clear pretty much all season, but never more so than during his full-court mad dash to the Suns' hoop at the end of the first half. According to the official stat sheet, Wright scored on a dunk 3.9 seconds left in the half. Dragic answered on a fast-break layup with 1.9 seconds left, a 2.0- second full-court break.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Monday @ Houston, Wednesday vs. Spurs and Friday @ Chicago. For the Suns, Monday vs Lakers, Friday @ Golden State and Saturday vs. 76ers.
