  Notebook: Bucks 92, Raptors 86 Posted Monday April 23, 2012 11:50PM By Rick Braun, for NBA.com THE FACTS: Brandon Jennings  scored 25 points and  Ersan Ilyasova  added 19 points and 15 rebounds to lead the Milwaukee Bucks to a 92-86 victory over the Toronto Raptors Monday night at the Bradley Center. Despite the victory, the Bucks (31-33) saw their playoff hopes end when the Philadelphia 76ers defeated the New Jersey Nets earlier in the night. James Johnson  led the Raptors (22-43) with 22 points and 13 rebounds, but Toronto lost its fourth straight. QUOTABLE:  "Really? Is that what it was, 8 for 30? It's just energy and just a will to defend."  --  Bucks forward/center  Ekpe Udoh , who keyed a defensive effort that held Toronto to 8-for-30 shooting over the final 19 1/2 minutes. THE STATS:  Although the Bucks were outrebounded (49-43) and outshot (44.2 percent to 37.2 percent), Milwaukee won because it killed the Raptors in ball security (22-11 in turnovers) and at the free throw line (28-for-36 for the Bucks, to 14-for-18 for Toronto). TURNING POINT:  The Raptors were having their way in the first 28 minutes, and a 13-4 run to open the third quarter had given them a 61-47 lead with 7:48 left in the third quarter. At that point, forward Udoh entered the game for Milwaukee to provide some energy and inside defense. The Raptors were 26-for-46 at that point, but went 8-for-30 the rest of the way as Udoh had two of his three blocked shots and altered numerous other attempts inside. QUOTABLE II:  "Look at our record against the top six teams in each conference, and it's not good. We just couldn't break through ... and every couple weeks beat one of those teams. We just weren't able to do it."  --  Bucks head coach  Scott Skiles  on his team's inability to record big wins as proved by a 5-22 record (3-17 in the East) against the top six teams in each conference. HOT:  In a game where both teams shot under 45 percent, second-year guard  Gary Forbes'  6-for-9 night qualifies as hot. NOT:  Bucks center  Drew Gooden  was 1-for-7, and on a night where he wasn't helping on the defensive end that meant he played just 12 minutes and 41 seconds. INSIDE THE ARENA:  The Bucks honored the football and men's basketball teams of the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, which both won NCAA Division III national championships. GOOD MOVE:  With his team a sieve at the defensive end, Skiles called a timeout and sent in Udoh with 7:47 left in the third quarter. The Raptors scored just 25 points over the final 19 1/2 minutes. BAD MOVE:  Toronto's  DeMar DeRozan  was called for traveling with 3:58 left in the second period, then threw the ball to the other end of the court and into the stands, earning a one-technical ejection from referee  Mark Davis . ROOKIE WATCH:  Bucks first-round pick  Tobias Harris  played the entire second quarter and had four points. NOTABLE:  The Bucks were without three players from their rotation as forwards  Carlos Delfino  (groin) and  Luc Richard Mbah a Moute  (knee) were injured and  Larry Sanders  was serving the second game of a two-game suspension. ... The Bucks are 9-29 in games against teams currently above .500 this season and 22-4 against teams currently below .500. UP NEXT:  For the Raptors, Thursday vs. New Jersey. For the Bucks, Wednesday vs. Philadelphia, Thursday @ Boston.
