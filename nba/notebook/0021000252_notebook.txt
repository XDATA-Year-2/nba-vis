  Rockets-Mavericks notebook   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Monday November 29, 2010 11:52PM THE FACTS:  A balanced offense, a determined defense and an injury-depleted opponent added up to an easy 101-91 victory for the Dallas Mavericks on Monday against the visiting Houston Rockets. It was the sixth straight win for Dallas, fueled by double-doubles from  Dirk Nowitzki  (20 points, 10 rebounds) and  Shawn Marion  (14 points, 10 boards), an explosive third quarter by  Caron Butler  and 11 assists from  Jason Kidd .  Kevin Martin  led the Rockets with 17 points. QUOTABLE:  "Everybody is coming into their own a little bit right now and we're really supporting each other and we're holding each other accountable when we need to. We're playing as a complete team right now and we're competing at a high level."    -- Dallas forward Shawn Marion THE STAT:  Dallas is now 9-0 when five or more players score in double figures. Nowitzki (20 points), Butler (19), Marion (14),  J.J. Barea  (11, all in the first half) and  DeShawn Stevenson  (10) shared the workload. TURNING POINT:  A seven-point halftime lead swelled to 18 when Butler scored 11 consecutive points for the Mavericks in the third quarter, capped by a 3-pointer at the 3:55 mark that gave Dallas a 77-59 advantage. Butler scored 13 in the quarter on 6-for-7 shooting. Kidd assisted on four of those buckets and had eight of his 11 dimes in the period. QUOTABLE II:  "We didn't do a good job containing penetration. Barea came in and really hurt us, getting to the middle. Butler, the shots he took,  Shane [Battier]  was right on him. But once they get it rolling, that's a good team. They get him [Butler] going and Nowitzki going, it's tough to contain them."   -- Rockets head coach Rick Adelman HOT:  Marion has scored in double figures in four straight games while shooting a combined 55.8 percent (24-for-43) from the field. Dallas is 7-1 this season when "The Matrix" scores 10 or more points. NOT:  Houston dropped to 0-5 this season on the road against Western Conference teams. The Rockets came in averaging 104.4 points, but shot just 35.8 percent from the field. They shot 25.0 percent (6-for-24) in the second quarter and 28.6 percent (6-for-21) in the fourth. Martin was 3-for-6 from 3-point range, but just 1-for-9 inside the arc. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Coming off an 18-point, six-rebound effort in Sunday's loss to Oklahoma City, Battier managed just three points (1-for-5 shooting), zero boards and two blocks in 22-plus minutes for the Rockets. ROOKIE WATCH:  Mavericks guard  Dominique Jones  saw his first action in two weeks, going back to the Nov. 15 win against New Orleans. He played eight minutes and finished with two points and three turnovers. NOTABLE:  After making only 19 3-pointers in 64 games last season with the Wizards and Mavericks, Stevenson has already drained 19 in just 14 games in 2010-11. He was 2-for-4 against the Rockets and is shooting 50 percent from behind the arc. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Wednesday vs. Minnesota, Friday @ Utah, Saturday @ Sacramento. For the Rockets, Wednesday vs. L.A. Lakers, Friday @ Memphis, Saturday @ Chicago.
