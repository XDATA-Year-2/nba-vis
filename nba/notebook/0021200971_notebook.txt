 THE FACTS:    Kobe Bryant  started but couldn't finish, but it mattered little to the Los Angeles Lakers. Despite a scoreless 12 minutes from Bryant, the Lakers rode a combined 35 points and 9-for-14 shooting from the 3-point line from reserves  Steve Blake  and  Antawn Jamison , 20 points from  Dwight Howard  and 19 from  Metta World Peace  to a 99-93 victory over the Pacers Friday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. Producing just their third road win against a team with a winning record, the Lakers (35-32) recorded their 15th win in 21 games. They also pushed one full game ahead of Utah in the race for the final playoff berth in the Western Conference. Indiana (40-25) was led by  George Hill  with 27 and  Paul George  with 20 but shot just 37.4 percent. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We played hard and we played very well defensively. I thought  Steve Blake  and Metta on the defensive end were unbelievable. And Antawn was huge and Dwight was huge the whole game, able to stay out of foul trouble." 
  -- Lakers Coach  Mike D'Antoni  
 
 
 THE STAT:   Bryant did not score for the 15th time in his career, the first time since March 5, 2004, when he played just one minute in Seattle. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The teams traded the lead five times and were tied thrice in the fourth quarter, with Hill's jumper tying it at 87-all with 2:38 remaining. While Indiana came up empty on its next three possessions, Howard converted a three-point play and Jamison followed with a 3-pointer and a free throw to push the L.A. lead to 94-87 with 43.7 seconds left.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Really stiff, continued to swell, couldn't put weight on it so I called it a night. ... I just couldn't move, it's as simple as that. I just couldn't put any pressure on it." 
 -- Bryant on his sprained left ankle. 
 
 
 HOT:  Jamison shot 6-for-10 overall, 4-for-7 from the arc, adding seven rebounds, while Blake shot 5-for-8 overall, 5-for-7 from the arc, adding seven rebounds and six assists. Howard added 12 rebounds and four blocks and made shot 6-for-11 from the free-throw line. Indiana's Hill shot 11-for-19 overall and scored 20 of his 27 in the second half.  
 
 NOT:   Besides Hill, Indiana's other four starters combined to shoot 18-for-57 (.316). ... Indiana's bench was outscored 37-19 as the reserves combined to shoot 8-for-23 (.348). ... Bryant was 0-for-4 and his backup,  Jodie Meeks , was 0-for-7. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "Definitely, it was our best win of the season. It's been an up and down year, not to our fans' liking as far as our record is concerned. But I would say it's our best win of the season." 
 -- World Peace 
 
 
 NOTABLE:   Bryant was originally listed as "out indefinitely" after sustaining a severe ankle sprain in Wednesday's loss in Atlanta, but recovered enough to start the game. He did not return after playing the full first quarter. ... The Lakers shot 3-for-17 to start the game but were 30-for-61 (.492) thereafter . ... This was the Lakers' third road win of the season against a team with a winning record. ... Indiana jumped out to a 19-8 start but the Lakers answered with a 31-9 run, holding the Pacers to 4-for-25 shooting in a span of more than 12 minutes, while taking a 39-28 lead late in the second quarter. ...  Roy Hibbert  made his first 3-pointer since the 2009-10 season in the third period, improving his career mark to 4-for-15. ... Jamison picked up a Type 1 Flagrant Foul for pulling  Sam Young  down from behind in transition with 10:21 left in the game. ... After winning 20 of their first 23 home games, the Pacers have gone 6-5 in their last 11. ...  Lance Stephenson  had the second double-double of his career with 12 points and 11 rebounds, the latter tying a career high. ... The game had a delay of several minutes at the end of the first half as officials twice went to instant replay reviews to determine possible timing errors in the final two seconds. ... Indiana's  Danny Grange r missed his fifth consecutive game and 60th of the season due to a chronic left knee condition. He will miss at least one more game before being re-evaluated.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Pacers, Saturday at Philadelphia, Monday at Cleveland, Tuesday vs. Orlando. For the Lakers, Sunday vs. Sacramento, Monday at Phoenix, Friday at Phoenix.
