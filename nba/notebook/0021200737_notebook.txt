 THE FACTS : In all three meetings this season, the Indiana Pacers' hopes against Toronto came down to one last shot. For the second time in a row,  Paul George  missed and the Raptors escaped, this time 100-98 in overtime Friday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse.  Rudy Gay  shook off a cold start to score 17 of his 23 points in the fourth quarter and overtime to rally the Raptors to their second victory in four games since acquiring the shooting guard in a trade with Memphis. Indiana (31-20) blew a four-point lead with 10.7 seconds left in regulation as  Amir Johnson  scored twice inside, the second a buzzer-beater that sent the game to overtime at 90-all. Indiana led 97-96 with 2:05 left in overtime but would not make another bucket. Gay's jumper with 1.7 seconds remaining put Toronto up 100-98, and George's twisting 17-foot floater bounced in and out at the buzzer.  David West  scored a game-high 30 to lead Indiana, but committed costly turnovers late in regulation and overtime. George had 26 points, 14 rebounds, and five assists.  DeMar DeRozan  scored 22 for the Raptors (18-32). The loss snapped winning streaks of five overall and 15 at home for the Pacers. Two of Indiana's four home losses have come to the Raptors. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Rudy went for the layup and I was able to get the rebound and tip it in. Then he got back and got the steal on the inbounds pass and then got it to me. I was looking to get it back to him but he had fallen down. As soon as I missed the first shot I glanced at the game clock and saw that it said point-three so I just threw it back up."  --  Johnson on his two late buckets in regulation. 
 
 
 THE STAT:   In three games matched up against George, the first two with Memphis, Gay has shot 19 of 64 (.297) overall, missing all six of his 3-point attempts, and totaled 48 points (16.0). 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Indiana took a 72-64 lead into the fourth quarter but missed its next nine shots as Gay sparked a 10-0 Toronto run with six consecutive points, including a jumper that put the visitors up 74-72. It remained close the rest of the way but Indiana lost a chance to win it in regulation. Up 90-86 with 10.7 seconds left, the Pacers yielded a tip-in to Johnson with 6.2 seconds left. Needing only to get the ball inbounds, West attempted a long lead pass to  Lance Stephenson  that Gay intercepted, feeding the ball in to Johnson, whose lay-in just beat the buzzer.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "In the end, our guys hung in there. No one said this process was going to be easy. ... We're building something here with Rudy Gay."  --  Toronto coach  Dwane Casey. 
 
 
 HOT:  West hit 11 of 20 shots and pulled eight rebounds in his fourth 30-point game of the season but tied his season high with five turnovers.  Andrea Bargnani  (7 of 10) and  Jonas Valanciunas  (6 of 10) combined for 28 points as Toronto's bench enjoyed a 37-16 advantage over the Indiana reserves. Johnson made seven of his 12 shots and produced 14 points and 14 rebounds. 
 
 NOT:  Gay (9 of 25) and DeRozan (7 of 17) both had high volume but low efficiency for the Raptors. George missed 11 of his 19 shots. Indiana missed nine free throws. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "We just didn't make some smart plays. We lost an assignment on the initial basket (and) I was just careless with the ball. We just weren't able to close the game the right way."  --  West. 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Raptors had advantages of 22-15 on points off turnovers and 26-17 on second-chance points. ... Playing four games in five nights, George averaged 42.7 minutes. ... When the teams met on Oct. 31, George Hill hit a runner in the lane to give Indiana a 90-88 win. ... George missed a potential game-winning 3-pointer on Nov. 13 as Toronto escaped 74-72. ... Indiana is 2-2 in overtime, while Toronto is 2-5. ... Hill failed to score in double figures (nine) for the first time in 15 games. ... Both teams wore special shooting shirts emblazoned with a dragon as part of the NBA's week-long tribute to the Chinese New Year. ...  Sam Young  (ill) sat out for Indiana, while the Raptors were without  Landry Fields  (back spasms) and  Linas Kleiza  (sore right knee).
