 THE FACT:   Lance Stephenson  had 13 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists, falling just short of his fourth triple-double of the season for Indiana. 
 
 THE LEAD:   Indiana's offense may be struggling but there's nothing wrong with the defense as the Pacers held the Toronto Raptors to 37 percent shooting and a season-low point total in an 86-79 victory Tuesday before 16,147 at Bankers Life Fieldhouse.  
 
 Roy Hibbert  continued his dominance of Toronto, scoring 22 points with eight rebounds and three blocked shots for the Pacers (28-6). Hibbert, who has averaged 19 points on .587 shooting his last four games against the Raptors (16-17), was the biggest threat a struggling Indiana offense could muster but proved to be just enough. The Pacers failed to reach 90 points for the third time in four games after falling short just once in the first 30.  DeMar DeRozan  scored a game-high 28 for the Raptors, adding six assists, while  Patrick Patterson  had a season-high 20 off the bench. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "That's a really good win against a team playing as well as anybody in the NBA, with a bunch of quality road wins, but our guys really buckled down and defensively."  
 -- Indiana coach  Frank Vogel 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Aside from DeRozan, Patterson and  Kyle Lowry  (16 points), who combined for 64 points and 24-for-49 shooting, the rest of the Raptors totaled just 15 on 6-for-32 shooting. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Leading 44-36 after a back-and-forth first half, the Pacers asserted themselves in the third period, putting together an eight-point run to push the lead to 58-43 midway through the period, and a 9-2 burst late to make it 71-54. The Raptors were able to make it a six-point game three times in the final three minutes but could get no closer. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We're not shooting the ball that well from the perimeter, a little out of synch, a little out of rhythm. Just one of those points in the season."  
 --  Frank Vogel  on Indiana's struggling offense 
 
 
 HOT:  DeRozan scored 17 consecutive Toronto points in the third period. ... Patterson shot 8-for-14 and Lowry 7-for-13. ...  Danny Grange r played a season-high 30 minutes and scored 13 points with six rebounds for the Pacers. 
 
 NOT: Paul George  continued his recent slump, battling foul trouble and finishing with 11 points on 4-for-12 shooting. In the last five games, George has averaged 16.8 points, shot .354 overall and .194 from the 3-point line. ... Indiana was 1-for-11 from the 3-point line, while Toronto was 5-for-19. ... The Raptors' starting frontcourt of  Jonas Valanciunas  and  Amir Johnson  combined for four points and 1-for-11 shooting. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "Shooters' legs, sea legs, whatever you want to call it, it was there. We can have all the excuses but in a game like this, you've got to man-up and bring it."  
 -- Toronto coach  Dwane Casey 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Granger has scored in double figures in five consecutive games, averaging 11.8 points on .465 shooting. .... DeRozan entered the game averaging 11.0 points on .307 shooting in seven previous trips to Indianapolis, but busted that trend. ... Indiana is 26-3 when Hibbert plays at least 26 minutes, 2-3 when he does not. ...Toronto is 10-5 since trading  Rudy Gay  to Sacramento on Dec. 8, the third-best record in the Eastern Conference behind Miami (12-3) and Indiana (10-4) in that span. ... Both teams had travel problems due to Monday's winter storm that dumped a foot of snow on Indianapolis, prompting city-wide road, school and business closings. The Pacers were stuck in Cleveland after winning there Sunday night and did not return to Indianapolis until Monday evening. The Raptors remained in Miami after losing Sunday night, catching a flight to Indianapolis Tuesday morning and arriving mid-afternoon. ...  Tyler Hansbrough  missed a third consecutive game for the Raptors with a sprained left ankle. 
 
 UP NEXT:   For the Pacers, Wednesday at Atlanta, Friday vs. Washington, Wednesday vs. Sacramento. For the Raptors, Wednesday vs. Detroit, Saturday vs. Brooklyn, Monday vs. Milwaukee.
