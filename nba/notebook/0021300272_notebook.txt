 THE FACT: Brandon Jennings  shook off a poor shooting night in his return to the Bradley Center as he and the Detroit Pistons beat his old team, the Milwaukee Bucks, for the second time in 10 days. 
 
 THE LEAD: Andre Drummond  and  Greg Monroe  dominated inside to lead the Detroit Pistons to a 105-98 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks Wednesday night at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. 
 Drummond finished with 24 points and 19 rebounds, and Monroe added 18 points and 17 rebounds as the Pistons (9-10) won on the road for the second time in two nights and their third straight game overall. 
 
 Ersan Ilyasova  tallied 22 points and 10 rebounds for the Bucks (3-15), who have lost 13 of their last 14 games. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I was a little nervous at the beginning, because I'm not used to being on this side. There were a lot of emotions going on. But once the second half started I was able to settle down and just play basketball." 
 
 -- Brandon Jennings on his first game in Milwaukee with the Pistons after four seasons with the Bucks 
 
 
 THE STAT : Drummonds' 19 rebounds equaled the total of the entire Milwaukee starting five, as the Pistons won the board battle, 55-43. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  After a  John Henson  breakaway dunk gave Milwaukee a 54-48 lead with 10:15 left in the third quarter, the Pistons went on a 16-0 run, with Monroe scoring half of the points, for a 64-54 lead. The Bucks never got closer than five the rest of the way.  
 
 QUOTABLE II : "I didn't curse or anything like that. I just didn't like in the first minute for them to get a layup." 
 
 -- Pistons coach  Maurice Cheeks  on the timeout he called with 10:14 left in the third quarter following Henson's dunk 
 
 
 HOT:  Drummond made 8-for-13 from the field. Even more important, he made 8-for-14 from the free-throw line. He entered the game shooting 32.2 percent (19-for-59) from the line. 
 
 NOT:  Although he finished with 17 points and 11 assists, Jennings went just 4-for-16 from the floor and had six turnovers. He's shooting just 38.2 percent (97-for-254) for the season. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Drummond added three blocks and two steals to his 24 points and 19 rebounds.  
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Timeouts rarely work as well as the one Cheeks called with 10:14 left in the third quarter. The Pistons went on a 16-0 run afterward. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Bucks first-round pick  Giannis Antetokounmpo  had a solid line of six points, six rebounds, four assists and three blocked shots in 27 ½ minutes. Pistons first-round pick  Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  had eight points and three rebounds in just under 28 minutes. More important, Caldwell-Pope held  O.J. Mayo , Milwaukee's leading scorer, to just seven points -- none until 7:12 left in the fourth quarter. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Both teams played in other cities on Tuesday night and didn't arrive in Milwaukee in the early morning hours. Both teams had to land in Chicago because of fog and bus to Milwaukee. The Pistons got into Milwaukee around 3:30 a.m., and the Bucks arrived about 30 minutes earlier. ... The Bucks blocked eight shots in the second quarter and 13 for the game. ... Bucks forward  Ekpe Udoh  tied his career-high with six blocks. ... Drummond has now grabbed at least 10 rebounds in 15 of the Pistons' 19 games. He's averaging 12.9 per game, moving him up to second in the league. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Pistons, Saturday @ Chicago, Sunday vs. Miami, Tuesday vs. Minnesota. For the Bucks, Friday @ Washington, Saturday vs. Brooklyn, Tuesday @ Chicago.
