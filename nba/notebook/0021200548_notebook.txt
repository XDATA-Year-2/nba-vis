 THE FACTS:  The Miami Heat ended their two-game losing streak in blowout fashion, working over Sacramento Kings on their home floor with a final of 128-99. 
 
 Mario Chalmers  shot the lights out from the perimeter, finishing with a career-high 34 points on 12-for-16 shooting, including an incredible 10 3-pointers.   LeBron James  put on an aerial show, scoring 20 points while handing out seven assists.   Chris Bosh  added 16 points in the Heat win. 
 
 Isaiah Thomas  went on the offensive for the Kings, setting a new career high with 34 points on 13-for-22 shooting.   DeMarcus Cousins  anchored the Kings post, scoring 11 points and grabbing eight rebounds, while rookie  Thomas Robinson  finished with a 10-point, 10-rebound double-double. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I had asked Spo to put me back in.  I knew what the record was and I just wanted to go in there and try and beat the record." 
 -- Mario Chalmers 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Heat shot 46 percent (17-for-37) from behind the arc and 56 percent overall in the 29-point win.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  This game was never close enough to have a turning point.  The Heat mauled the Kings in the first few minutes of the game and never looked back. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Rio had it going man and we kept finding him." 
 -- LeBron James on Chalmers 
 
 
 HOT:  The Kings sagged off Chalmers in the first half and he killed the Kings, scoring 19 of his 34 points on 5-for-7 shooting from 3-point land.     
 
 HOT II:  Thomas brought his jump shot tonight.  The second-year guard out of Washington scored a career-high 34 points, including an 21 in the third quarter.  
 
 NOT: Tyreke Evans  struggled in his 26 minutes of action, finishing with eight points on 2-for-9 shooting.  
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Heat made their flight to Sacramento and the team bus arrived without incident.  That's about all it took tonight to beat the Kings.  
 
 NOTABLE:  Sacramento mayor  Kevin Johnson  sat courtside with his wife at Sleep Train Arena and was seen speaking to  Mark Mastrov , a potential new buyer for the Kings at halftime.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Heat, Monday @ Utah, Wednesday @ Golden State, Thursday @ L.A. Lakers. For the Kings, Monday vs. Cleveland, Wednesday vs. Washington, Friday @ Memphis.
