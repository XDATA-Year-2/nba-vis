 THE FACT: Al Jefferson  had 30 points and 16 rebounds and the Charlotte Bobcats finished the first half of their season with a 111-101 victory over the Orlando Magic. 
 
 THE LEAD:  The Bobcats (17-24) started and finished strongly, shooting 52.7 percent overall to win for only the third time in their last 12 games. 
 After erasing an early 18-point deficit, the Magic (10-30) lost their 10th straight in spite of 24 points by  Arron Afflalo . 
 All five Charlotte starters scored on a 21-3 game-opening run, but Orlando had the lead by halftime. 
 The Bobcats pulled away in the final nine minutes, mostly on the scoring of Jefferson and  Kemba Walker .  
 
 QUOTABLE : "This is the NBA. When I looked up and saw the score 19-2, I said: 'Oh boy!' because every good team is going to make a run. They made their run and had the lead at the half so we had to go back out there and get refocused on defense." --  Jefferson 
 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Seventeen or 19 in the first quarter in this league -- its nice to have but it's not all that big a deal really. You want to play from ahead on the road, but the way they played against Chicago (Wednesday night),  I knew it was going to be hard to keep 'em down." --  Bobcats coach  Steve Clifford 
 
 
 THE STAT : In 25 years in the NBA, the Magic have had seven losing streaks of 10 games or more. Three of them have come in the last season and a half. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Bobcats led by only four points early in the fourth quarter when the Magic ran out of gas on defense. Perhaps feeling the effects of Wednesday night's triple-overtime loss, they fouled repeatedly over a 5 1/2-minute stretch in which Charlotte got 16 of its 20 points at the foul line. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "I think tonight we did show poor body language throughout the fourth quarter, and it's tough because we weren't making that many shots and they were making some tough shots. And it is like human nature, but going forward we have to cut that out and we have to be locked in on our team and what we can control." --  Magic forward  Tobias Harris 
 
 
 HOT:  The Bobcats made nine of their first 12 shots, and 10 straight free throws in the fourth quarter. 
 
 NOT:  After lifting the Magic back into the game with a huge second quarter,  Victor Oladipo  missed all three of his field goal attempts in the second half. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  With the game on the line down the stretch, the Bobcats went inside to the 6-foot-10, 289-pound Jefferson, who delivered 12 points without missing a shot in the fourth quarter. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Down by six points with almost two minutes left and plenty of time on the shot clock, the Magic's  Jameer Nelson  forced a bad 3-point shot that missed badly. 
 
 IN THE ARENA: Horace Grant , who played in 411 games for the Magic from 1994 to 2002, was honored as part of the team's 25th anniversary celebration. Now living in California, the 48-year-old Grant said he is still an avid NBA fan. "I go crazy. I watch all the games, from Magic, the Bulls, the Lakers, the Heat," he said. "There's a couple teams that I can't watch just because there's no fundamentals."  
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Jefferson had a monster game with 13-for-17 shooting and three steals. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Oladipo (11 points, 10 assists) and former Indiana University teammate  Cody Zeller  of the Bobcats (six points, three rebounds in 12 minutes) were the only rookies in the game. 
 
 NOTABLE : The Magic are 0-12 this season without center  Nikola Vucevic , who missed a sixth straight game after suffering a concussion . . . The Bobcats are 9-2 when they score at least 100 points . . . The Magic are 1-22 when giving up 100 or more. This was Orlando's 10th consecutive loss, its third double-digit losing streak in last 13 months...Charlotte notched its eighth road win of the season, after recording only six all last season...Jefferson tallied his 15th double-double of the season, and his first 30-15 game...Walker is averaging 24.8 ppg and 7.0 apg in last four games. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Bobcats: Saturday vs. Miami, Monday vs. Toronto, Wednesday vs. L.A. Clippers. For the Magic: Sunday vs. Boston, Tuesday @ Brooklyn,  Wednesday vs. Atlanta.
