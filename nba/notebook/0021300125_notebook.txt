 THE FACT:  Not only is Indiana off to the fastest start in franchise history at 9-0, the best in the league since Dallas opened the 2002-03 season with 14 wins, the Pacers have matched their longest winning streak ever in the NBA. 
 
 THE LEAD:  One game after  Lance Stephenson  had his first career triple-double,  Roy Hibbert  very nearly had his second, posting 24 points, 10 rebounds and eight blocked shots to lead Indiana to its ninth straight victory, 104-77, over visiting Milwaukee Friday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse.  Paul George  scored 17 of his 22 in the second half for the Pacers, who shot .506 overall. The short-handed Bucks (2-6) lost their fourth straight and were led by O.J. Mayo's 20 points. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Our probability of winning a game should be 100 percent when Roy is playing at that level." 
 -- George 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Hibbert was scoreless with one rebound the last time he squared off against  Zaza Pachulia , who had 17 points and 14 rebounds with Atlanta in the Dec. 29, 2012 matchup. This time, Hibbert turned the tables as Pachulia managed just four points on 2-for-14 shooting.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  Milwaukee scored the first nine points of the second half to cut Indiana's lead to 52-46 but George and Hibbert took over from there, combining for 18 of the Pacers' next 19 points as they pushed the advantage back to 71-55. Milwaukee closed to 79-68 early in the fourth but George scored seven in a 15-2 run that blew it open. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Last time I played against him I had a doughnut, one or two rebounds, something like that. I told myself I was going to push myself to have a productive game." 
 -- Hibbert on his matchup with Pachulia. 
 
 
 HOT:  Indiana's starters outscored their Milwaukee counterparts 73-45 and now hold a 141-point advantage on the season, an average of 15.7 per game. ... Hibbert shot 8-for-10 and hit all eight of his free throws. ... George shot 8-for-13 in the second half. 
 
 NOT:  Milwaukee's  Gary Neal  shot 1-for-7 inside the 3-point line. ... Milwaukee's starters combined to shoot 19-for-58 (.328). ... Indiana point guard  George Hill  shot 4-for-13. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "When you talk about dealing with adversity, it can do one of two things to you: it can really defeat you or it can take your take to another level from the standpoint of teaching these guys how to deal with adversity very early in a season. We've done that and the thing I won't allow to happen, I won't allow the guys to get down because of what our situation has been from an injury standpoint. This is something we have to deal with. We're all professionals, all teams go through different adversities, whether it's injuries or whatever. We have to learn how to deal with it, we have to learn how to handle it and we have to move on from it. At some point, we'll get our guys back and we'll really get a chance to see what we have." 
 -- Bucks coach  Larry Drew 
 
 
 NOTABLE:   Indiana lost the third quarter for the first time this season, 24-23. Even so, the Pacers have outscored opponents by 69 in the period. ... Milwaukee used its seventh starting lineup in eight games. ... Indiana exceeded 100 points for the first time this season. ...  Luke Ridnour  made his season debut for the Bucks after missing the first seven games with back spasms and had four points and one assist in 21 minutes. ... Pachulia (foot) and Neal (foot) returned after missing one game. ... Bucks forward  Caron Butler , who injured his left shoulder against Orlando, traveled to Los Angeles to see a specialist. There is no timetable for his return. ... the Bucks also were without  Brandon Knight  (right hamstring),  Carlos Delfino  (right foot),  Ersan Ilyasova  (right ankle) and  Larry Sanders  (right thumb). ... Indiana's longest winning streak ever was 11 during the 1972-73 ABA season. 
 
 UP NEXT:   For the Pacers, Saturday at Chicago, Wednesday at New York, Friday at Boston. For the Bucks, Saturday vs. Oklahoma City, Wednesday vs. Portland, Friday at Philadelphia.
