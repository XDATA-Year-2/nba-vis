
 Sixers-Thunder notebook   By Randy Renner, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday November 10, 2010 11:51PM THE FACTS: Kevin Durant  and  Russell Westbrook  over-powered the Philadelphia 76ers, scoring 62 points between them, to lead the Oklahoma City Thunder to a 109-103 win. Durant and Westbrook each popped the Sixers for 31 points. Westbrook also dished out 12 assists. Philadelphia was led by  Elton Brand ,  Jrue Holiday  and  Jodie Meeks  with 17 apiece. QUOTABLE:  "We've got to be better in crucial situations but it's not like we got beat by bad players tonight, Durant and Westbrook won gold medals this summer. They're great. We just have to get better."   --76ers coach  Doug Collins THE STAT:  Thunder All-Star Durant was just 1-for-5 on 3-pointers, but he hit six of his 13 other shots and was perfect at the line, going 16-for-16. TURNING POINT:  Oklahoma City led just 53-51 when Philadelphia's Brand was taken out of the game in favor of  Thaddeus Young  with 1:31 left in the second quarter. The Thunder then went on a 6-0 run to close the first half and the Sixers could get no closer than three the rest of the way. QUOTABLE II:  "It's nice to finally hit some shots. Our offense was good at times tonight. Kevin's shots didn't always fall tonight but he attacked the rim and got to the free throw line. That's what we need him to do."   --Thunder coach  Scott Brooks HOT:  Oklahoma City came into the game hitting a league-best 85.9 percent from the free throw line. In the first half OKC was even better, 95.5 percent on 21-for-22 at the line. The Thunder finished at 94.6 percent, 35-for-37. NOT:  Philly sixth man  Lou Williams  was just 1-for-6 in the first half for three points. He was just 2-for-11 for six points when he left the game late in the third quarter with a left shoulder injury. GOOD MOVE:  OKC's Westbrook saw guard  James Harden  breaking toward the basket early in the fourth quarter and launched a perfect alley-oop lob that Harden jammed home and sent the sell-out crowd into a frenzy. BAD MOVE:  Westbrook had a wide-open chance at a layup or a dunk late in the second quarter. Instead, he turned down the easy shot while sailing past the rim and attempted an over-the-shoulder reverse layup. It missed. ROOKIE WATCH:  Guard  Evan Turner  started for the Sixers. He played 38:53, scoring 15 points and grabbing eight rebounds. Thunder center  Cole Aldrich  got into the game in the first quarter and played 9:04. He pulled down two rebounds and blocked one shot. NOTABLE:  Oklahoma City is now 3-0 against Eastern Conference opponents this season after going 22-8 in 2009-10. Philadelphia is now 0-4 this season when an opponent scores 100+ points. UP NEXT:  For the 76ers, Friday @ Dallas, Saturday @ San Antonio, Tuesday @ Cleveland. For the Thunder, Friday vs Trail Blazers, Sunday vs Spurs, Monday @ Utah.
