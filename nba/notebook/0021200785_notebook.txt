 THE FACTS : Some things haven't changed.  Vince Carter  can still fill up the stat sheet and the Sacramento Kings still can't win in Dallas. Carter caught fire with five 3-pointers in the third quarter, passed  Larry Bird  on the all-time scoring list and led the Dallas Mavericks with 26 points off the bench in Wednesday's 123-100 victory over the Sacramento Kings at the American Airlines Center. 
 It was the 18th consecutive loss for the Kings in Dallas. That's the longest home winning streak ever by the Mavericks (23-29) against any opponent, and the second-longest active streak in the NBA behind San Antonio's 28-game run against Golden State. Sacramento (19-35) last won in Dallas in February 2003 and has rarely made it close, losing by an average margin of 15.3 points. 
 The 36-year-old Carter (21,796 career points) scored 17 in the third quarter and passed Bird (21,791) for 29th place in NBA history with a 3-pointer with 2.9 seconds left in the period. The eight-time All-Star and former Rookie of the Year, playing in his 15th season, also became just the 11th player with 1,600 made 3-point field goals (1,602). He was 6-for-9 from 3-point distance. 
 
 Tyreke Evans  scored 23 points and  DeMarcus Cousins  had 17 points and 13 rebounds for the Kings.  Jason Thompson  also added 17 points and  James Johnson  contributed 16 points, six boards and four assists after getting no playing time in the previous three games.  Darren Collison  had 18 points and nine assists while  Dirk Nowitzki  tallied 17 points, eight rebounds, six assists and three steals for Dallas. It was the last game before the All-Star break for both teams. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "If it was tonight, it would have been great." 
 -- Vince Carter on whether he should try to enter the All-Star Weekend's 3-Point Shootout. 
 
 THE STAT : The Kings are 1-17 on the road when trailing after the first quarter. The Mavericks are 12-0 at home when leading after one. 
 
 TURNING POINT : After Sacramento sliced an 18-point deficit down to seven with five minutes left in the third quarter, Carter took over with a vintage "Vinsanity" performance. He knocked down back-to-back 3-pointers at the 4:38 and 4:08 marks, then swished three more treys in the final 1:08 to bury the Kings. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "Obviously Vince Carter [got] hot and made a bunch of plays and 3-point shots. Then it started raining. Once you start making 3s, everyone starts making them. You can't compensate or catch up with 2s or missed layups." 
 -- Kings coach  Keith Smart 
 
 
 HOT : After missing its first six 3-point shots and going 3-for-13 in the first half, Dallas shot 47.6 percent (10-for-21) from behind the arc in the second half. ... The Mavericks were 24-for-26 at the free-throw line. 
 
 NOT : The Kings shot 25 percent (4-for-16) from deep. ...  Jimmer Fredette  was just 1-for-7 from the field off the Sacramento bench. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA : Carter, a former North Carolina Tar Heel, asked the media members on press row for score updates from the North Carolina-Duke game during the second half. 
 
 NOTABLE : Kings guard  Marcus Thornton  (bruised right hand) and Mavericks center  Chris Kaman  (concussion) were inactive. ... Sacramento wore its retro purple-and-black, checkered-side jerseys from the 1996-97 and 1997-98 seasons. ... Nowitzki passed  Mark Aguirre  (1,259) for second place in Dallas history in offensive rebounds behind  James Donaldson  (1,296). ... The Mavericks improved to 20-8 when shooting at least 45 percent. ... The Kings have dropped six straight road games. ...  Isaiah Thomas  has made 35 consecutive free throws over his last seven games. ... Dallas is 11-2 at home against teams playing the second night of a back-to-back. ... Next up for Carter is  Gary Payton  in 28th place on the NBA all-time list with 21,813 points. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Mavericks, Feb. 20 vs. Orlando, Feb. 22 @ New Orleans, Feb. 24 vs. Los Angeles Lakers. For the Kings, Tuesday vs. San Antonio, Feb. 22 @ Atlanta, Feb. 24 @ New Orleans.
