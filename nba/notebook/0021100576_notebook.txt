  Notebook: Thunder 115, Suns 104 Posted Thursday March 8, 2012 12:03AM By Randy Renner, NBA.com THE FACTS:  The Oklahoma City Thunder roared back from a 16-point deficit behind 30-point nights from  Kevin Durant ,  Russell Westbrook  and  James Harden  plus a 20-rebound effort from  Serge Ibaka  to stun the Phoenix Suns 115-104 inside a raucous Chesapeake Energy Arena. It is just the second time in NBA history three players scored at least 30 points and a fourth grabbed 20 rebounds. Westbrook led the way with 31 and also handed out 10 assists. Durant ended with 30 points, six rebounds, three assists, three steals and two blocks. Harden's 30 points are a career high, and he did it on just 12 shots. Ibaka's 20 rebounds are also a career high. The Suns were led by 28 points from  Marcin Gortat , who had vowed before the game to better his 12-point output from the last time these teams played. He also grabbed 11 rebounds.  Jared Dudley  had 17 points and 11 rebounds and  Steve Nash  added 12 points and 13 assists. The Thunder clamped down on defense in the second half allowing the Suns to shoot only 34.3 percent and 0-for-11 on 3-pointers. It was even worse in the critical fourth quarter for Phoenix as the Suns could manage only 17.6 percent (3-for-17) and 0-for-8 from downtown. QUOTABLE:  "That fourth quarter defense was another great performance. We did a much better job (on defense) in the second half. We weren't getting back in the first half but we did in the second."    -- Thunder coach Scott Brooks THE STAT:  In the fourth quarter OKC outscored the Suns 31-16. The Thunder shot 50 percent while holding Phoenix to 17.6 percent. Durant and Westbrook scored 21 of those 31 points on 7-for-12 shooting. Gortat was 1-for-5 in the second half after going 8-for-14 in the first. Nash had 0 assists in the second half after dishing 13 in the first. TURNING POINT:  The Thunder trailed by 12 points, 84-72, when Westbrook was whistled for a technical foul. That seemed to light a fire that led to a 26-7 run. At about the same time Brooks went to a small lineup for scoring punch. QUOTABLE II:  " Royal (Ivey)  had a big impact when we went small. You look at his stat line, 17 minutes, no points, no rebounds, no assists but he sparked us on defense. He would not get screened, he got on the floor for loose balls. We really got ourselves involved defensively when we went small."   -- Brooks QUOTABLE III:  "We probably could have weathered the 30 points from Durant but we can't do 30 from another guy. I thought we played great for three quarters and then we struggled offensively in the fourth. You gotta be able to do it for 48 minutes."   -- Suns coach  Alvin Gentry HOT:  Nash had five assists in the first six minutes of the game and 13 at halftime ... The Suns were 9-for-14 (64.3 percent) in the first eight minutes ... Gortat was 5-for-10 (12 points) in the first quarter and 3-for-4 in the second ... The Suns shot 53.1 percent (26-for-49) at halftime ... Harden was 5-for-8 (17 points) at halftime ... Westbrook was 5-for-6 (14 points) in the second half. NOT:  Oklahoma City was just 7-for-21 (33.3 percent) and 0-for-6 on 3-pointers in the first 10 minutes ... OKC was 2-for-12 (16.7 percent) from long range in the first half ... The Phoenix bench was 1-for-8 in the second half. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Supermodel  Kate Upton  sat courtside with members of the Thunder ownership group. She was part of another sellout crowd inside Chesapeake Energy Arena. GOOD MOVE:  In the third quarter Russell Westbrook was called for an offensive foul then got a technical when he complained to official  Scott Foster . Westbrook, still clearly upset, stole the ball from Nash on the following possession, raced down court and hit a slam. GOOD MOVE TOO:  In the fourth quarter Brooks went to a small lineup, using three guards, Durant playing power forward and Ibaka at center. The Thunder outscored Phoenix 25-10 with that lineup in the first eight and a half minutes of the final quarter. NOTABLE:  The only other game where three players scored at least 30 points and a fourth had at least 20 rebounds was on November 18, 1969 when  Mike Davis  (40 points),  Gus Johnson  (30 points),  Earl Monroe  (30 points) and Wes Unseld (23 rebounds) did it for the Baltimore Bullets ... Oklahoma City has now won 14 consecutive games at home and is now 17-1 at home this season. UP NEXT:  For the Suns, Thursday vs. Dallas, Saturday vs. Memphis, Monday vs. Minnesota. For the Thunder, Friday vs. Cleveland, Saturday vs. Charlotte, Tuesday vs. Houston.
