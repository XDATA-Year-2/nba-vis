
 Blazers-Bucks notebook   By Rick Braun, for NBA.com Posted Tuesday November 2, 2010 11:32PM THE FACTS:   Wesley Matthews  returned to the home court of his college days lead all scorers with 18 points and spark a big defensive effort as he helped the Portland Trail Blazers to a 90-76 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks at the Bradley Center. QUOTABLE:  "I'm not sure how much was me, I'm not sure how much was him missing shots. It was a team effort. He came out hot. He's a good player and can shoot the ball well. He plays with a lot of confidence."   -- Matthews, who entered with 6:34 left in the first quarter and shut down Bucks forward  Carlos Delfino , who had scored 11 points in the first 5:14 of the game. THE STAT:  Bucks shooting guard  John Salmons  made just 2-for-14 shots (five points), and point guard  Brandon Jennings  went 2-for-7 (eight points), giving Milwaukee's starting backcourt a 4-for-21 (19 percent) night. Add in sixth-man  Corey Maggette 's 4-for-12 and the total is 8-for-33 (24.2 percent) for three players the Bucks are counting on heavily for scoring. TURNING POINT:  Delfino scored 11 points on 4-for-5 shooting -- including two 3-pointers -- in the opening 5:14 of the game, helping the Bucks to a 16-4 lead. At that point, Matthews entered the game and covered Delfino, who made just one more shot the rest of the night and finished with 14. The Bucks were 6-for-9 from the field when Matthews entered, but made just 21-for-63 (33.3 percent) the rest of the night. Maggette (16) and  Andrew Bogut  (12) were the only other Bucks in double figures. HOT:  After starting the game 1-for-9, the Trail Blazers made 16 of their next 24 shots to take their first lead of the night at 40-39 on a  Brandon Roy  jumper with 4:22 left in the half. NOT:  Salmons went 2-for-14 Tuesday night and has yet to shoot 50 percent in a game. In four games he's 11-for-43 (25.6 percent). He shot 46.7 percent in 30 games after joining the Bucks in a February trade last season. GOOD MOVE:  After Delfino went off for 11 points in the first 5:14 of the game, Portland coach  Nate McMillan  called on Matthews off the bench and had him guard Delfino. The Bucks forward only took three more shots on the night, making one of them. ROOKIE WATCH:  Portland guard  Armon Johnson  went 4-for-4, including two 3-pointers, to finish with 10 points and five assists in 22 minutes. "He did a good job of running the team and finding guys," McMillan said. "Creating offense and getting the ball to the open man, and then when he had his opportunity to score he took the shot. Just a solid effort. Tonight he earned the right to play more minutes." NOTABLE:  The Bucks played a game of diminishing returns, scoring 27 point in the first quarter, 18 in the second, 17 in the third and 14 in the fourth. Their 31 second-half points were a season low for a half, and their 27 field goals and 76 points were also season-lows. UP NEXT:  For the Blazers, Thursday vs. Oklahoma City, Saturday vs. Toronto, Sunday @ Los Angeles Lakers. For the Bucks, Wednesday @ Boston, Friday @ Indiana, Saturday vs. New Orleans.
