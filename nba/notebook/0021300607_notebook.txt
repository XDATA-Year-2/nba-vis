 THE FACT:  Detroit is 17-24 at the midpoint of the season. The Pistons have not been over .500 at the midway point since they were 24-17 during 2008-09, the last time they made the playoffs.  
 
 THE LEAD:  Sixth man  Jamal Crawford  had 26 points and power forward  Blake Griffin  powered for 25 to lift the Los Angeles Clippers to a 112-103 win over the Detroit Pistons on Monday at The Palace of Auburn Hills. Guard  J.J. Redick  added 20 points and a season-high six assists for the Clippers (29-14) and center  DeAndre Jordan  collected 16 points and 21 rebounds. The Clippers have won six of their last seven games despite the absence of injured All-Star  Chris Paul . Reserve guard  Rodney Stuckey  had a season-high 29 points and forward  Josh Smith  contributed 24 -- his fourth game in the last five with at least 20 points -- but the Pistons (17-24) lost for the seventh time in their last eight home games.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We lean on our system and our coaching staff keeps us prepared. We lean on each other, we trust each other. It's only getting better as the season progresses and when Chris comes back, hopefully we'll really take off." 
 --  Jamal Crawford  on the team's success without Paul, who has missed eight games with a separated right shoulder 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Seven -- Dunks by Jordan, who leads the NBA with 116. Griffin also went airborne for five first-half dunks as the Clippers took an 11-point halftime lead.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  Detroit was still within striking range at 67-61 with 8:48 remaining in the third. Los Angeles then went on a 16-6 run. Redick scored eight of those points, including two 3-pointers, and lobbed the ball to Jordan for a one-handed slam. 
 
 HOT:  Griffin is enjoying a career year and he's continuing to take more of the scoring load. He has reached the 25-point mark in nine of the last 15 games. He shot 9-for-16 from the field Monday and added seven free throws and five assists.  
 
 NOT:  Pistons point guard  Brandon Jennings  was held scoreless, missing seven field-goal attempts in 28 minutes. He entered the game leading the Pistons with a 16.4 point average. It was just the second time in Jennings' career that he has been blanked. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It was a good performance. It wasn't great. We relaxed too much at certain times there in the fourth quarter, especially. I thought we should have done a better job of putting it away but it was solid for a lot of guys and that's what we need." 
 --  Blake Griffin  on the Clippers' offensive performance 
 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Detroit guard  Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  had six points, two assists and three steals in 20 minutes. His playing time was limited because of Stuckey's outburst. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Clippers are 2-1 on their seven-game road trip. ... Los Angeles is 18-0 when the team makes nine or more 3-pointers. ... Pistons center  Andre Drummond  had 15 points and 11 rebounds, giving him his Eastern Conference-best 30th double-double. Jordan recorded his 20th double-double, a career high. ... Pistons reserve guard  Will Bynum  made his 1,000th career field goal late in the first quarter. ... Clippers forward  Matt Barnes  had 10 points and five rebounds in his first start of the season. ... The Clippers have won the last five meetings. ... Detroit was out-rebounded 44-30.
