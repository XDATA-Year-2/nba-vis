  Notebook: Mavericks 99, Kings 60   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Sunday January 15, 2012 12:25AM THE FACTS:  The defending champions defended the basket in record-breaking fashion Saturday, with Dallas delivering a thorough 99-60 thrashing to Sacramento. The Kings scored the fewest points and registered the lowest field-goal percentage (25.6 percent) by any opponent in 32 seasons of Mavericks basketball. The Kings also set a franchise record for futility with 23 first-half points and finished with their fewest points since a 101-59 loss to the Charlotte Hornets on Jan. 10, 1991. Jason Terry  scored a game-high 21 points for the Mavs, winners of five straight.  Vince Carter  added 16 points,  Dirk Nowitzki  had 14 and  Shawn Marion  tallied 10 points and eight rebounds. The Kings, who have lost 15 straight meetings at the American Airlines Center, got 14 points from  Marcus Thornton  and 12 points and 10 boards from  DeMarcus Cousins . QUOTABLE:  "They had some struggles and their shot-making wasn't great, but I thought we had something to do with that. We're placing our major emphasis on energy, defense and rebounding. The guys are responding."  --Mavericks head coach  Rick Carlisle THE STAT:  The previous records for fewest points and lowest shooting percentage by a Mavericks opponent were both set by the Timberwolves on Feb. 27, 2007. Minnesota shot 29.6 percent from the field en route to a 91-65 defeat. The Kings' previous low for a half was 25 points against the Boston Celtics on Feb. 26, 1957, when the franchise was still the Rochester Royals. Sacramento scored 11 in the first quarter and 12 in the second. TURNING POINT:  After the Kings bricked their first eight shots of the game, the outcome was never in doubt. The Mavericks led wire-to-wire for the second time this season (Jan. 10 at Detroit). QUOTABLE II:  "We use the term traveling training camp, because that's pretty much what this is. The guys are still trying to get up to speed on what I want to do and how I want to play."   -- Sacramento head coach  Keith Smart , who replaced  Paul Westphal  earlier this month. HOT:  This marked the 110th time that Dallas has played four games in five nights, but just the fourth time it won all four games. The Mavericks also completed the sweep in November 2010, November 2006 and February 1987. NOT:   Tyreke Evans  had scored 25-plus points in four of the Kings' previous five games, but mustered just three points on 1-for-8 shooting. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Back in the starting lineup after missing four games with back spasms, Dallas point guard  Jason Kidd  played 29 minutes and contributed a season-high six steals, six assists, five points and three rebounds. Kidd's layup in the first quarter was his first two-point field goal of the season. His first 12 buckets were all from 3-point range and he was 0-for-5 inside the arc in his first eight games. ROOKIE WATCH:  Sacramento guards  Jimmer Fredette  and  Isaiah Thomas  were a combined 2-for-14 from the field. NOTABLE:  Owner  Mark Cuban  said the Mavericks will receive their 2011 NBA championship rings at their Jan. 25 game vs. the Timberwolves. Former Dallas guard  J.J. Barea  plays for Minnesota. ... The Mavericks are 8-0 when holding opponents under 90 points and 0-5 when they allow 90-plus. ... Dallas had a 60-28 advantage in bench scoring. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Monday @ Los Angeles Lakers, Wednesday @ Los Angeles Clippers, Thursday @ Utah. For the Kings, Monday @ Minnesota, Wednesday vs. Indiana, Friday @ San Antonio.
