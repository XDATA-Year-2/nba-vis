 THE FACTS: Bradley Beal  scored 28 points, the highest total for a Washington player this season, and  Nene  added 21 points and 13 rebounds as the suddenly hot Wizards rolled to their fourth straight victory -- a 102-90 over the Milwaukee Bucks Monday night at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. 
 
 John Wall  added 14 points and 10 assists, and  Emeka Okafor  added 12 points and 10 rebounds for the Wizards (15-35), who have gone 11-7 in their last 18 after a 4-28 start. 
 
 Monta Ellis  led the Bucks (25-25) with 24 points, eight assists, seven rebounds and six steals. And other than  Ersan Ilyasova 's 19 points and nine rebounds, no other player was a factor for Milwaukee. The Bucks have lost four straight and six of their last seven. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "My teammates did a great job finding me. John [Wall] found me a few times,  A.J. [Price] , and Nene found me a few times as well. All my teammates did a great job of finding me, and I was just so happy to be open tonight." 
 -- Bradley Beal 
 
 THE STAT : After shooting 61.9 percent and scoring 32 points in the first quarter, the Bucks went just 7-for-30 (23.3 percent) in the second quarter and 23-for-74 (31.1 percent) over the final three quarters. 
 
 TURNING POINT : A 6-0 run pulled the Bucks within 81-78 with 8:52 left. The Wizards called a timeout and then worked the ball inside to Nene, whose three-point play started a 9-0 run that made it 90-78 and game-over. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "We got after him. After that first quarter, I thought we did settle down with our defensive scheme." 
 -- Wizards coach  Randy Wittman , whose team held  Brandon Jennings  to 3-for-17 shooting 
 
 HOT : Nene went 10-for-13 to lead an offensive effort that was well above 50 percent all night and finished 42-for-74 (56.8 percent). 
 
 NOT : Jennings is 21-for-75 (28 percent) over his past four games. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT : Ellis had something for just about every category with his 24 points, eight assists, seven rebounds and six steals. He even had a blocked shot.  
 
 QUOTABLE III : "We hate that the break's coming up. It's going to ruin our momentum. But it's an opportunity to get some rest, though, and then come back focused and with the same mentality." 
 -- Bradley Beal on the All-Star break arriving after Wednesday's games 
 
 GOOD MOVE : Wittman's timeout to set up Nene's 3-point play after the Bucks pulled within 81-78 worked just as every coach hopes such a timeout works. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH : Beal's 28 came in just his second game back after missing five games with a sore left wrist. Bucks forward  John Henson  posted four points and four rebounds, a block and a steal in 13:33 of playing time. 
 
 NOTABLE : The Bucks played their third straight game without center  Larry Sanders , who has a bruised back suffered in a fall at Denver last week. Sanders, who leads the league in blocked shots, said he would seek a second medical opinion for the slow-healing injury. The Bucks are 1-4 when Sanders misses the game. ... After an 8-3 start, the Bucks are now 9-9 since  Jim Boylan  took over as coach for  Scott Skiles . ... The Bucks are just 13-12 at home.  ... The Wizards improved to 4-21 on the road. Three of the victories have come since Wall returned after missing the first 33 games.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Wizards, Wednesday @ Detroit, Feb. 19 vs. Toronto, Feb. 22 vs. Denver. For the Bucks, Wednesday vs. Philadelphia, Feb. 19 @ Brooklyn, Feb. 20 vs. Brooklyn.
