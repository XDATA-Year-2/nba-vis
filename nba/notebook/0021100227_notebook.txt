  Notebook: Hawks 121, Cavaliers 94   By Matt Winkeljohn, for NBA.com Posted Saturday January 21, 2012 10:38PM THE FACTS:  Two teams entered Philips Arena Saturday upset after horrible losses a night earlier, and the Atlanta Hawks left the Cavaliers feeling that way after  Joe Johnson  scored 17 of his 25 points in the first half to lead Atlanta to a 121-94 rout. The Hawks closed the first quarter with an 13-3 run and never looked back on the way to beating Cleveland for the fifth straight time. Rookie point guard  Kyrie Irving  scored 18 points, but had seven turnovers as the Cavs followed the worst home loss in franchise history (114-75 Friday to the Bulls) with another poor defensive showing. Atlanta led the 76ers 47-39 at halftime Friday only to score 10 points in the third quarter of a 90-76 loss in Philadelphia, but the Hawks (12-5) suffered no prolonged droughts Saturday. They made 55.4 percent of their shots (46-for-83) and hit a season high in points. By quarter, they scored 27, 34, 28 and 32 points.  Joe Johnson  made 10-of-18 shots, and was 5-for-9 from beyond the 3-point line. Atlanta point guards  Jeff Teague  and  Jannero Pargo  added 14 points each (a season high for Pargo),  Zaza Pachulia  had 13 (to tie his season high), and 12 of 13 Hawks scored. Atlanta's sixth straight win at home left the Hawks 8-1 in Philips. The Cavs (6-9) have lost three straight. QUOTABLE:  "We let ourselves down [Friday] in the second half, and everybody knew it. We understood the importance of winning before we [go] out on a five-game road trip."   -- Atlanta's  Josh Smith THE STAT:  A couple jump out. Atlanta's 31 assists were one short of a season high, and the the Hawks' 31-10 assist-to-turnover ratio was superb, especially when juxtaposed against Cleveland's 18-18 ratio. The Hawks' 10 turnovers were one more than their season's best effort of nine. Atlanta also cranked up its transition game, out-scoring the Cavs 30-13 in fastbreak points. TURNING POINT:  Trailing 16-14 in the first quarter, the Hawks broke free for good from there when they turned up the pressure on defense. Atlanta forced Cleveland to miss six of seven shots over the final 4:58 of the period, and the Cavs turned the ball over four times in that span -- twice on shot clock violations. QUOTABLE II:  "Sometimes it takes hitting rock bottom to learn, but I don't think we're anywhere near rock bottom yet. Last year, we lost 26 in a row so hopefully we won't see that streak start again."   -- Cavs coach  Byron Scott . QUOTABLE III:  "I think right now we're worse than we were last year."   -- Cleveland's  Antawn Jamison HOT:  Scott said before the game that he would continue to limit Irving's minutes until he plays better defense, but the rookie from Duke continues to scorch it while on offense. After making 8-of-10 shots Saturday (in 27:01), he's made 29-of-50 -- including 5-for-10 from distance -- over the past five games. . . . Pachulia tied his season highs in points (13) and assists (four), and grabbed six rebounds while shooting 6-for-7. . . . Pargo's six assists were a season high. . . . Cleveland's Tristan Thompson tied his career high with 16 points on 6-for-7 shooting. NOT:  Smith had a game-high 11 rebounds and tied his season high with five assists, but he shot just 2-for-9 and has made but 7-of-24 over his past two games. NOTABLE:  Cleveland reserve guard  Daniel Gibson  missed the game for "personal reasons." . . . Pachulia started at center for Atlanta after  Jason Collins  started the previous three games in the wake of Al Horford suffering a torn pectoral muscle. . . .  Joe Johnson's  five 3-pointers represented a season high. UP NEXT:  For the Cavs, Tuesday @ Heat, Wednesday vs. Knicks, Friday vs. Nets. For the Hawks, Monday @ Bucks, Wednesday @ Spurs, Friday @ Pistons.
