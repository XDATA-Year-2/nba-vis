
 Nets-Heat notebook   By Shandel Richardson, for NBA.com Posted Saturday November 6, 2010 11:39PM THE FACTS:  The trio of  Dwyane Wade ,  LeBron James  and  Chris Bosh  combined for a season-high 73 points in the Miami Heat's 101-89 victory against the New Jersey Nets Saturday at AmericanAirlines Arena. QUOTABLE:  "It was important that we just didn't put it aside. We had to address it and watch that first quarter from last night to really remind ourselves not to take this process for granted."   -- Heat coach  Erik Spoelstra  said, referring to Friday's loss at New Orleans. THE STAT:  The Heat continued their third-quarter dominance, outscoring the Nets 32-17. TURNING POINT:  This happened the moment Bosh decided to be more aggressive. He played with passion, making the Heat look like a three-headed monster for the first time this season. HOT:  Wade was 10-for-17 from the field, leading the Heat in scoring for the second straight game with 29 points. NOT:  New Jersey's  Brook Lopez  and  Troy Murphy  combined to shoot 8-for-27. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  James continues to fill the stat sheets. He had 23 points, nine assists, three rebounds and two steals. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Game didn't generate buzz because of the opponent. No celebrity sightings. GOOD MOVE:  Spoelstra called out the team's rebounding before the game. The Heat responded by outrebounding New Jersey 44-41. BAD MOVE:  Nets forward  Terrence Williams  was called for a flagrant foul after pushing James on a fastbreak layup attempt. James landed in the first row of the stands. ROOKIE WATCH:  Nets center  Derrick Favors  scored 11 points and had five rebounds in 28 minutes. NOTABLE:  Wade recorded his 96th career double-double, pushing him past  Tim Hardaway  and into fourth place on the Heat's all-time list. UP NEXT:  For the Heat, Tuesday vs. Utah, Thursday vs. Boston, Saturday vs. Toronto. For the Nets, Tuesday vs. Cleveland, Wednesday @ Cleveland, Saturday vs. Orlando.
