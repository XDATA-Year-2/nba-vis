  Notebook: Blazers 137, Spurs 97 Posted Wednesday February 22, 2012 1:30AM By Kerry Eggers, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  Portland jumped on San Antonio early and never let off the gas in a 137-97 shellacking Tuesday night at the Rose Garden, ending the Spurs' 11-game win streak. The Blazers (18-16) used a 22-0 run to go in front 41-20 late in the first quarter, and the rout was on. LaMarcus Aldridge  led seven Blazers in double figures with 21 points, with  Jamal Crawford  (20),  Nicolas Batum  and  Gerald Wallace  (19 apiece) and rookie  Elliot Williams  close behind. San Antonio coach  Gregg Popovich  -- already missing injured  Manu Ginobili  -- chose to rest stars  Tony Parker  and  Tim Duncan  as the Spurs (23-10) were playing the eighth game of a nine-game road trip. Rookie forward  Kawhi Leonard  collected 24 points, 10 rebounds and five steals. It was San Antonio's most one-sided defeat since a 111-69 loss at Chicago in March 1997. QUOTABLE:  "When you want a win, you don't care who you're playing. [Going against their] JV, varsity -- it's still a win, right? We wanted it after last night. We wanted to come back from the loss we had, and we did it tonight."    -- LaMarcus Aldridge, referring to the Blazers' 103-92 loss to the Lakers at Staples Center Monday night. THE STAT:  Portland shot season bests from the field (.593) and 3-point range (.536), matching its season high with 15 made 3s. The Blazers had season highs for most points in a quarter (41, the first) a half (66, the first), through three quarters (103) and for a game. TURNING POINT:  The Spurs led 20-19 seven minutes into the game when the Blazers launched on a 22-point run. The visitors missed eight straight shots, and when the smoke cleared, Portland was in front 41-20. QUOTABLE II:  "Portland played great. [The Blazers] were aggressive and started the game on fire. They kept the intensity and force up the whole game. Our guys? They busted their [butts]. They did as well as they could."    -- Spurs coach Gregg Popovich. HOT:  Jamal Crawford and  Raymond Felton  combined to make 7-for-8 3-pointers in the first quarter -- and the miss was a desperation shot by Felton as the shot clock expired. Crawford was 4-for-4 and Felton 3-for-4. Portland wound up 15-for-28 (.536) from beyond the arc. NOT:  San Antonio shot .381 from the field. Take away Leonard's 9-for-14 and the Spurs were 23-for-70 (.328). QUOTABLE III:  "Sometimes that type of game can be a challenge. ... there can be a letdown. As I told our guys, 'It's not about who's out. We need to play the game.' I thought they did."    -- Portland coach  Nate McMillan . INSIDE THE ARENA:  LaMarcus Aldridge and Special Olympian  Jackie Buxton  -- who will represent Portland during All-Star Weekend in Orlando -- exchanged jerseys during a pregame center-court presentation. GOOD MOVE:  Portland coach Nate McMillan started Crawford in place of Felton at point guard. Crawford made 6-for-8 shots -- 5-for-7 from beyond the arc -- and dished out eight assists with one turnover in 30 minutes. Felton was 6-for-11 (4-for-8 on 3s) and contributed 16 points and four assists with one turnover in 24 minutes. BAD MOVE:  Leonard tried to save the ball under the Portland basket, throwing it right Aldridge. Only an intentional foul saved a dunk. NOTABLE:  Portland has dominated San Antonio since the 2008-09 season, winning 10 of 11 meetings. The Blazers have beaten the Spurs seven straight times at the Rose Garden. UP NEXT:  For the Blazers, Feb. 29 at Denver, March 1 vs. Miami, March 3 vs. Minnesota. For the Spurs, Tuesday at Denver, Feb. 29 at Chicago, March 2 vs. Charlotte.
