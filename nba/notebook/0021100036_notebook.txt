  Notebook: Bulls 108, Kings 98   By James Ham, for NBA.com Posted Friday December 30, 2011 1:10AM THE FACTS:  It wasn't pretty, but the Chicago Bulls used a late surge to pin a 10-point home loss on the Sacramento Kings, 108-98. QUOTABLE:  "To give all those layups is inexcusable. To blame officials or to blame teammates or blame coaches, that's not what's happening for winning teams and we're not going to have that."   -- Sacramento coach  Paul Westphal THE STAT:  Although  DeMarcus Cousins  had no problem getting both  Joakim Noah  and  Omer Asik  into foul trouble, he picked up his sixth and final foul with a little under five minutes remaining in the game. Cousins has totaled 15 personal fouls in the Kings first three games of the season. TURNING POINT:  Down eight with just over a minute to play in the third, the Bulls  C.J. Watson ,   a 6-foot-2 guard, tied up  J.J. Hickson , forcing a jump ball with the Kings 6-foot-9 power forward. Watson won the tip, the Bulls scored on the ensuing possession and extended their lead to 10. HOT:  The entire Bulls team. After shooting a whopping 41.5 percent from the field on Monday night at Golden State, the Bulls lit the Kings defense up, shooting an impressive 53.8 percent from the field. NOT:  Cousins. At first glance, a stat line that includes 15 points and 12 rebounds doesn't sound bad. Unfortunately, Cousins shot only 4-for-16 from the field and fouled out in just 28 minutes of play. NOTABLE:  Kings rookie  Jimmer Fredette  scored a career-high 14 points on 5-for-10 shooting in just over 24 minutes of play. UP NEXT:  For the Bulls, Friday @ Clippers, Sunday versus Memphis, Tuesday versus Atlanta. For the Kings, Saturday versus New York, Sunday versus New Orleans, Tuesday @ Memphis.
