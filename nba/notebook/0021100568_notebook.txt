  Notebook: Mavericks 95, Knicks 85 Posted Wednesday March 7, 2012 12:03AM By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com THE FACTS: Dirk Nowitzki  came to the Mavericks' rescue in a game that appeared headed for a blowout, scoring 24 of his 28 points in the second half -- 11 in the final five minutes -- to secure a 95-85 victory Tuesday against the Knicks in Dallas. The Mavericks were rolling in the third quarter, up by as many as 19, but New York didn't roll over. A 15-0 run to start the fourth quarter gave the Knicks a brief 78-77 lead. Nowitzki finally put Dallas on the board with a jumper at the 4:34 mark, touching off a decisive 14-0 run for the defending champs. Amar'e Stoudemire  had 26 points,  Jeremy Lin  tallied 14 points and seven assists and  Steve Novak  scored 13 points (4-for-8 3-pointers) for New York.  Rodrigue Beaubois  had 18 off the bench and  Jason Kidd  finished with 15 points and six assists for Dallas, which won for the 13th time in its last 15 home games against the Knicks. QUOTABLE:  "In this season, no lead is safe, no deficit is too large. We just see it time and time again. We've just got to keep playing, keep playing, keep playing. They made a heck of a run to take the lead. We made a heck of a run to put the game away."   -- Mavericks head coach  Rick Carlisle THE STAT:  Playing their fourth game in five nights, veterans Nowitzki (11) and Kidd (five) had enough in the tank to score the first 16 of the Mavericks' fourth-quarter points. TURNING POINT:  After Nowitzki gave Dallas the lead with 4:34 left, the Knicks sent him to the free-throw line on the Mavs' next two possessions. He went 4-for-4 and then Kidd drained a clutch 3-pointer after a missed jumper by Novak. QUOTABLE II:  "I thought our energy was great. We were getting up into people. We were turning them over a little bit. They missed some shots. Novak hit some threes. Guys got to the rim."   -- New York head coach  Mike D'Antoni  on the 15-0 run to open the fourth quarter. HOT:  Coming off a 1-for-8 effort in the first half, Nowitzki scored 13 in the third and 11 in the fourth. He was 7-for-10 from the field after intermission and finished 10-for-10 at the line. NOT:  For the Mavericks,  Lamar Odom  finished 1-for-9 and  Vince Carter  was 1-for-8.  Carmelo Anthony  was held to six points on 2-for-12 shooting for the Knicks. GOOD MOVE:  Dallas took advantage of the speed of Beaubois, often at the expense of veteran  Baron Davis . Beaubois scored 12 points in just 13 minutes in the first half. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Lin missed nine of his 13 field-goal attempts and was 5-for-8 at the line. He added three rebounds, two steals and two turnovers. INSIDE THE ARENA:  To a standing ovation, Knicks center  Tyson Chandler  received his 2011 NBA championship ring from Carlisle during a pregame ceremony. "Please help me welcome back a guy that will always go down as an all-time legendary Maverick player," the coach told the sold-out American Airlines Center crowd (20, 605). ... After the third quarter, a fan sank a halfcourt shot to win an 82-inch 3-D television. NOTABLE:  Monday's loss at Oklahoma City guaranteed that the Mavericks, in this abbreviated 66-game campaign, won't record at least 50 wins in the regular season for the first time since 1999-2000 (40-42). ... Dallas centers  Brendan Haywood  (left ankle sprain) and  Brandan Wright  (concussion) did not play. Haywood is day-to-day, but Wright will not travel on the upcoming road trip. ... Knicks forward  Jared Jeffries  left in the second quarter with a sore right knee and did not return. ... The Mavericks are 14-0 at home when leading entering the fourth quarter. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Thursday @ Phoenix, Friday @ Sacramento, Saturday @ Golden State. For the Knicks, Wednesday @ San Antonio, Friday @ Milwaukee, Sunday vs. Philadelphia.
