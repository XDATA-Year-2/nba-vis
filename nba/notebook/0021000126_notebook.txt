
 Sixers-Mavericks notebook   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Saturday November 13, 2010 12:00AM THE FACTS:  Reserve  J.J. Barea  paced a deep Dallas attack with a season-high 19 points in Friday's 99-90 victory against Philadelphia. Six players scored in double figures for the Mavericks, who won their third straight game and defeated the 76ers for the sixth straight time in Dallas.  Dirk Nowitzki  and  Shawn Marion  scored 16 each for the Mavs and  Thaddeus Young  led Philly with 17 off the bench. QUOTABLE:  "Our balance has been very good the last two games. It's something we talked about heading into the season that was part of defining who we are as an exceptional team."    -- Mavericks head coach Rick Carlisle. THE STAT:   11,000 : With his first assist of the game, an alley oop to  Tyson Chandler  for a two-handed slam at 9:51 of the first quarter, Mavericks point guard  Jason Kidd  recorded No. 11,000 for his career. The 16-year veteran ranks second in NBA history behind only Hall of Famer  John Stockton  (15,806). He finished with eight assists (11,007 career), 10 points and four steals. TURNING POINT : The Mavericks broke it open with a 10-0 run early in the fourth quarter. After  Tony Battie  hit a short jumper to trim Philadelphia's deficit to 78-77, the 76ers came away empty on their next six possessions. Barea made back-to-back driving layups and then dished to  Brian Cardinal  for a 3-pointer to cap the Dallas spurt. Philly shot 26.3 percent (5-for-19) in the quarter). QUOTABLE II:  "Their size killed us. At the end of the day, it was their size."    -- Philadelphia head coach  Doug Collins. HOT:  The center tandem of Chandler and  Brendan Haywood  helped Dallas win the battle of the boards, 47-42. Chandler (11 points, 12 rebounds) posted his second double-double in three games and Haywood grabbed a season-high 17 rebounds, nine on the offensive glass. He had 11 by halftime. NOT:  Philadelphia outscored Dallas 52-38 in the paint, but struggled just about everywhere else on the floor. The Sixers shot 12.5 percent (2-for-16) from 3-point range and 60.9 percent (14-for-23) at the free-throw line. Their starters missed all eight attempts from behind the arc. ROOKIE WATCH:  Making his third straight start for the 76ers, No. 2 overall draft pick  Evan Turner  finished with five points, six rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block in 28 minutes. NOTABLE:  The Mavericks, who led 78-75 entering the fourth quarter, improved to 6-1 this season when leading after three quarters. They were 44-3 in those games last season. UP NEXT:  For the 76ers, Saturday @ San Antonio, Tuesday @ Cleveland, Wednesday vs. Toronto. For the Mavericks, Monday vs. New Orleans, Wednesday @ New Orleans, Friday vs. Chicago.
