 THE FACTS:   Josh Smith  scored most of his season-high 31 points early and Will Bynum scored most of his season-high 31 late, yet it was  Jeff Teague  's nine points in the second overtime Wednesday that were key as the Hawks beat the Pistons 126-119 to avoid what would have been a disastrous loss. 
 The Hawks blew a 22-point fourth-quarter lead against the visiting Pistons -- who fell to 3-14 on the road -- and trailed in the first overtime before dropping Detroit for the ninth straight time in Philips Arena. 
 Smith scored all but one of his points in the first three quarters and Bynum came off the bench and started cooking as Smith cooled. The former Georgia Tech star scored 25 points after halftime. 
 Atlanta led 84-62 when  DeShawn Stevenson  hit a 3-pointer with 10:58 left in the fourth quarter, and 94-74 on Lou Williams' trey with 6:51 to go in the period.  
 But the Pistons outscored the Hawks 27-7 over the final 6:35 of regulation. Detroit shot 7-for-9 on 3-pointers in the fourth, when Bynum went 3-for-3 and Austin Daye 3-for-4.  
 Bynum was 3-for-13 from trey land before going 4-for-6 Wednesday.  
 Detroit took a 101-100 lead when he assisted on a 3-point shot by Daye with four seconds left in regulation.  
 The Hawks forced overtime when  Al Horford  made a free throw with 1.8 seconds left. He missed the second. 
 Detroit led 108-104 in the first overtime on a driving reverse layup by Bynum with 1:41 left, but the Hawks tied it on a short shot by Horford and two free throws by Teague after a Detroit shot clock violation. 
 Bynum missed two contested layups in the final minute of the first overtime, including one with 3.3 seconds left.  
 Horford had 22 points and 10 rebounds, Teague had 17 points and 11 assists after going scoreless in the first half, Smith added 10 rebounds, and reserve guard/forward  Anthony Morrow  scored 16 for Atlanta. 
 Drummond had 12 rebounds and Daye 11 as the Pistons outrebounded the Hawks 62-47. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We were playing cautious. We had the big lead, and we didn't want to lose the game . . . we took our foot off the pedal, and started to relax." 
 -- Teague, after his fourth double-double. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  8-for-8. The Hawks made all eight of their free throws in the second overtime, when the Pistons did not go to the line. Atlanta also made its first nine free throws in the game, but in between the two streaks the Hawks were just 6-for-14. In the fourth quarter and first overtime, Smith was 1-for-4 and Horford was 2-for-6 from the line. Neither attempted a free throw in the second overtime, when Teague was 4-for-4. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Pistons led 112-110 on Bynum's short jumper with 3:03 left in the second overtime, but the game turned once and for all moments later.  
 Shortly after Teague hit a 3-pointer at the other end for a 113-112 Atlanta lead as Bynum slid under a screen, Teague stole the ball from Bynum as he tried to dribble between his legs. Bynum committed a clear-path foul, and Teague made both free throws.  
 From there,  Rodney Stuckey  was guilty of an offensive foul, leading to a layup by Teague, and after a Bynum shot pulled the Pistons within 117-114, Teague fired to  Kyle Korver  for a 3-pointer. That shot -- after Korver had gone 1-for-10 previously -- gave Atlanta a 120-114 lead with 1:40 left in the second overtime. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I got hot, and other guys picked it up and piece by piece things started to work. The missed shots haunt me now, and they were still haunting me while I was out there." 
 -- Bynum. 
 
 
 HOT:  Bynum scored 15 points in the fourth quarter on 6-for-7 shooting, and Detroit shot 16-for-22 (72.7 percent) in the period while outscoring Atlanta 39-20. ... Smith went a little bananas in the first quarter, when he scored 14 points on 6-for-9 shooting and made two free throws. He added four rebounds and two steals in the period as well, while Atlanta rolled to a 28-13 lead. ...The Pistons' bench scored 26 points in the second quarter, when Detroit outscored Atlanta 32-22. The Pistons scored 20 points in the paint in the second, yet scored just two fastbreak points. ... Atlanta had a 16-2 edge in fastbreak points on the way to a 28-13 first-quarter lead.  
 
 NOT:  Smith missed all seven of his shots in the fourth quarter and overtime periods -- including two 3-pointers -- and was 1-for-4 from the free throw line in that time. . . . In between their two hot streaks from the free throw line, Atlanta was 6-for-14 as Smith went 1-for-4 and Horford 2-for-6 in the fourth quarter and the two overtimes. . . . Detroit starters  Jason Maxiell  and  Kyle Singler  each missed all three of their shots.  
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Pistons coach  Lawrence Frank  opted to stick almost exclusively with his subs in the fourth quarter and the two overtime periods, and with good reason. The Detroit bench was on the way to scoring an NBA-season-high 85 points. 
 Four Detroit subs scored in double figures (Bynum 31, Andre Drummond 16, Stuckey 16, and  Charlie Villanueva  14) on a night when Detroit's starters combined to score 34 points.  
 Forward  Tayshaun Prince , who was a game-time decision with a sprained ankle, was the only Detroit starter to play in the fourth quarter or either overtime period. He played just two seconds of the fourth quarter, 2:19 in the first overtime, and not at all in the second overtime.  
 
 ROOKIE REPORT:  Drummond was impressive in his sense of place in the paint. He not only had game highs of seven offensive rebounds and 12 overall rebounds, but shot 7-for-9 with two steals and a blocked shot. The 6-11, 285-pound forward/center had three turnovers in 36:02. ...Singler s being asked to play out of position at shooting guard for Detroit, and it showed Wednesday when he missed all three of his shots, was beaten off the dribble several times while on defense, and did not play after exiting with in the middle of the third quarter. . . .  
 
 NOTABLE:  Hawks guard  Devin Harris  missed his fourth straight game because of a sore left foot. ... Atlanta had a season-high 35 assists. ...  Lou Williams , in his second straight start after coming off the bench in the Hawks' first 24 games, added a season-high eight rebounds to his 18 points.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Pistons, Friday vs. Miami, Sunday vs. Milwaukee, Tuesday vs. Sacramento. For the Hawks, Friday @ Cleveland, Saturday vs. Indiana, Monday @ Houston.
