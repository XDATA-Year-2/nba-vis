  Notebook: Jazz 112, Blazers 91 Posted Thursday April 19, 2012 1:13AM By Kerry Eggers, for NBA.com THE FACTS: Devin Harris  scored 25 of his 27 points in the first half and Utah never trailed in its 112-91 win over Portland Wednesday night at the Rose Garden. Gordon Hayward  added 23 points and  Al Jefferson  had 11 points and 10 rebounds for the Jazz (33-30), who remained in the thick of the Western Conference playoff race with three games to play in the regular season. Wesley Matthews  scored 21 points for Portland (28-35), which played its final home game of the season. QUOTABLE:  "We're right in the mix. We just have to keep continuing to take care of business. We can't afford to watch and see what anybody else is doing. We have to make sure we win our games, and whatever happens from there, happens."    -- Utah coach  Tyrone Corbin , on the four-team race for the final two West playoff spots. THE STAT:  Utah was 10 for 17 from 3-point range, with Harris making 6 of 10 attempts. TURNING POINT:  Portland rallied from a 19-8 deficit to tie the score at 28-28 early in the second quarter. Utah responded with an 18-7 run for a 46-35 lead; the Blazers were never within single digits the rest of the way. HOT:  Harris was unconscious in the first half, sinking 8 of 12 shots from the field, 6 of 9 from 3-point range and 3 of 4 from the foul line. NOT:  Portland's  Nicolas Batum  made 1 of 6 shots from the field in the first half, then retired to the sideline due to a sore left knee. QUOTABLE II:  "I had a couple of those go in, and it just snowballed from there."   -- Harris INSIDE THE ARENA:  Seattle Seahawks coach  Pete Carroll  was watching courtside with  Paul Allen , owner of the Seahawks and Blazers. GOOD MOVE:  Corbin sat four of his starters the entire fourth quarter to give them rest for the final three games. BAD MOVE:  Utah's  DeMarre Carroll  and  Derrick Favors  hit heads going for a rebound in the fourth quarter. Neither player returned to the game. QUOTABLE III:  "He's coming around. He's turned the corner, just being aggressive. He's doing a great job for us."   --  Corbin on Harris. NOTABLE:  Portland's  Luke Babbitt  was 2 for 7 from 3-point range, leaving him at .464 (39-84) for the season. Babbitt needs to make five treys in the final three games to qualify for the NBA leaders. New York's Steve Novak went into Wednesday leading the league at .472. UP NEXT:  For the Trail Blazers, at Memphis Saturday, at San Antonio Monday, at Utah Thursday. For the Jazz, Orlando Saturday, Phoenix Tuesday, Portland Thursday.
