 THE FACT:   Indiana improved to 10-0 at home for the first time in franchise history. 
 
 THE LEAD:   Continuing their early season trend, the Pacers dominated the second half to rally for a 90-84 victory over the visiting Miami Heat in a rematch of the 2013 Eastern Conference Finals before a sellout crowd of 18,165 at Bankers Life Fieldhouse Tuesday night.  
 Indiana (19-3) outscored Miami 50-37 in the second half and won for the 10th time in 12 games when trailing at halftime.  Roy Hibbert  scored 24 while  Paul George  and  David West  scored 17 apiece for the Pacers, who trailed by as many as 13 in the first half.  LeBron James  and  Dwyane Wade  score 17 apiece for Miami (16-6). 
 
 QUOTABLE:   "The term 'statement win' is for you guys [media] to write about, not for me to talk about."  
 
 -- Indiana coach  Frank Vogel 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Pacers lead the NBA in second-half scoring at 53.5 points per, with George averaging 15.3, including 15 against the Heat. 
 
 TURNING POINT:   Miami led 46-35 late in the second quarter, but West scored on a post-up and  Lance Stephenson  converted a driving three-point play before the buzzer to give the Pacers some life heading into the locker room. Then, they roared back out of it. George scored 12 in the third period, including consecutive 3-pointers in a 13-5 run that put Indiana up 68-62. Despite several challenges from the Heat, the Pacers would not relinquish the lead. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I wish we didn't have to rely on the third quarter. We didn't play that well in the first half but we were only down seven. We knew we were going to fight back."  
 
 -- Roy Hibbert 
 
 
 HOT:   Hibbert shot 10-for-15 while West was 6-for-8 as Indiana exploited its strength inside. James had 14 rebounds and six assists.  Norris Cole  went 4-for-5 off the Miami bench. 
 
 NOT:   James and Wade combined to shoot 12-for-30. George had six turnovers, West seven as the Pacers committed 21 that led to 20 Miami points. 
 
 QUOTABLE III : "The biggest difference in Paul [George] I think is confidence. He has the confidence of being the go-to-guy, knowing that he's the guy that has to go out and do it every night."  
 
 -- LeBron James 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Pacers played the Spurs, Thunder and Heat in a four-day span, winning twice and losing only in Oklahoma City. ... Indiana had 13 turnovers and six assists in the first half, 16 assists and eight turnovers in the second. ... Justin Timberlake watched the game from a front-row seat at midcourt. ... Indiana is 10-2 when trailing at halftime, 17-0 when leading after three quarters. ... Miami fell to 13-3 with Wade in the lineup. He returned after missing Sunday's victory in Detroit with a minor knee ailment. ... Leading 86-77 with 3:06 remaining, the Pacers were on the short end of two consecutive instant replay reversals down the stretch. The first overturned an out-of-bounds ruling and gave the ball to Miami, while the second erased a goal-tending call by  Chris Andersen  on a Stephenson drive and took points off the board, leaving the home team with an 86-81 lead entering the final minute. But James air-balled a 3-point attempt and West answered with a driving left-hander to make it 88-81 with 38.9 seconds left. After Wade missed a 3, Stephenson got loose for a game-sealing dunk. ... Miami played without reserve forward  Michael Beasley  for the third consecutive game with a strained left hamstring. ... Indiana hopes to regain the services of veteran forward  Danny Granger  for Friday's game against Charlotte. A strained left calf delayed Granger's comeback from major knee surgery last season. ... West surpassed 5,000 career rebounds. ... This was Miami's first loss when holding an opponent to fewer than 100 points. ... James failed to score at least 20 points for the first time in 11 games. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Pacers, Friday vs. Charlotte, Monday vs. Detroit, Dec. 18 @ Miami. For the Heat, Saturday vs. Cleveland, Monday vs. Utah, Dec. 18 vs. Pacers.
