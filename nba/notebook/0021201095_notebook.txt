 THE FACTS:   Bradley Beal  matched his career-high with six 3-pointers and scored 24 points off the bench in his return from a sprained left ankle, as the Washington Wizards defeated the Toronto Raptors 109-92 on Sunday night for their seventh straight home win.  
 
 John Wall  expertly directed the Wizards' offense, finishing with 18 points and 10 assists with only one turnover as Washington (27-46) snapped a two-game losing streak.  Emeka Okafor  had 18 points and 10 rebounds.  Jonas Valanciunas  scored 16 of his 18 points in the first half and had 10 rebounds for the Raptors (27-46), who have lost seven of eight games.  DeMar DeRozen  and  Kyle Lowry  each scored 15 points, but, collectively, Toronto struggled offensively, shooting 39.5 percent from the floor.  
 
 QUOTABLE : "We want to end on a good note, make a run for the ninth seed. As a team we want to be able to go into next year with the right mindset, the right goals. Finish up strong so it carries over into next year." 
 -- Bradley Beal on the Wizards goal of finishing ninth in the Eastern Conference after opening the season with a 4-28 record 
 
 THE STAT : Led by Beal's production, the Wizards held a 62-25 bench-scoring advantage.  Kevin Seraphin  had 11 of his 13 points in the first half,  Trevor Ariza  scored 10 and  Jan Vesely  chipped in with all nine of his points before halftime. The trio scored half of Washington's 60 first half points. The Wizards led 60-50 at halftime. 
 
 QUOTABLE II :  "To be honest, we just got to be focused, man. We got to understand we only have so many games left. We have to put our mind to it and play hard every game. It's as simple as that. We can't look at it like we're not playing for something." 
 -- DeMar DeRozen, on what's changed for the Raptors during their current slide 
 
 HOT : Beal missed the previous five games with a sprained left ankle and 11 games this month, but showed no signs of rust in his return. After the Raptors pulled closer at 70-62 in the third quarter, Beal drained three 3-pointers. After  Martell Webster' s traditional three-point play, the rookie guard sank his fourth shot from beyond the arc in the quarter. Beal, who also made six 3-pointers against Sacramento on January 16, finished 6-for-9 overall,  
 
 NOT :  DeRozen misfired on 12 of his 18 field goal attempts, including 7 of the 10 in the third quarter. 
 
 QUOTABLE III :  "We were really struggling a little bit against their zone. He really came in and made some big shots for us." 
 -- John Wall on Beal's third quarter impact 
 
 NOTABLE :   Rudy Gay  scored 11 points and  Sebastian Telfair  had 10 for the Raptors, including a half court shot ending the 3-quarter. ...Vesely's nine points matched the total from his previous 13 games. ...Beal, who played for the University of Florida last season, had three times as many 3-pointers as the Gators sank in Sunday's 79-59 Elite Eight loss to Michigan. "Somebody had to do something from Florida," Beal cracked. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Raptors, Monday vs. Pistons, Wednesday vs. Wizards, Friday @ Timberwolves. For the Wizards,Tuesday vs, Bulls, Wednesday @ Raptors, Saturday vs. Pacers.
