  Notebook: Hawks 97, Pacers 87 Posted Wednesday February 8, 2012 10:57PM By Matt Winkeljohn, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  The Hawks re-discovered their defense,  Josh Smith  was superb and  Kirk Hinrich  finally found his stroke Wednesday as the reserve guard scored a season-high 17 points to help Atlanta snap a three-game losing streak with a 97-87 win over the visiting Pacers. Smith had 28 points, 12 rebounds, five steals, three assists and three blocks to break a slump of his own, but Hinrich was the difference maker. He entered the game having made shooting 31.4 percent in seven games since returning from shoulder surgery. He made 7-for-9 shots and 3-for-5 3-pointers. Atlanta (17-9) had allowed shooting percentages of 48.2, 50.0 and a season-worst 51.9 in losing to Memphis, Philadelphia and Phoenix in Philips Arena, but the Pacers (17-8) shot 40 percent (22-for-55) in quarters other than the third (11-for-20) and 44 percent overall (33-for-75). Atlanta sqaundered away much of a 59-41 halftime lead with a poor third quarter, where the Pacers pulled within 75-69. Indiana was as close as seven points early in the fourth, but after bringing a 10-5 road record into the game, Indiana fell for the ninth straight time in Atlanta dating back to Dec. 22, 2006. Danny Granger  scored 21 points for Indiana, and  David West  and reserve forward  Tyler Hansbrough  added 15 each. QUOTABLE:  "We're like night and day different when we play with energy. When we play with energy, we're just a totally different team. [Smith] played just super. I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for what he brings to the table. He is a guy who can impact it on both ends. He played a lot of minutes (46:01) . . . he was absolutely unbelievable tonight."   -- Hawks coach  Larry Drew . THE STAT:  In jumping out to as much as a 16-point lead in the first quarter, the Hawks scored 14 fastbreak points and had eight assists -- both stark upgrades from their three-game swoon. On the evening, Atlanta outscored Indiana 14-3 on the break. The margin was 28-11 by game's end. MORE STATS:  The Hawks are 12-1 when  Joe Johnson  scores 20 points or more (he had 20), and 7-1 when he has five or more assists (he had eight to tie a season high). . . . Atlanta is 6-0 when Smith scores 20 or more, and 12-0 when making at least 45 percent of its shots (46.1 percent, 35-for-76 shooting). TURNING POINT:  There was no turning point as the Pacers' only lead came when  Paul George  made a free throw for a 1-0 lead, but the difference between Wednesday's Hawks and the outfit that lost the previous three games -- all at home -- was evident in a first-quarter sequence. When Indiana center  Roy Hibbert  went up for a dunk, Hawks center  Zaza Pachulia  blocked the attempt, Hinrich plucked the loose ball, and just a few seconds later Joe Johnson got up a 3-point shot. He missed, but Pachulia had hustled down court to grab the offensive rebound (Atlanta won the battle of the boards 45-33). He made a no-look bounce pass across the lane to  Marvin Williams , who dunked for a 24-12 lead with 4:24 left in the first quarter. QUOTABLE II:  "[The Hawks] came out tonight with a tremendous edge about them, and they took the fight to us in the first half. We dug too big a hole for ourselves."   -- Pacers coach  Frank Vogel . HOT:  Hinrich made 4-for-5 shots for nine points in the first quarter, when he played just 7:57 in part because starting point guard  Jeff Teague  picked up two fouls in the first 4:03. . . . West made all four of his shots in the second quarter, including a trey, for nine points. NOT:  Hawks small forward Marvin Williams turned in his fourth straight single-digit scoring night. After making 2-for-7 shots for five points, he's averaged 7.5 points in that span. . . . Indiana's Paul George turned in his least productive game in some time with five points on 1-for-8 shooting. He missed all three 3-point attempts, and had just three rebounds and one assist. NOTABLE:  Atlanta starters Smith (46:01), Johnson (43:59) and Pachulia (38:18) played heavy minutes, and Drew did not dip into his bench much other than in going to Hinrich (22:24) and  Tracy McGrady  (21:53). McGrady played as well as in weeks, pitching in 13 points, two rebounds and two assists. ... Hawks subs  Ivan Johnson  (9:42),  Willie Green  (7:22) and  Vladimir Radmanovic (1:59) were scoreless in a total of 19:03. ... Joe Johnson needs 39 points to become the seventh Hawk to reach 10,000 career points. ... The Pacers are 1-8 when scoring 89 or fewer points. ... Indiana is 2-12 when its bench is out-scored (Atlanta subs out-scored the Pacers' reserves 30-27 with Hinrich and McGrady doing all the scoring for the Hawks). ... With centers  Al Horford  (torn pectoral muscle) and  Jason Collins  (sprained elbow) shelved, Drew said he hopes that the Hawks will add a big man to the roster within a few days. He did not suggest whom it might be, or whether the player would sign a 10-day contract or for the rest of the season. UP NEXT:  For the Pacers, Friday @ Memphis, Saturday vs. Denver, Tuesday vs. Miami. For the Hawks, Friday @ Orlando, Sunday vs. Miami, Tuesday @ L.A. Lakers.
