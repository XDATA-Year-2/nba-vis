 THE FACT:  The Sixers snapped a season-worst four-game losing streak by beating Milwaukee.  
 
 THE LEAD:  Evan Turner  scored eight of his 27 points in overtime as the Sixers beat the Milwaukee Bucks 115-107. 
 
  Spencer Hawes  added 25 points and 12 rebounds for the Sixers (6-8), who erased a 10-point deficit in the final 2:08 of regulation. Hawes' 3-pointer from the left corner with 1.7 seconds left -- a shot he made while jumping off one foot with Milwaukee's  Gary Neal  draped all over him -- forced the extra period. 
 Milwaukee's  Caron Butler  scored a season-high 38 points, two off his career high, and  Ersan Ilyasova  added a season-high 19. The Bucks (2-9) nonetheless lost their seventh straight, their longest skid since they dropped their final eight games in 2007-08. 
 QUOTABLE: "We were very lucky. Spencer got us to where we needed to go, and Evan took us home." 
 -- Sixers coach  Brett Brown 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Sixers owned a 50-32 rebounding advantage, the second time this season they have out-rebounded an opponent by 10 or more. They have out-boarded their last two opponents, after failing to do so in their six previous games. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Hawes' shot at the end of regulation. He took the inbounds pass from Turner and wheeled on Neal. Brown said it came on a play  Stan Van Gundy  often used when he coached the Orlando Magic. 
 
 HOT:  Hawes shot 11-for-16 from the floor, 3-for-6 from 3-point range. Turner was 10-for-18, 8-for-12 in the fourth quarter and overtime. Sixers rookie  Hollis Thompson  went 7-for-9 from the field en route to scoring 16 points, a high for his 12-game-old NBA career. Butler shot 13-for-22 from the floor, 4-for-8 from the arc. 
 
 NOT:  Milwaukee's  O.J. Mayo  was 3-for-12, and teammate  Gary Neal  went 3-for-10 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Brown's decision to play Thompson nearly 21 minutes, his second-highest total of the season. Thompson scored eight of his points in a 20-7 flurry spanning the first and second quarters, when the Sixers extended a 17-15 lead to 37-22. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Luke Ridnour , a career 86.5-percent foul shooter, made just the second of two free throws with 3.9 seconds left in regulation. That left Milwaukee with a 102-99 lead, and set the stage for Hawes. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The announced attendance was 13,588. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I didn't intend on shooting it off one foot. That was not how I saw it going in my mind." 
 -- Hawes 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Sixers shot a season-best 57 percent from the floor, but committed a season-high 26 turnovers, leading to 28 Milwaukee points. ... Philadelphia guard  Tony Wroten  left the game in the second half with a strained lower back, and Brown does not expect him to be available for Saturday's game in Indiana. ... The Sixers were without forward  Thaddeus Young  (personal reasons) for the second straight game, and Brown said before the game that the team is "going to allow him his space and let him handle the situation as he feels it best suits him and his family." ... Bucks guard  Brandon Knight  missed his fifth straight game with a sore right hamstring. ...Ilyasova made his first start since Nov. 2, after coming off the bench in Wednesday's loss to Portland and missing the previous six games with a sore right ankle. ... Mayo played despite injuring an ankle Wednesday against Portland. ... Sixers point guard  Michael Carter-Williams  had 12 points, 11 assists, eight rebounds and five steals, but also committed five turnovers before fouling out. ... The Sixers, who have not defended the arc well all year, limited the Bucks -- a good 3-point-shooting team -- to 8-for-29 marksmanship from deep. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "I thought the game was kind of in our control, but we haven't developed a winning brand of basketball yet. ... With that being said, you tip your hat to Philadelphia." 
 -- Butler
