  Notebook: Suns 104, Timberwolves 95 Posted Friday March 2, 2012 12:48AM By Mike Tulumello, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  The Minnesota Timberwolves couldn't beat the schedule Thursday night. The Phoenix Suns slowly wore down the visiting Timberwolves, the NBA's only team to play the first three nights coming out of the All Star break, en route to a 104-95 win. For the Suns (15-20),  Steve Nash  had 13 points, 17 assists and eight rebounds.  Grant Hill  had 10 points while  Shannon Brown  gave them a much-needed lift off the bench with 12 points. For the Timberwolves (18-19),  Kevin Love  had 23 points and 10 rebounds but shot only 8-for-25. The Suns struggled through early foul problems as the Timberwolves ran up a 44-34 early lead, one the Suns' sliced to 51-46 at hafltime. "We said, 'Let's keep our composure. They played the last two nights,'" Hill said. The Wolves still led 70-64 in the third quarter, then  Channing Frye  hit a 3-pointer to start the Suns on a 13-4 run that made it 77-74 Suns heading into the final quarter. The Suns, leading 81-79 with 9:00 left, rolled off nine straight points capped by Hill's 3-point play, to ;take a 90-79 lead. A Nash 3-point shot with 3:30 left gave the Suns a 96-87 lead, allowing them to coast home. The Wolves, who ran up an NBA season-best 72 points off the bench Tuesday night, got only 6-for-21 shooting and 18 points from their reserves. QUOTABLE:  "A lot of what happens this season is the schedule...But there are no excuses. This is a character game."   --  Timberwolves coach  Rick Adelman , acknowledging before the game that he was "very worried' about his team's energy level as they took the floor for the third night in a row. THE STAT:  The Suns, the No. 26 team in rebounding percentage, outboarded the No. 6 Wolves, 44-37. Love, who averages 13.8 rebounds was held to 10, including three on one play late in the game, in 40 minutes. TURNING POINT:  Though the Suns didn't surpass the T-Wolves until late in the third quarter (on a spectacular fast-break slam by Brown) they started to break the Timberwolves' stranglehold on a slow pace late in the first half. QUOTABLE II:  "He's a beauty. We needed every bit of him tonight."   --  Nash on teammate Hill. HOT:  Hill shot 8-for-12. NOT:  The Timberwolves shot 1-for-13 on 3-pointers.
