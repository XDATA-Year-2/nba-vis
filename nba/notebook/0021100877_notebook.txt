  Notebook: Pacers 102, Cavaliers 83 Posted Friday April 13, 2012 10:28PM By Conrad Brunner, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  If you were expecting champagne in the locker room after Indiana clinched a playoff berth, you were disappointed. The Pacers have much bigger things in mind than simply getting there. Recovering from a staggeringly slow start, Indiana took control of the game with a dominating third quarter and rolled to a 102-83 rout of visiting Cleveland at Bankers Life Fieldhouse Friday, securing a second consecutive playoff berth. With three wins in a row and seven in eight games, the Pacers (37-22) have maintained their grip on the third seed in the Eastern Conference playoff bracket, three games up on fourth-place Boston and two on fifth-place Atlanta. They're seeking homecourt advantage in the first round of the playoffs for the first time since 2004.  Danny Granger  scored nine of his 18 in the third quarter,  Tyler Hansbrough  scored 16 off the bench and  George Hill  had another strong start in place of the injured  Darren Collison  with 15 points and seven assists.  Omri Casspi  led Cleveland (19-38) with 14 points. QUOTABLE:  "We haven't accomplished anything yet. Nothing has changed for us. We felt for a while we would be in the playoffs but until we get home court advantage there is still work to be done."   - - Indiana Coach  Frank Vogel THE STAT:  Indiana's 7-1 record is the NBA's best in April. TURNING POINT:  The Pacers missed 25 of their first 31 shots in falling behind 32-18 early in the second quarter. Hill took over, scoring 10 as the Pacers trimmed the deficit to 43-41 at the half. With the momentum gained, the Pacers seized full control of the game in the third period, limiting the Cavs to 1-of-13 shooting and bolting to a 56-46 lead that eventually grew to 21. The Pacers outscored the Cavs 34-13 in the period as Cleveland shot 3-of-18 with five turnovers. QUOTABLE II:  "We want to continue and get a good spot in the playoffs, mainly home court advantage. This was a step in that direction and only a step in that direction. We must continue."   - - Hill HOT:  Hill has totaled 50 points (16.7), 16 assists (5.3) and 14 rebounds (4.7) in starting the last three games at point guard in place of the injured Collison (groin).  Roy Hibbert  had his 18th double-double with 12 points and 10 rebounds. NOT: Manny Harris  missed all five of his shots for Cleveland, while  Alonzo Gee  shot 2 of 12. The Cavs shot 35.4 percent overall, 28.9 percent in the second half (11 of 38). QUOTABLE III:  "We weren't aggressive enough in the second half. We did a bad job of playing 48 minutes. The third quarter is really what got us out of the game."    -- Cleveland's  Antawn Jamison GOOD MOVE:  With his teammates unable to hit anything early in the game, Hill took it upon himself to get the offense going in the second quarter. His 3-pointer seemed to give the Pacers some offensive stability and they quickly regained their stride, closing the half on a 23-11 run with Hill scoring 10 of the points to gain the momentum. BAD MOVE:  Cleveland rookie  Tristan Thompson  maintained a running dialogue with Pacers veteran  David West , with the players eventually drawing double technical fouls early in the third quarter. Thompson's timing couldn't have been worse, as the Cavs quickly disintegrated. NOTABLE:  After shooting 6-of-31 (.194) through the first 17 minutes and falling behind 32-18, the Pacers shot 31-of-59 (.525) the rest of the way and outscored the Cavs 84-51. ... The Pacers have held six consecutive opponents to less than 100 points, the second-longest active streak in the league. ...  Kyrylo Fesenko  made his Pacers debut in the fourth quarter after Lou Amundson fouled out. He played the final 6 1/2 minutes. ... Collison missed his third game in a row with a sore groin and is listed as day-to-day for the Pacers' game in Milwaukee Saturday. ... Indiana improved to 7-0 when  Leandro Barbosa  scores in double figures and 16-4 when Hill does the same. ... Cleveland was without two starters, point guard  Kyrie Irving  (shoulder) and power forward  Anderson Varejao  (wrist), as well as backup center  Semih Erden , who rolled his right ankle Wednesday night against the Pacers in Cleveland and will miss at least one more game. UP NEXT:  For the Pacers, Saturday @ Milwaukee, Monday vs. Minnesota, Tuesday @ Philadelphia. For the Cavaliers, Saturday @ Washington, Sunday vs. Orlando, Tuesday @ Detroit.
