  Notebook: Bucks 119, Knicks 114 Posted Saturday March 10, 2012 12:25AM By Rick Braun, for NBA.com THE FACTS:   Ersan Ilyasova  scored 26 points, including five in the final 1:06,  Brandon Jennings  tallied 25 points and 10 assists and  Mike Dunleavy  added 25 as the Milwaukee Bucks survived a big New York rally to hold off the Knicks 119-114 Friday night at the Bradley Center. The Knicks rallied from a 108-93 deficit with 7:29 left and had a possession with a chance to take the lead but committed two costly turnovers in the final 90 seconds. Amar'e Stoudemire  scored 27 points and grabbed 11 rebounds,  Carmelo Anthony  had 22 points and  Jeremy Lin  had 20 points and 13 turnovers, but the Knicks (18-22) closed a four-game road trip at 0-4 and now lead the Bucks (16-24) by just two games for the eighth playoff spot in the East. QUOTABLE:  "In games like this you just have to find a way to get to those balls. We did a really good job as a team just keeping the play alive and never giving up."   -- Ersan Ilyasova on his two huge plays on the offensive boards THE STAT:  On four separate occasions -- three by Lin and once by Anthony -- the Knicks made shots from the 3-point arc with toes on the line. Turn those four 2-point baskets into 3-pointers and it's a very different story in the final minute. TURNING POINT:  The Knicks had cut a 108-93 deficit down to a single point, and Ilyasova had just one rebound in the first 46:54 of the game. But when  Drew Gooden 's shot was tipped by Anthony, Ilyasova was in perfect position for a tip and was fouled by  Baron Davis . He wasn't credited with a rebound, but his two free throws made it 114-111 with 1:06 left. Just 38 seconds later, Jennings' desperation underhand shot with the shot clock running down was tapped toward the basket by Gooden, and Ilyasova was in perfect position to tip it in for a 116-113 lead with 28.7 seconds left. Ilyasova capped his big final 66 seconds by claiming the rebound of  Steve Novak 's missed 3-pointer with four seconds left and made 1 of 2 free throws to close the scoring. Ilyasova also had a game-winning tip with two seconds left in a 119-118 victory over Washington on Feb. 28. QUOTABLE II:  "He was on small guys quite a bit. They were playing small tonight so he was away from the basket quite a bit. He's been near the rim late in games for us and bailed us out multiple times."   -- Bucks coach  Scott Skiles  on Ilyasova's big plays down the stretch HOT:  Ilyasova was 9-for-13, making him 23-for-31 (74.2 percent) in the last two games and averaging 29 points. NOT:  Gooden made just 4-for-12 shots but still had a double-double with 12 points and 10 rebounds. He also had five assists. INSIDE THE ARENA:  With Lin making his first appearance at the Bradley Center since the onset of Linsanity, the Bucks recorded just their second sellout of the season (18,717), with an unusually high amount of Asian-American fans in the stands cheering for Lin and the Knicks. GOOD MOVE:  As the Bucks sat and watched the Knicks make their first 11 shots, Skiles sent in second-year forward  Larry Sanders  for defense. Sanders helped turn the game around as an inside defensive presence and finished with 11 rebounds, nine points and three blocked shots in just 16 minutes. BAD MOVE:  With a 116-113 lead and the ball with 23 seconds left, the Bucks could not get the ball inbounds and were called for a five-second violation. They managed to hold on despite that gaffe. NOTABLE:  The Knicks made their first 11 shots of the night to race out to a 26-16 lead. Their first miss wasn't really a missed shot so much as a bad pass on a lob, but the official scorer called it a missed shot rather than a turnover. The Bucks then closed the quarter with an 18-6 run and led, 36-34, after one. ... The Bucks are 12-4 when scoring 100 points or more. ... Milwaukee went 13 for 26 on 3-pointers. ... Lin's double-double was his sixth of the year. ... Bucks forward  Luc Richard Mbah a Moute  returned after missing two games with a sore right knee but did not return after the half because of the injury. Also, Bucks guard  Shaun Livingston  did not play in the second half because of a left ankle injury. ... Knicks center  Tyson Chandler  missed his second straight game with an ankle injury but could return Sunday vs. Philadelphia. UP NEXT:  For the Knicks, Sunday vs. Philadelphia, Monday @ Chicago, Wednesday vs. Portland. For the Bucks, Sunday @ Toronto, Monday @ New Jersey, Wednesday vs. Cleveland.
