 THE FACTS: Luis Scola  scored 19 of his 21 points in the second half and the Phoenix Suns survived a late Philadelphia rally to beat the Sixers 95-89 and snap a six-game losing streak. 
 The Suns led by as many as 11 early in the fourth quarter before watching Philadelphia cut the lead to 87-85 when  Jrue Holiday  dribbled a step past halfcourt and found  Dorell Wright  charging down the right side for an alley-oop layup. Unlike recent games, however, Phoenix was able to recover from its opponent's run. 
 
 
Goran Dragi c hit a pair of free throws and  P.J. Tucke r added a jumper to put the Suns (12-1) in front 91-85 with 1:18 left.  
 Holiday finished with 16 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds for his second career triple-double, and Wright and  Thaddeus Young  added 14 points apiece for the 76ers (15-18). 
 
 Dragic had 20 points, six assists and three blocked shots,  Shannon Brow n scored 12 an d Marcin Gorta t added 11 points and 14 rebounds for the Suns, who snapped a four-game losing streak against Philadelphia. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It's only one win but we needed the one win."  
 -- Scola 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Suns forced the 76ers into 17 turnovers and held Philadelphia to 10 offensive rebounds on 47 missed shots. 
 
 
 TURNING POINT:  As per usual, Phoenix was on the verge of letting the game slip away in the second quarter. Philadelphia opened the period with a 17-6 run to turn a seven-point deficit after the first into a 41-37 lead with 5:30 left in the first half. But the Suns wouldn't fold. Dragic and  Jared Dudley  had consecutive baskets to tie the game and Philly led by only one at halftime. An 8-2 run to start the third quarter, sparked by Scola's consecutive baskets, gave the Suns the lead for good. 
 
 HOT:  Scola was 6-for-8 from the floor in the second half and 7-for-8 from the free-throw stripe. Though he had only two first-half points, his six assists at halftime were as many as the rest of his teammates combined and only two behind Holiday's eight.. 
 
 NOT:  Philadelphia center  Spencer Hawes  came in with three double-digit performances in his past four games. Against the Suns, however, he scored six points on 3-for-11 shooting across 24-plus largely ineffectual minutes. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Suns backup point guard  Sebastian Telfair  missed the second half with soreness in his left knee. ... Phoenix has won five of seven at home. ... The 76ers finished with as many blocked shots -- three -- as Dragic. ... The teams combined for only 18 fast-break points. ... Holiday's 10 rebounds matched a career high. 
 
 IN THE ARENA:  More than 1,200 Kansas State fans, in town for Thursday's Fiesta Bowl matchup against Oregon, were among the 16,000-plus in attendance. They started chanting for former Wildcat  Michael Beasley  to enter the game, despite the forward's firm place near the end of the Suns' bench, and booed Suns forward  Markieff Morris , a one-time Kansas Jayhawk, when he checked into the game. The fans got their wish when Beasley entered the game at the start of the second quarter, going 1-for-4 from the floor for two points to go with four rebounds and a blocked shot in 6:44 on the court -- his only game action of the night.. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I told Markieff that Big 12 stuff runs deep."  
 -- Suns coach  Alvin Gentry 
 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the 76ers, Friday @ Oklahoma City, Saturday @ San Antonio, Tuesday vs. Brooklyn. For the Suns, Friday vs. Utah, Sunday vs. Memphis, Tuesday @ Milwaukee.
