 THE FACT S: In a game lacking  Deron Williams, Danilo Gallinari  and  Andre Iguodala , the Brooklyn Nets flipped one of their season's scripts, riding strong second and third quarter performances to a 119-108 victory over the Denver Nuggets Wednesday night at Barclays Center.  C.J. Watson  excelled in Williams' place with 25 points along with six dishes and  Joe Johnson  dominated stretches of the second half, finishing with 26 points and nine assists for Brooklyn (31-22).  Ty Lawson  (26 points and nine assists, five turnovers) led the Nuggets (33-21) and pushed the game's tempo, creating a hectic pace not usually a defining trait of Nets games.   
 
 QUOTABLE : "When you have one of your key guys out, I think it motivates guys to really step up and play a little harder. Guys that haven't played as much tend to come in and play big minutes and be successful."  
 -- Joe Johnson  
 
 THE STAT : The two teams combined to shoot 28-for-44 from behind the 3-point line.  
 
 TURNING POINT : The Nets went on a 15-2 run in the third quarter, pushing a seven-point lead to 20. The run featured a number of wide open 3-pointers.  
 
 QUOTABLE II : "I am very excited. It is a huge honor and I really just can't wait to get out there."
