 THE FACTS :  Shannon Brown , who scored 24 points against Charlotte on Nov. 7, tallied a season-high 26 points and the Phoenix Suns used 17 shots from 3-point land to send the Bobcats to their 13th straight loss, 121-104, on Wednesday night. 
 
 Goran Dragic  added 21 points and 11 assists while  Jared Dudley  had 20 for the Suns (11-15), who have won four straight games for the first time since the 2010-11 season. 
 
 Kemba Walker  scored 11 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter and  Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  added 25 for the Bobcats (7-18), who are winless since matching their win total from last season on Nov. 24. 
 Phoenix led by as many as 30 points in the closing minute of the third quarter, saw the Bobcats cut the lead in half but used a late 12-5 run to secure the win and a 4-1 homestand. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "If we run our offense, it ain't like I'm doing one-on-one moves and stuff like that. For the most part, we're moving the ball and finishing each other and that opens the ball up for each other."  
 -- Shannon Brown 
 
 THE STAT : Brown was 10-for-16 from the floor, 5-for-7 from behind the arc and added four rebounds and two assists in 34 minutes. He also recorded a steal in 12 straight games, the fifth-longest active streak in the league. 
 
 TURNING POINT : Phoenix's second unit, led by  Sebastian Telfair , outscored Charlotte 13-2 over the first 5:37 of the second quarter. That opened a 41-29 lead that grew to as many as 20 before halftime. Telfair scored all 11 of his points during the period. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "We're a young team. We still feel pretty confident in ourselves. As long as we're getting better, we definitely will all just come together. Good things are going to happen for us. Right now we're losing, but I think good things are going to happen for us pretty soon."  
 -- Kemba Walker 
 
 HOT : The Suns set season highs for points (121), second-quarter points (36), first-half points (64) and 3-pointers (17). The Suns also posted consecutive 30-point quarters for the first time this season. 
 
 NOT : After trailing only 28-27 deficit after the first quarter, the Bobcats made only 3 of their 15 field goals and were outscored 36-19 in the second. Only 11 free throws kept what was an 18-point deficit from being far worse. 
 
 NOTABLE : The Suns have swept the Bobcats six times in Charlotte's nine-year history. ... Phoenix finished a five-game homestand with at least four wins for the first time since 2007-08. .... Kidd-Gilchrist and Walker each were 9-for-14 from the floor. The remainder of the Bobcats were 22-for-58 for 37.9 percent. ... During their four-game winning streak, the Suns have averaged 100.8 points and only 10.5 turnovers per game. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH : Kidd-Gilchrist matched a career high. He also added 12 rebounds, three steals, four assists and a block. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Bobcats, Friday @ Warriors, Saturday @ Nuggets, Wednesday vs. Heat. For the Suns, Saturday @ Blazers, Sunday vs. L.A. Clippers, Wednesday vs. Knicks.
