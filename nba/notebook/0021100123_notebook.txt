  Notebook: Suns 109, Bucks 93   By Mike Tulumello, for NBA.com Posted Sunday January 8, 2012 10:47PM THE FACTS:  The last time it happened  Ronald Reagan  had nearly two years to go as president, "Euro" surely didn't mean money and the Internet was the stuff of sci-fi movies. Yes, nothing has changed when the Milwaukee Bucks visit the Phoenix Suns. The Suns won their 24th straight in Phoenix in the series, whipping the Bucks, 109-93, Sunday night. The last time the Bucks won in Arizona: Feb. 21, 1987, or 9,087 days ago. The streak is one of the longest in big-league sports and the second-longest such string in the NBA. (The Spurs have beaten the Warriors at home 27 straight, a string that dates to 1997.) Center  Marcin Gortat  led the Suns with 18 points.  Steve Nash  passed out 17 assists and, more important, got a couple of slumbering Suns going. Channing Frye , who had hit only 17 percent of his 3-pointers coming into the game, nailed 4-for-4 and finished with 16 points. And  Grant Hill , shooting just 35 percent from the field, hit 6-for-11 for 14 points. "When Channing Frye makes shots, it stretches things out," Suns coach  Alvin Gentry  said. The Suns, who started 0-3, evened their record at 4-4. The short-handed Bucks (2-6) closed out their Western trip by losing their fifth straight. Among their missing, center  Andrew Bogut , who missed his fourth straight game for personal reasons. Rookie  Tobias Harris  led the Bucks with 15 points. QUOTABLE:  "I don't care if they didn't win here in the Millard Fillmore administration," --  Gentry, before tipoff of the Bucks' quarter-century losing streak in Phoenix. THE STAT:  Nash rolled up 10 assists and just one turnover in the first quarter. TURNING POINT:  When Bucks coach  Scott Skiles  announced beforehand that Bogut would miss the game, as would guard  Beno Udrih  (shoulder) and forward  Luc Mbah a Moute  (knee). The Bucks expect Bogut back Tuesday, at home vs. the Spurs. On the floor, the Suns broke open a 10-point game -- they led 57-47 at halftime -- by obliterating the Bucks in the third quarter. By the time, the lead reached 87-62, Skiles emptied his bench. QUOTABLE II:  "For the first time this year, we shot the ball like we're capable of shooting."   --  Gentry on the Suns 56 percent shooting (46 percent from long range). FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Gortat, seemingly liberated by the removal of a splint on his injured thumb, shot 9-for-10. Since the brace was removed, he's shot 15-for-18 (.833) the past two games. ROOKIE WATCH:  The Suns' blossoming  Markief Morris  had 13 points and 10 boards. NOTABLE:  The Suns are 19-0 in their present arena vs. the Bucks in a series that dates to 1968, when the teams entered the NBA together as expansion franchises. The Bucks won a big one before that, though: the 1969 coin flip for  Lew Alcindor  ( Karrem Abdul-Jabbar ). UP NEXT:  For the Bucks, Tuesday vs. Spurs, Thursday vs. Pistons and Friday @ Dallas. For the Suns, Tuesday @ Los Angeles Lakers, Thursday vs. Cavs and Friday vs. Nets.
