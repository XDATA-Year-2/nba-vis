  Notebook: Raptors 96, Knicks 79 Posted Friday March 23, 2012 11:58PM By Duane Watson, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  The Toronto Raptors (16-32) defeated the New York Knicks (23-25) 96-79 halting a three game losing streak on Friday at the Air Canada Centre. The Knicks were looking to win their sixth game in a row after beating the Raptors at home 106-87 as recently as Tuesday. But with  DeMar DeRozan  scoring a game high 30 points,  Andrea Bargnani  adding 21 points and  Gary Forbes  with 19 points off the bench they never gave up the lead and stretched it as high as 22 points. New York struggled offensively all game, shooting .376 from the field (32-for-85) and .179 from the 3-point line on 5-for-28 shooting and also added 22 turnovers for their efforts.  Amar'e Stoudemire  led the Knicks with 17 points, Steve Novak had 15 and Carmelo Anthony added 12 points and 9 rebounds. The Knicks were ineffective from the opening tip and the Raptors didn't give them a chance to get back in the game, clinching their 8th home win of the season. QUOTABLE:  "We definitely got 'DeBo'd' a little bit in New York and that's not the team we are. Today we just wanted to play one quarter at a time and win every quarter and we succeeded."   -- Raptors forward  James Johnson THE STAT:  The Knicks are second worst in the league averaging 16.3 per game. They committed 22 Friday night offering up 22 Raptors points off of those turnovers. The Knicks starters gave up 15 turnovers as opposed to a Raptors team that gave up 17. TURNING POINT:  While the Raptors never trailed in the game and led 70-53 after three quarters, the Knicks started the fourth quarter on 7-0 run bringing the margin to 10 points. DeRozan's emphatic baseline dunk with 5:56 made the score 82-65 putting the Raptors up 17 points, a margin that would be securely held for the remainder of the game. QUOTABLE II:  "I just think it was one of those games where scheduling and fatigue caught up with us. We just looked flat including myself. Everybody out there just looke a little fatigued."   -- Knicks center  Tyson Chandler HOT:  DeRozan went for 14 points in the 3rd quarter shooting 5-for-6 and sparking a 17-2 run to give the Raptors a 19 point lead, they're biggest of the game at that point. DeRozan scored 30 in the game before subbing himself out after tweaking his ankle with 2:59 left. He has averaged 20.4 points over his last 5 games. NOT:  Both teams tie here with an atrocious first half. The Knicks shot .355 from the field on 16-for-45 shooting, 1-for-9 shooting from 3-point line in addition to 10 turnovers. The Raptors went .333 from the field on 15-for-45 shooting, 1-for-11 from the 3-point line with 9 turnovers. Unfortunately, someone had to take the lead into halftime and it was the Raptors 39-36. GOOD MOVE:  With Raptors guard  Anthony Carter  recently waived and  Jerryd Bayless  out with a hip pointer, Raptors head coach  Dwane Casey  played seldom used guard Forbes. He stepped up with the new found court time scoring 17 points and 6 rebounds and 2 assists, particularly being effective in the Raptors second half when they put the game away. NOTABLE:  Toronto and New York split the season series 2-2... The Raptors shot .605 (23-38) from the floor in the final two quarters... The Raptors improve to 9-4 this season when holding opponents under 40 per cent shooting from the floor and 15-10 when shooting a better percentage than their opponent... Toronto shot a season low .077 (1-for-13) from three-point range... Knicks forward  Jared Jeffries  (knee) was not in the lineup. UP NEXT:  The Raptors are @ Chicago on Saturday and then return home vs. Orlando on Monday and Wednesday vs. Denver. The Knicks return home vs. Detroit on Saturday, vs. Milwaukee on Monday and Wednesday vs. Orlando.
