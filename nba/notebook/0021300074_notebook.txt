 THE FACT : Indiana has outscored all six opponents in the second half by a total of 85 points -- 53 in the third quarter alone. 
 
  THE LEAD : Taking over in the third quarter once again, the Pacers continued their perfect start with a 91-84 victory over the visiting Toronto Raptors Friday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. At 6-0, the Pacers matched the best start in franchise history (set in the 1970-71 ABA season) and will go for the franchise record Saturday in Brooklyn against the Nets in a showdown of Eastern Conference contenders.  Paul George  scored 23 with eight rebounds and six assists, while  Roy Hibbert  scored a season-high 20 to go with seven rebounds and two blocks for Indiana.  Rudy Gay  totaled 30 for Toronto (2-4). 
 
 QUOTABLE : "I give great halftime speeches ... No, our starters have a symmetry and a cohesion they established last season and the third quarter is when we play them together the most and they've been able to bust open some of these games." -- Indiana Coach  Frank Vogel  on the strong second-half performances. 
 
 THE STAT : After Gay scored 22 points on 9-for-13 shooting in the first half, he managed just eight points on 3-for-13 shooting in the second. George scored just five in the first half on 2-for-10 shooting but 18 in the second as he shot 5-for-11. 
 
 TURNING POINT : After a first half marked by Gay's dominance and the Raptors' effectiveness in transition, the Pacers tightened the screws in the third quarter, scoring the first 10 points to take a 54-46 lead, holding Toronto to 13 points on 5-for-18 shooting in the period to build a 72-59 lead heading into the fourth. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "We have to be able to put together a full game. There are spurts when we play as good as any team in the league. But we let up just a little bit and they were able to come back and take advantage of that." -- Gay 
 
 HOT : Hibbert shot 9-for-14 and raised his league-leading blocked-shot total to 28. ... Luis Scola shot 4-for-6 off the bench and is now at 61 percent for the season. ... Amir Johnson had a double-double (12 points, 10 rebounds) for the Raptors.  
 
 NOT : Toronto's  DeMar DeRozan  entered the game averaging 19.2 points but managed just six on 2-for-15 shooting. ... George shot 7-for-21 overall, 2-for-8 from the arc and is 13-for-40 (.325) in the last two games. 
 
 QUOTABLE III :  "They've got some firepower, no doubt about it. Any team  Kevin Garnett  is on is going to be a great defensive team. We expect them to be among the best of the best in the Eastern Conference this year and it'll be a great challenge." -- Vogel on Saturday's matchup in Brooklyn. 
 
 NOTABLE : After missing three games with a sore hip,  George Hill  returned to Indiana's starting lineup and managed 14 points in 19:25 and did not play in the fourth quarter as Vogel limited his minutes on the first night of a back-to-back. ...  Lance Stephenson  sat out most of the second quarter after banging his left knee but returned to start the third quarter. He failed to reach double figures for the first time. ...  Kyle Lowry  threatened a triple-double with 12 points, eight assists and seven rebounds for the Raptors. ... Toronto shot 10-for-35 (.286) in the second and third periods. ...  Tyler Hansbrough  had a quiet night in his return to Indianapolis, producing four points and five rebounds in 19:26. ... Former Pacer  D.J. Augustin  continued his shooting woes, missing both his shots. He's now 4-for-19 overall and 0-for-8 from the arc. ... George had a season-high six assists. ... With 32 in the first, the Raptors became the first team this season to score at least 30 in a quarter against the Pacers. 
 
 UP NEXT :  For the Pacers, Saturday at Brooklyn, Monday vs. Memphis, Friday vs. Milwaukee. For the Raptors, Saturday vs. Utah, Monday at Houston, Wednesday at Memphis.
