 THE FACTS: Stephen Curry  scored 20 of his 31 points in the fourth quarter and overtime Monday to lead the Golden State Warriors to a rare 105-101 road win over the Dallas Mavericks.  Harrison Barnes  tallied 20 points and 12 rebounds and  David Lee  added 17 points and 19 boards for Golden State, which had dropped 10 of its last 11 at the American Airlines Center. 
 
 O.J. Mayo  led Dallas with 27 points and nearly answered Curry bucket for bucket down the stretch, scoring seven of the Mavericks' last 10 points in regulation and all 11 of their points in the extra session.  Chris Kaman  finished with 18 points and 17 rebounds and  Troy Murphy  was the only other Maverick in double figures with 12. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I thought we did a great job of screening and then [Curry] did a great job of coming off aggressively, whether it be to score or make plays. He certainly ran this team down the stretch the way that I envision them running." 
 --Warriors coach  Mark Jackson 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Golden State is 6-0 when it wins the rebounding battle this season, although Dallas really didn't put up much of a fight. The Warriors dominated the glass, 62-43, including 19 offensive rebounds for 19 second-chance points. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  After Mayo made it 99-99 with a spin move and a short jumper with 41.9 seconds remaining, Curry penetrated the lane and dished to Lee for the go-ahead layup with 32.7 ticks left. The Mavericks came up empty on their next two possessions with misses by  Shawn Marion  and Mayo, while Curry and  Draymond Green  each made two free throws to clinch it. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I was able to make plays for my team tonight. Everybody on our team had a part of this win and that's what good teams do." 
 --Stephen Curry. 
 
 HOT:  Curry scored 14 of the Warriors' last 17 points in regulation. In overtime, he either scored or assisted on Golden State's first 13 points (six points, three assists). 
 
 NOT:  The shooting slump continues for second-year Golden State guard  Klay Thompson . He was just 2-for-14 against Dallas and is shooting 29.2 percent (26-for-89) from the field in his last six games. ... It was a rough night for Mavericks point guard  Darren Collison , other than his game-tying 20-footer with 37 seconds left in the fourth. He finished 2-for-11 with five fouls and five turnovers. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Considering he had hobbled to the locker room earlier in the fourth quarter clutching his right hamstring,  Vince Carter  may not have been the best option for the Mavs with the game knotted at 90-90 and a chance to win it in regulation. His off-balance 19-footer hit the back of the rim with 0.9 seconds left. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Curry's big night included three 3-pointers, a game-high nine assists, six rebounds and two steals. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Warriors center  Festus Ezeli  was 4-for-4 from the field and finished with nine points, eight rebounds and one block. Green had nine points, seven rebounds and three steals in 25-plus minutes off the bench. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Mavericks forward  Dirk Nowitzki  said he will update the media on the status of his right knee on Tuesday. The 11-time All-Star and all-time leading scorer in franchise history had surgery on Oct. 19 and was originally expected to miss six weeks. ... Golden State forward  Richard Jefferson  (right calf strain) did not play and is day-to-day. ... Marion made his 700th career 3-pointer in the fourth quarter. ... Mayo has scored at least 18 points in 10 consecutive games. Since 2002-03, the only Maverick besides Nowitzki with a streak that long was  Jason Terry  with 15 straight from Nov. 19-Dec. 21, 2008. ... Curry has made 30 consecutive free throws. ... The Mavericks have scored 100-plus points in 26 consecutive home games against the Warriors, the longest active streak in the NBA. ... Dallas is 0-6 when it trails by double digits. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Mavericks, Wednesday vs. New York, Saturday vs. Los Angeles Lakers, Nov. 27 @ Philadelphia. For the Warriors, Wednesday vs. Brooklyn, Friday @ Denver, Saturday vs. Minnesota.
