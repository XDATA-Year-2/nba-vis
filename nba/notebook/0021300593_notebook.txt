 THE FACT:  The Miami Heat have 15 straight wins against the Bobcats, which ties the San Antonio Spurs' streak over the Washington Wizards for longest streak against one team in the NBA.  
 
 THE LEAD:  It took an extra five minutes, but the Miami Heat defeated the Charlotte Bobcats 104-96 Saturday night at Time Warner Cable Arena. The Heat (29-11), playing without  Dwyane Wade , got 34 points from  LeBron James  and 25 points from  Chris Bosh .  Al Jefferson  led the Bobcats (17-25) with 22 points and 14 rebounds.  
 
 QUOTABLE: " It started out well for us and then we hit a rough patch. This is a good team we played and we were able to shut them down. We had a sense of urgency on both ends and got the stops we needed down the stretch. It was a well-needed win." 
 -- Miami's LeBron James 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Heat are now 24-1 when holding teams less than 100 points on the season. Their lone loss when holding an opponent under 100 was a 90-84 loss at Indiana on December 10. Miami is also 23-5 when hitting the century mark.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  Charlotte point guard  Kemba Walker  left the game with what the team described as a left ankle sprain with 7:55 to play in the third quarter and the Bobcats leading 64-57. Walker was carried off the court by teammates and did not return. Walker injured the ankle after he stepped on the foot of Bosh on a drive to the basket. There were X-rays taken at arena, which were negative. Charlotte coach  Steve Clifford  said that Walker will have an MRI done on the ankle Sunday. Walker has played in all 189 games for the franchise since being drafted by the Bobcats in 2011.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "He's going to be out for a while. I don't think they really have any idea how long." 
 -- Charlotte's  Steve   Clifford on point guard Kemba Walker 
 
 
 HOT:  Bosh has scored in 25 or more in the last three games for Miami. The Miami center had 25 points and seven rebounds in the win over Charlotte. He's averaging 25.3 points and 6.7 points in that span while shooting 58.5 percent (31-for-53) from the floor and 50.0 percent (6-for-12) from behind the arc.  
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Jefferson has been on a tear lately for Charlotte. The Bobcats center has a 22-point, 14-rebound night against Miami. Jefferson has scored at least 20 points in each of the last five games and is averaging 26.2 points, 11.4 rebounds, 1.4 steals, 2.4 assists and 1.0 blocks. He has three double-doubles in the last five games and 16 on the season. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  Tonight's attendance at Time Warner Cable Arena of 19,631 is a record for a Bobcats home game in the facility. The Bobcats also released their new Hornets merchandise for the first time at the team store. The team revealed their new brand identity on December 21 and will officially become the Charlotte Hornets at the conclusion of the 2013-14 season. James gave his sneakers to Carolina Panthers linebacker Thomas Davis after the game.  
 
 ROOKIE WATCH: Cody Zeller  saw limited minutes again. He had five points and two assists in 15 minutes of play.  
 
 NOTABLE:  The Bobcats have led the Heat by at least nine in two of their three games this season, but have not yet picked up a win ... James has scored in double figures in 534 consecutive games which ranks fourth all-time in NBA history ...  Mario Chalmers  played in his 400th career game tonight ... Miami has now hit at least one three-point field goal in 148 consecutive games ... The Bobcats dished out a season-high 31 assists on 36 field goals ... Charlotte's bench outscored the Heat's 42-24 behind 16 from  Ramon Sessions  and 11 from  Anthony Tolliver  ... The Bobcats are 1-14 when attempting fewer free throws than their opponent on the season.
