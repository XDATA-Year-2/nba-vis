  Bobcats-Suns notebook   By Mike Tulumello, for NBA.com Posted Thursday January 27, 2011 1:09AM THE FACTS:  The visiting Charlotte Bobcats continued their rise under new coach  Paul Silas  by breaking open a close game at the Phoenix Suns then hanging on for a 114-107 win Wednesday night. The Bobcats (19-25) had six players score in double figures led by  Stephen Jackson  with 23 and  Gerald Wallace  with 22.  Gerald Henderson  had a crucial 15 points off the bench. The Suns got 27 points from  Steve Nash , 22 from  Vince Carter  and 16 off the bench from  Marcin Gortat . In dropping to 20-24, they were dealt a huge blow in their attempt to keep their playoff hopes realistic. They've now lost three straight after having won five in a row. QUOTABLE:  "This was a HUGE win for us ... a critical game ... I played guys a lot of minutes after playing last night. But we had guys going good, and I didn't want to disturb that."    -- Silas, after his team recorded back-to-back road victories (they won in Sacramento Tuesday night). THE STAT:  The Bobcats got 29 free throws (they hit 25) while the Suns were awarded just 10 (they hit nine). TURNING POINT:  The Bobcats, down 79-72 midway through the third quarter, scored eight straight in less than two minutes to take an 80-79 lead. Wallace scored on a reverse layup, an alley-oop and two free throws in this span. By the end of the third period, they led 92-87. The Suns never came closer than two points (102-100 and 104-102) in the final quarter. QUOTABLE II:  "I'm sick of this losing crap."    -- Suns forward  Channing Frye  in a somber Suns locker room. HOT:  Nash was 11-for-15 for 27 points plus 15 assists with just two turnovers. NOT:   Goran Dragic , Nash's backup, continued his disappointing season, with five points on 2-for-8 shooting, plus two assists and two turnovers. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  For the Bobcats, big man  Kwame Brown  and point guard  D.J. Augustin  continue to rise under new coach Silas, who is 10-6 since taking over for  Larry Brown . Since Silas took over 16 games ago, Augustin has averaged 18.5 points on 47 percent shooting. He'd averaged 12.6 points on 42 percent shooting before that. He had 15 points and 10 assists vs. the Suns. Brown, who shot 4-for-5 for 12 points and pulled down 10 boards, has averaged 10.0 rebounds the past six games. Over the past 12 games, he's averaging 9.5 points on 60 percent shooting plus 9.2 rebounds. NOTABLE:  Carter surpassed former Suns great  Tom Chambers  for 36th place on the all-time scoring list. Chambers finished with 20,049 points. Carter entered the game with 20,046 points and, after scoring 22, now has 20,068.
