 THE FACT: Kevin Durant  sets a personal best with his eighth straight game with 30 or more points. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Thunder superstar Kevin Durant is in a zone like few others. Durant hit three 3-pointers in the last three minutes and finished with a game-high 46 points to lead Oklahoma City to a thrilling 105-97 come-from-behind win over the Portland Trail Blazers on Tuesday. 
 Meanwhile, the Thunder (32-10) defense shut down Portland (31-11), giving up just two baskets in the last 6:30 of the game. 
 Durant's first three in the closing minutes tied the game at 95 and the last of that stretch sealed the deal, putting the Thunder up by seven with less than a minute to play. 
 He finished a remarkable 17-for-25 (6-for-7 on 3-pointers). Durant's game overshadowed another huge night for Portland's  LaMarcus Aldridge,  who finished with 29 points and 16 rebounds. The Trail Blazers had four other players in double figures, with Wesley Matthews scoring 21 and Damian Lillard finishing with 14. 
 The Thunder had three other players score in double figures --  Reggie Jackson  finished with 15 points and  Derek Fisher  and  Serge Ibaka  added 10. Ibaka also had five blocks, two on consecutive shots in the last two minutes of the game. 
 Thunder center  Kendrick Perkins  also blocked a shot in that sequence and then went down and hit a rare 14-foot jumper with the game on the line to give OKC some breathing room late. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I heard people yell 'no' when he shot it, but I'll ride with Perk till the wheels fall off." 
 -- Kevin Durant on Perkins' basket with 1:36 left 
 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I thought Perk was really good tonight. He hit that big shot and played great defense on Aldridge in the fourth quarter and whaddya say about KD? We're seeing an amazing player develop before our eyes. He's an amazing young man who cares about doing the right thing. Just a great player. I love the guy." 
 -- Thunder head coach  Scott Brooks 
 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "MVP performance. To score 46 points on 25 shots, six of seven on 3s and I think he got a couple of his shots blocked. It was a remarkable performance. He made shots when they mattered. He took what was there and he made some great shots." 
 --Trail Blazers head coach  Terry Stotts 
 
 
 THE STAT:  After allowing the Blazers to shoot 57.1 percent in the first half, the Thunder locked down on defense and turned things around in the second half. Portland shot just 36.4 percent in the last 24 minutes and just 33.3 percent in the fourth quarter. At the same time, the Thunder offense kicked it in high gear shooting 55.3 percent in the second half and sizzling 68.8 percent in the fourth quarter. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Thunder waited till the end to turn things around, going on a 15-2 run to close out the game. The run began with the Thunder trailing 95-90 with 3:45 to go. The Blazers didn't score another point until just 26.8 seconds were left. Oklahoma City blocked three shots in the span of four seconds when they were leading by just two to maintain the lead. 
 
 HOT:  Portland shot 59.1 percent in the first quarter. ... Aldridge was 5-for-8 (10 points). ... Durant was 6-for-8 (15 points) in the first quarter. ...B y halftime the Trail Blazers were still shooting 57.1 percent. ... OKC had 10 offensive rebounds in the first half. ... Durant was 9-for-14 (26 points) in the second half. 
 
 NOT:  The Thunder missed their first five shots and seven of their first eight. ... OKC finished the first quarter at 38.1 percent (8-for-21). ... Ibaka was 1-for-7 (two points) in the first quarter. ... Aldridge was 1-for-8 (six points) in the fourth quarter. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The 136th consecutive sellout inside Chesapeake Energy Arena. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Both teams came into the game realizing it would likely be a tight fit one way or the other so protecting the basketball was a key for both coaches. In the first half the Thunder had just two turnovers and the Blazers just four. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  In the closing seconds of the first half  Thabo Sefolosha  took and hit an open shot to give the Thunder a one-point lead but there were still 8.3 seconds left and OKC could not stop Lillard from going all the way back down the court to hit a shot at the buzzer and give the lead back to Portland. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Thunder backup center  Steven Adams  played 17 minutes, scoring four points and pulling down six rebounds. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Durant now has the NBA's top four highest scoring games this season: 54, 48, 48 and 46 points and all four of those efforts have come in the last 10 games. ... Kevin Durant has now scored 383 total points in his last 10 games. According to Elias Sports Bureau, the last player to score at least that many points over a 10 game stretch during a single season was Kobe Bryant in March/April of 2007.
