  Hawks-Lakers notebook   By Bryan Chu, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday February 23, 2011 2:00AM THE FACTS:  Lakers coach  Phil Jackson  was right about one thing when he addressed the media pregame: No telling what you're going to get the first game back from All-Star Weekend. The Lakers came out sharp. The Hawks looked as if they were still on break. The five-day layoff did the Lakers some good as they snapped a three-game losing streak, trouncing the Hawks from start to finish 104-80 Tuesday at Staples Center. The Lakers (39-19) avoided dropping their fourth straight game for the second time this season after defeating the Hawks for the fifth straight time at Staples Center. Off his MVP All-Star performance,  Kobe Bryant  tallied a game-high 20 points on 5-for-11 shooting.  Shannon Brown  added 15 off the bench. The Lakers now head to Portland on the second of a back-to-back. With the loss, the Hawks (34-22) started their five-game road trip on a sour note. As a team, Atlanta shot 36.6 percent. The only player to shoot a respectable percentage was All-Star  Al Horford , who made 6-for-9 from the field for 13 points.  Joe Johnson  scored a team-high 14 points and  Jamal Crawford  added 12. QUOTABLE:  "We definitely need to play better basketball if we want to beat our record last year. We're going to be playing better basketball."   -- Lakers center  Andrew Bynum  on the team trying to match its 57-25 regular season record from last year. THE STAT:  29 -- The Lakers largest lead of the game. TURNING POINT:  The Lakers went on a 14-0 run late in the second quarter to lead by their biggest margin at the time, 49-27. The Hawks missed nine straight shots during the Lakers run and never recovered. QUOTABLE II:  "It's very disappointing. I thought our guys ... took the path of least resistance the whole game."   -- Hawks coach  Larry Drew . HOT:  Lakers center  Pau Gasol  tallied his 32nd double-double (14 points, 10 rebounds). Gasol was the only player to record a double-double in the contest. NOT:  Hawks forward  Josh Smith  struggled mightily. Smith went 3-for-9 shooting for seven points. He was 1-for-4 from the charity strip and committed four fouls in 27 minutes of action. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Bynum was a beast on the boards, pulling down a season-tying 15 rebounds to go with five points and three blocks in 25 minutes. NOTABLE:  Lakers guard  Derek Fisher  scored the game's first six points after hitting three straight jumpers. He also led the Lakers with 10 points in the first half, but didn't score in the second half...The Lakers made 12-for-18 from the field in the first quarter and opened up a 28-15 advantage at the end of one. They closed the second quarter on a 19-6 run to go up 54-33 at halftime...The Hawks missed 14 of 15 shots from deep...Los Angeles had a 54-32 rebound advantage and connected on 34-for-40 from the free throw line to the 19-for-28 by Atlanta.
