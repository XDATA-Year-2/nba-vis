  Notebook: Hawks 101, Wizards 83   By Matt Winkeljohn, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday December 28, 2011 11:39PM THE FACTS:  The Hawks made five of their first six shots and Washington missed 10 of its first 11 to set a tone and  Joe Johnson  scored 18 points and  Marvin Williams  added 17 to lead Atlanta to its second straight wire-to-wire win as the host Hawks trounced the Wizards 101-83. Reserve guard  Nick Young  led Washington (0-2) with 21 points, but made just one of his last seven shots.  John Wall  scored 20 points, but he made 6-for-15, forward  Andray Blatche  hit just 2-for-13 and former Hawk  Jordan Crawford  missed all six of his shots. Atlanta (2-0) dominated on the boards, where  Josh Smith  and  Al Horford  each grabbed 10 to help the Hawks build a 45-32 edge. QUOTABLE:  "There were parts of the game where we lacked defensive intensity. I win is a win; they're not all going to be pretty."   -- Hawks coach  Larry Drew . THE STAT:  35.7 percent. The Wizards did not often enough take advantage of scoring opportunities in the paint. Although they were outscored by a modest 36-30 margin there, the Wizards made just 15-for-42 shots from within the lane (35.7 percent) while the Hawks made 18-for-28 (64.3 percent) on the other end. TURNING POINT:  After trailing 19-4 in the first quarter and 55-42 at halftime, the Wizards cut the Atlanta lead to 57-49 early in the second half before their hopes faded over the next six minutes. Crawford and  JaVale McGee  missed point-blank shots and Washington turned the ball over three times in that span while while the Hawks went on a 17-6 spurt. Atlanta's lead never fell below 13 points after that. QUOTABLE II:  "We're searching for that main group because we're not playing well together."    -- Washington coach  Flip Saunders . HOT:  Before scoring 17 points and grabbing eight rebounds Wednesday night, Williams scored 14 points with nine rebounds in just 22 minutes in Tuesday's season opener at New Jersey. He had back surgery in June to relieve a problem that's been bother him for a couple seasons. Williams leads the Hawks so far with an average of 15.5 points and 8.5 rebounds per game, and an average of 28.7 points per 48 minutes. He's also averaging 15.7 rebounds, 4.6 assists and 3.7 steals per 48, and has made 4-for-7 3-pointers. . . . Horford has not turned the ball over in two games. . . . Young, who replaced ineffective starting shooting guard Crawford for 15 straight minutes in the first half, made his first five shots and after scoring 16 points in 17 minutes in Washington's season-opening loss to New Jersey, he leads the Wizards with 18.5 points per game. . . . McGee had a double-double with 15 points and 12 rebounds, and is averaging 13 and nine. NOT:  Blatche missed all seven of his shots in the first half, and is shooting 26.9 percent (7-for-18) through two games. . . . Wall is shooting 32.1 percent (9-for-28), and is averaging five turnovers per game for Washington. He had six Wednesday. . . . QUOTABLE III:  " I've got my body in better shape, and I feel better. I was never going to make excuses, but my back was bothering me the last two or three years. I had a discectomy [June 8]. Basically, I had a disk pressing up against a nerve and it was making my leg numb. A lot of times I would be out there, and my leg would just start tingling. Man, [the NBA lockout] was a blessing for me. A lot of other guys wouldn't say that, but having that much time to get healthy really helped."    -- Marvin Williams. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Recently retired NBA center  Shaquille O'Neal  was at the game. . . . Atlanta Falcons cornerback  Brent Grimes  and his wife were in attendance. ROOKIE WATCH:  Washington forward  Chris Singleton , who grew up in metro Atlanta, made 3-for-4 and scored seven points with four rebounds and two steals off the bench. Saunders said Singleton has earned additional playing time for his ability to play multiple positions and because he's so active. . . . Wizards guard  Shelvin Mack  missed all five of his shots, and has missed all seven in two games. NOTABLE:  Hawks coach Larry Drew gave his team Thursday off as a reward to winning back-to-back games in as many nights without trailing. Atlanta has not trailed this season after winning 107-70 Tuesday at New Jersey. UP NEXT:  For the Wizards, Friday @ Bucks, Sunday vs. Celtics, Monday @ Celtics. For the Hawks, Friday vs. Nets, Saturday @ Rockets, Monday @ Heat.
