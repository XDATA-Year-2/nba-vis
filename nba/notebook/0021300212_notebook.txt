 THE FACT: John Wall  had 30-plus points for the third consecutive game -- and  Nene  had a career-high 30 points. It's the first time in Wall's career he's had three consecutive games of 30 or more. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Wall's 31 points and Nene's 30 led the Washington Wizards to a 116-111 win over the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday night. 
 Wall had 11 points in the game's final 4:40 to seal the win for the Wizards, who are now 6-8.  Martell Webster  added 20 points including four 3-pointers. 
 
 Jordan Farmar  scored a season-high 22 to lead the Lakers, who had a three-game winning streak snapped.  Pau Gasol  had 17. 
 
 QUOTABLE:   "I feel like wine. You get old. You get better." 
 
 -- Nene on his first 30-point game in the 12th year of his career 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Wall and Nene were the first Wizards teammates to score 30 or more in the same game since  Gilbert Arenas  and  Antawn Jamison  did it on Dec. 16, 2009.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  Wall took control late in the game and his growth has been evident so far this season.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It's just put together and we don't have one thing that we go to all the time, but we'll get it straight. They're playing hard and they're together and we should have won tonight." 
 
 -- Lakers coach  Mike D'Antoni  on playing without  Kobe Bryant 
 
 
 HOT:  Wall has scored 37, 31 and 31 points in his last three games. He was rewarded on Monday by being named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week. "I've been more consistent, just being who I am," Wall said. 
 
 NOT:  Los Angeles forward  Shawne Williams  is 2-for-13 over the last two games.  
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Even without the injured  Bradley Beal , who'll miss at least the next two weeks with a stress injury to his right leg, coach  Randy Wittman  played just nine players. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Both teams shot well. The Lakers hit on 53 percent, the Wizards, 52.9 percent. "There wasn't a lot of defense played in the game," Wittman said. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Bryant hasn't set a date for his return, but spoke publicly for the first time on his contract extension.  
 
 IN THE ARENA:  Bryant wasn't. He watched the game on TV in Los Angeles' locker room.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Lakers: Wednesday @ Brooklyn, Friday @ Detroit, Sunday vs. Portland. For the Wizards: Wednesday @ Milwaukee, Friday @ Indiana, Saturday vs. Atlanta
