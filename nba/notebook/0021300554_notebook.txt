 THE FACT:  The Spurs have won four straight games, seven of their last eight, and have taken a full-game lead over Oklahoma City and Portland for the best record in the Western Conference after beating the Timberwolves on Sunday. 
 
 THE LEAD: Kawhi Leonard  scored 17 points,  Tim Duncan  added 15 and  Tony Parker  came in with 14 points and 10 assists as the San Antonio Spurs defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 104-86 at AT&T Center. 
 The Spurs (29-8) shot 56 percent without  Manu Ginobili , who sat out a second straight game with left hamstring tightness.  Matt Bonner , however, came off the bench with 14 points after hitting his first four shots from the 3-point line. 
 
 Nikola Pekovic  had his second straight game with big offensive numbers, 10-for-15 from the floor for 22 points (he was 10-for-14 for 26 points two night ago against Charlotte). But  Kevin Love  was limited to 14 points off 3-for-12 shooting, and he missed his usual double-double with seven rebounds. 
 The Timberwolves (18-19) failed to break the .500 mark for their ninth-straight attempt. They haven't had a winning record since they were 8-7 on Nov. 23. Overall on Sunday they shot 35 percent from the floor. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "(Love) definitely got our attention, if nothing else. We knew we wanted to keep hinm off that 3-point line, especially. Those guys (defending Love) did a great job of staying up in his chest and not letting him get clean shots off."  --  Duncan 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Spurs shot almost 57 percent from the floor (42-for-74). Here's their shooting percentage by quarters: 57.9, 58.8, 61.1 and 50 percent. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Spurs had a 3-point lead with 3 ½ minutes left in the third quarter but outscored the Wolves 10-3 to close out the quarter with a 10-point lead. Minnesota failed to cut the lead to less than double digits the rest of the way. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "(The Spurs) were very physical with Kevin Love, everywhere he moved. We have to figure out a way to help him out a little bit, see if we can't have an answer for that."  --  Minnesota coach  Rick Adelman 
 
 
 HOT:  Bonner has seen his minutes decrease each of the past four season -- from 21 minutes per game in 2010-11 to 13 minutes last season and 11 this season. He played less than eight minutes in two straight games last week. But with  Tiago Splitter  out of the lineup Bonner has played more than 15 minutes in each of the past two games and has hit from the 3-point line in each game. He hit his first four 3-pointers and was 5-for-10 overall. 
 
 NOT:  Love's 3-for-14 performance wasn't as bad as two games back. He shot 4-for-20 for days ago against Phoenix. The Wolves lost both games against two teams with winning records. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Parker (14 points, 10 rebounds) had his first double-double of the season. He's come close, the last time being Jan. 4 against the Clippers when he had 17 points and nine assists. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  With Splitter out with a right shoulder sprain injury that's expected to keep him out for the next two weeks at least,  Boris Diaw  is reminding people of his effectiveness as a one-on-one defender. In consecutive games as the primary defender against  Dirk Nowitzki  and Love, he's held those two All-Stars to 6-for-26 from the floor. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH: Gorgui Dieng  played almost four minutes of garbage time for Minnesota late in the game. He had two steals and a rebound. 
 
 NOTABLE: Danny Green  left the game early in the second quarter with a sprain of his left index finger; he returned with the finger taped, but did not re-enter the game. ... Pekovic has not missed a free throw since Jan. 4; he's 15-for-15 since then including 2-for-2 Sunday. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Timberwolves, Wednesday vs. Sacramento, Friday @ Toronto, Saturday vs. Utah. For the Spurs, Monday @ New Orleans, Wednesday vs. Utah, Friday vs. Portland.
