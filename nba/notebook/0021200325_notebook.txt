 THE FACTS:  The Toronto Raptors (5-19) got a desperately-needed win defeating the Dallas Mavericks (11-12) 95-74 at the Air Canada Centre on Friday night. The Raptors snapped a six-game losing streak, winning only their second game of their last 14. Toronto was led by their bench with  Linas Kleiza 's 20 points and rookie  Terrence Ross ' 18 points. Starters  DeMar DeRozan  and  Jose Calderon  each added 14 points, with the Raptors' bench outscoring the Mavericks' 53-27. 
 With a 54-41 Raptors lead going into halftime, both teams played evenly in the third quarter, yet shot poorly from the floor at 26.3 percent (Raptors) and 21.1 percent (Mavericks). However, the home team came out with an 18-6 run to start the fourth quarter, pushing the score to 87-61 and getting as much as a 29 point lead to take the game, winning their third out of their last 18 meetings with the Mavericks. 
 Dallas was led by  Chris Kaman 's 15 points and  Shawn Marion 's double-double of 12 points and 13 rebounds. Mavericks leading scorer  O.J. Mayo  was held to 10 points on 2-for-8 shooting from the field. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "We got to get back to defensive fundamentals and principles, and that's on me. I got away from it, but from now on it's going to be about that. Closing out to touch, and multiple efforts, and we got that tonight." 
 -- Raptors coach  Dwane Casey 
 
 
 THE STAT : While defense was key, 3-point shooting was telling in this game. The Raptors shot 12-for-33 from behind the arc (36.4 percent), tying a season high. The Mavericks shot 0-for-13, marking the first time in 1,108 games that Dallas failed to make a 3-pointer. 
 
 TURNING POINT : The Raptors inability to close out games has haunted them all season, however, their 20-8 run to start the second quarter put them ahead with a lead that was never in jeopardy and stretched out to as much as 29 points.  
 
 QUOTABLE II : "It's definitely a relief. Now we have the confidence to go out there and settle and focus ... and play like that every night." 
 -- Raptors guard Terrance Ross 
 
 HOT : Raptors rookie Ross checked into the game for the first time at the start of the second quarter and scored 11 points in the first five minutes on 4-for-6 shooting in the quarter, helping take the Raptors from a 25-24 first quarter to a 54-41 lead going into halftime. 
 
 NOT : Mayo didn't shoot well and also had six turnovers in the game. Despite leading the league in 3-point shots made, he went 0-for-4 from the line and didn't make his first field goal until their was 1:08 left in the third quarter on a driving layup. 
 
 NOTABLE : The Mavericks were still without  Dirk Nowitzki  who is recovering from right knee surgery. The Raptors were missing  Andrea Bargnani  (strained right wrist),  Kyle Lowry  (partial tear in right triceps) and  Landry Fields  (right elbow). The Mavericks streak of 1,108 consecutive games with a 3-point shot made was snapped as they shot 0-for-13 tonight. Former Raptor  Vince Carter  returned to Toronto and was booed incessantly each time he touched the ball. The Mavericks turned over the ball 17 times leading to 26 Raptors' points. The Mavericks are now 0-2 on their three-game road trip; they are 4-9 on the road all season.  
 
 UP NEXT : For the Raptors, Sunday vs. Houston, Tuesday @ Cleveland, Wednesday vs. Detroit. For the Mavericks, Saturday @ Minnesota, Tuesday vs. Philadelphia and Thursday vs. Miami.
