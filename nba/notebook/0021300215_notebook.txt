 THE FACT:  The Indiana Pacers held the Charlotte Bobcats to a season low in scoring en route to winning their fifth straight game. 
 
 THE LEAD: C.J. Watson  hit a career-best six 3-pointers and scored a season-high 18 points as the Pacers rode a big fourth quarter to a 99-74 victory over the Bobcats on Wednesday night at Time Warner Cable Arena. 
 
 Paul George  and  Lance Stephenson  added 15 points each,  Roy Hibbert  14 and  David West  11 for Indiana (14-1), which shot less than 30 percent over the first three quarters before erupting for 39 points in the final period. 
 Hibbert and Stephenson also had 10 rebounds each, as the Pacers finished with a 57-43 advantage on the boards. 
 
 Al Jefferson  scored 16 points,  Kemba Walker  15 and  Gerald Henderson  10 for Charlotte (7-9), which shot a season-low 18.2 percent in the first quarter and 31.3 percent for the game against the Pacers. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I was just trying to get comfortable and find a rhythm. Lance or [George] would find me in transition, and I started knocking them down. I thought the game was getting a little close, and I thought that if I could knock down a couple 3s, it would break the game open."  
 
 -- C.J. Watson 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The 74 points by the Bobcats was their lowest-scoring game of the still-young season, worse than the 81 points they scored in road loss to the Chicago Bulls 10 days earlier (Nov. 18). 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Pacers shot just 28.1 percent from the field over the first three quarters against Charlotte's third-ranked scoring defense. But with Watson providing a spark, Indiana shot 70 percent (14-for-20) and went 7-for-9 3-pointers in the fourth quarter. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "That was Pacers style -- in our offensive balance, we've had different guys stepping up each night, and we've been dominating with our defense and rebounding. ... You have to account for everybody on our team. That's a valuable commodity to have, and it's a neat identity for us."  
 
 -- Indiana coach  Frank Vogel 
 
 
 HOT:  With Indiana leading by just eight points with less than 11 minutes remaining, Watson hit five straight 3-pointers during a 28-11 run that pushed the Pacers' lead 91-66 -- their biggest of the game -- with 3:10 left in the final period. 
 
 NOT:  Walker had his fifth straight double-figure game and 13th this season, but he shot 3-for-17 from the field. Ditto for Henderson, whose seventh straight double-figure game and 14th this season came on 3-for-15 from the field. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "In the third quarter, we got off to a rough start and we battled back to where we needed to be, but in the fourth quarter we dropped the ball. We made a lot of mistakes, and every time we made a mistake they made us pay. With a team like that, you can't do that. It's a learning experience."  
 
 -- Bobcats coach  Steve Clifford 
 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Bobcats forward  Cody Zeller  finished with seven points, and had six rebounds and two assists in 19 minutes. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The 74 points scored by the Bobcats also equaled the season low allowed by Indiana's defense, and was the fourth time this season the Pacers -- who lead the NBA in scoring defense -- had held an opponent to under 80 points. 
 
 NOTABLE II:  Indiana finished the game shooting 38.1 percent from the field, but that was not the worst performance this season. That happened seven days earlier, when the Pacers shot 37.9 percent in beating the New York Knicks 103-96 on Nov. 20.
