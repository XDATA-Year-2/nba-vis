  Notebook: Bucks 105, Heat 97   By Rick Braun, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday February 1, 2012 11:58PM THE FACTS: Brandon Jennings  scored 31 points, including consecutive 3-pointers to cap a 22-3 run to start the fourth quarter, as the Milwaukee Bucks overcame an 18-point deficit to beat the Miami Heat 105-97 Wednesday night at the Bradley Center. The Bucks (10-11) won for the sixth time in eight games and beat Miami for the second time in 10 days. Those two losses are the only ones in a 10-game span for the Heat, who fell to 16-6. LeBron James  led all scorers with 40 points for the Heat, 24 of them in the first quarter when the Heat built a 40-23 lead.  Dwyane Wade  added 23. But James and Wade seemed to go into one-on-one mode more in the second half, as Milwaukee held a 58-37 advantage after intermission. QUOTABLE:  "I think it's good for us when they try to go one-on-one. The other part of that, though, is that they're very, very good players and you can get exposed that way. But the good thing is when you're able to stop them it gets the other guys around them frustrated and it slows down their momentum."   -- Milwaukee's  Luc Richard Mbah a Moute  on the challenge of stopping James and Wade one-on-one THE STAT:  The game turned in the first 7 1/2 minutes of the fourth quarter because the Heat, which shot 82.4 percent (14-for-17) in the first quarter and 60 percent (21-for-35) in the half, made just one of their first 12 shots while being outscored, 22-3. Wade went 0-for-4, James 0-for-2 and Chris Bosh 1-for-4 in that span. TURNING POINT:  The Bucks already had shaved an 18-point first-half lead down to 79-76 after three when they exploded out of the fourth-quarter gate with a 22-3 blitz over the first 7:35. Jennings capped the flurry with consecutive 3-pointers to make it 98-82 with 4:25 left. QUOTABLE II:  "You always have to find a balance with that. We're trying to find a balance where we can take advantage of our guys' strengths of ability to attack and ability to break down the defense. At the same time, we have to do it collectively, and the ball has to move."   -- Miami coach  Erik Spoelstra , when asked if there was too much one-on-one play by his team in the fourth quarter HOT:  Known as a great defensive player -- and he did some great work on that end of the floor -- Milwaukee Mbah a Moute was 6-for-7 on the offensive end to finish with 13 points. NOT:  Miami's four reserves that played --  Udonis Haslem, Shane Battier, Norris Cole  and  Mike Miller  -- combined to go 2-for-11 for just seven points. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  James' 40-point night also included eight rebounds and five assists. GOOD MOVE:  Although his team was whipped in every category in the first half, Bucks coach  Scott Skiles ' intermission speech pointed out that they were only down 13 (60-47). Skiles stressed playing with energy, and his team responded with probably its best half of the season. ROOKIE WATCH:  Bucks second-round pick  Jon Leuer  only played 1:33 but went 1-for-1 and had an assist in the first half. NOTABLE:  After not playing in the previous two games -- one because of a suspension and one because of coach's decision --  Stephen Jackson  reported into the game in the first quarter when  Carlos Delfino  picked up his second foul. ... The Heat began a span of eight games of their next 10 on the road. During that span, Miami will return to the Bradley Center on Feb. 13. ... Although he had just a 9-for-24 shooting night, Jennings made seven of 14 3-pointers. UP NEXT:  For the Heat, Friday @ Philadelphia, Sunday vs. Toronto, Tuesday vs. Cleveland. For the Bucks, Friday @ Detroit, Saturday vs. Chicago, Tuesday vs. Phoenix.
