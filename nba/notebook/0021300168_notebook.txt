 THE FACT:   Chris Paul  scored 13 points in a row and 16 of the final 21 points by Los Angeles. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Paul had 20 points and 11 assists to set a new NBA record for consecutive double-doubles to start a season with 12. Paul also provided several key buckets down the stretch as the Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 102-98 on Wednesday night.  
 Los Angeles started fast in both of the first two quarters, opening the first quarter with a 12-0 run and the second with a 11-0 run.  But Minnesota was able to respond and tie the game 24-24 at the end of the first quarter and 46-46 at the end of the first half.   
 
 Blake Griffin  asserted himself in the third quarter, scoring 14 of his 20 points, and helping the Clippers build a double-digit lead.  But after Minnesota clawed their way back into the game, it was  Chris Paul  who stepped up in the waning minutes of the game.  He scored 13 points in a row and 16 of his 20 points in the final 5:08 of the game.    
 
 Kevin Martin  led the Timberwolves with 28 points and 10 rebounds.  He scored 15 points in the fourth quarter and for a while was able to match Paul basket for basket.   
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It's a tough loss.  Chris Paul took over in the fourth quarter and made a lot of big plays.  Our guys battled, but there were too many spurts by them.  Too many spurts at the start of the game, at the start of the second quarter, at the end of the second quarter.  They had these spurts where they go up ten.  It's hard to come back from that." 
 -- Minnesota coach  Rick Adelman 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Just as they did in their earlier meeting this year, the Clippers bench played a key role, outscoring Minnesota's bench 32-18.  In their last meeting, November 11 in Los Angeles, the Clipper's outscored Minnesota's bench 40-17, and  Jamal Crawford  outscored Minnesota's entire bench.  Tonight, Crawford's 16 was just a bit behind Minnesota's entire bench. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  After a closely fought first half, the Clippers used a 19-6 run to build a double-digit lead, a lead that they never relinquished. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "That's who [Paul] is.  He's one of the best players in the league.  He's capable of doing that [taking over a game].  And it was good that he was doing that.  He saw that we were struggling and missing shots and you've got to go for it.  Rick [Adelman] did a great job of putting  Corey [Brewer]  on  Jamal [Crawford] .  It's tough to get the ball with Corey Brewer around.  CP was our answer." 
 -- Clippers coach  Doc Rivers 
 
 
 HOT:   Nikola Pekovic  had another efficient night, scoring 20 points on 9-for-13 shooting. 
 
 NOT:   Kevin Love  struggled to make a shot all night, going 2-for-14 from the floor (including 0-for-3 from beyond the arc) and scoring only 10 points.  But he grabbed 12 rebounds and had eight assists. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Blake Griffin  was named Western Conference Player of the Week for November 11-17.  He led the Clippers to a 3-0 record, averaging 25.7 ppg, 11.3 rpg, and 4.7 apg.  He leads the NBA with 162 points in the paint. ...  Ryan Hollins  and  DeAndre Jordan  were both assessed flagrant fouls for the Clippers. ... The Clippers have now won the last seven games in the series, including the last four at the Target Center. 
 
 UP NEXT:   For Minnesota, Friday vs. Houston, Saturday at Houston, Monday at Indiana.  For the Clippers, Thursday at Oklahoma City, Saturday vs. Sacramento, Sunday vs. Chicago.
