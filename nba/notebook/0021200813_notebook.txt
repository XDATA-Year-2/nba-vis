 THE FACTS : The Bulls defeated the Charlotte Bobcats 105-75 with a well-rounded performance Friday night at Time Warner Cable Arena. Eight Chicago players scored in double figures with  Taj Gibson  leading the way with 17 points.  Kemba Walker  scored 27 points for the Bobcats to lead all scorers.  
 
 QUOTABLE : "When everybody is on the same page, defensively, we're a whole different team. We were aggressive form the start of the game and it really set the tone. We were able to get stops, get defensive rebounds and run in transition and get going." 
 -- Chicago center  Joakim Noah 
 
 
 THE STAT : Chicago (32-23) made an impressive turn around in the assists and turnover categories Friday night in Charlotte. The Bulls had 37 assists on 42 made baskets and committed just six turnovers, which were converted into only seven points. Comparatively, the Bobcats (13-42) had 13 assists on 25 made baskets and committed 13 turnovers, which were turned into 21 points. In Chicago's loss Thursday night they had 20 assists on 28 baskets with 27 turnovers which resulted in 24 points. 
 
 TURNING POINT : Chicago controlled most of Friday's game, but really pulled away to start the second quarter. The Bulls used a 16-4 run to blow open the game.  Marco Belinelli  and Gibson combined for 14 of the 16 points in the run as the Bulls took a 40-19 lead after the first five minutes of the quarter. The Bulls were 7-for-8 in that stretch while the Bobcats were just 1-for-9. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "We were disappointed in the way we played last night and we felt that we beat ourselves yesterday and we wanted to correct that. The important thing was the way we approached today. You can use the outs of a back-to-back and getting late, but instead we chose to work and came out ready, got the lead early and played well." 
 -- Chicago coach  Tom Thibodeau 
 
 
 HOT : The Bulls had a well-rounded team effort Friday, but Noah's first half was a strong one. He scored eight points, had five rebounds, four assists and three blocked shots while connecting on 4-for-5 shot attempts. He finished the game with 10 points, eight rebounds, eight assists, three blocks and a steal. 
 
 NOT: Byron Mullens  had been on a tear for the Bobcats since returning to the lineup on Feb. 4, but that came to a screaming halt Friday. Mullens was 1-for-12 from the floor and missed all four of his 3-point attempts and finished with only two points. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT : Walker was the lone bright spot for the Bobcats. He finished the game with 27 points and five rebounds -- a shooting night which saw him make 9-for-17 from the floor, 4-for-6 from behind the arc and connect on all five free-throw attempts. Walker is averaging 25.0 points in his last three games. This is Walker's second time in his career in which he has had three straight 20-point games. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH: Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  was one of only two Charlotte players in double figures with 10. He added seven assists and a steal in a losing effort. It was his 24th time in double figures this season.  Marquis Teague  is the lone rookie for the Bulls, and he played 24 minutes with four points, four assists and three rebounds.  
 
 NOTABLE : Between the two teams there were a total of 28 players at the game. Of that group, 13 players represented four schools (Duke, 4; Connecticut, 4; Kentucky 3; Ohio State, 2). ...The Bulls have won each of the last four games in Charlotte by at least 27 points with the average margin of victory at 30.0 points. ... Bulls forward  Carlos Boozer  recorded his fourth straight double-double and 28th of the season. ...  Luol Deng  scored in double figures for the 45th time this season, while  Nate Robinson  accomplished that feat for the 34th time this season and Noah the 33rd time. Eight different Bulls scored in double figures for the first time since a 132-92 win over the Sacramento Kings in March 2011. ...This was the 10th loss by 20 or more points this season for Charlotte. ...  Ben Gordon  did not play for the first time this season when on the active roster. He's averaged 12.4 points in 21.6 minutes this season.
