  Magic-Blazers notebook   By Kerry Eggers, for NBA.com Posted Friday December 10, 2010 2:14AM THE FACTS:   Andre Miller  and  Wesley Matthews  teamed up to lead Portland to a 97-83 victory over Orlando, which received a season-high 39 points from  Dwight Howard . Miller and Matthews combined for 42 points as the Blazers rallied from a 14-point second-quarter deficit. QUOTABLE:  "We've played good basketball. We've made plays, we've made shots. Is it as simple as making shots? Yes. You give yourself a chance to win."   -- Blazers coach  Nate McMillan  on Portland's three-game winning streak after losing six in a row before that. THE STAT:  Howard scored Orlando's first 12 points and 18 of its 22 in the first quarter. Howard, whose career high is 45, had 26 at halftime but the Magic led only 46-45. TURNING POINT:  Ahead 67-62 after three quarters, the Blazers started the fourth period with a 15-7 spurt that put the game away. QUOTABLE II:  "He played with a chip on his shoulder tonight, and he had a couple of days rest. I'm sure that was good for his legs. He was the floor general out there. He penetrated and he finished."   -- Blazers assistant coach  Buck Williams  on Miller's performance after returning to the lineup following a one-game suspension. HOT:  Miller collected 22 points on 9-for-15 shooting to go with seven rebounds and eight assists in 38 minutes. NOT:  The Magic, other than Howard. Howard was 13-for-20 from the field, his teammates a collective 17-for-51. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Howard had 15 rebounds and three blocked shots along with his 39 points. A 54 percent foul shooter, he even made 13-for-18 at the line. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Portland announced attendance at 20,219, keeping its sellout streak of 125 games. But there were rows of open seats throughout the arena -- especially in the upper deck. GOOD MOVE:  Twice  Marcus Camby , working the perimeter, fed lobs to  LaMarcus Aldridge , once for a layup, once for a dunk. BAD MOVE:  Orlando coach  Stan Van Gundy  went long minutes (33) with  Vince Carter , hoping the veteran guard would get going. He never did, making 2-for-12 shots. NOTABLE:  Orlando entered the game shooting .362 from 3-point range, but was only 6-for-22 (.273) from beyond the arc. UP NEXT:  For the Blazers, at Phoenix Friday, at San Antonio Sunday, at Memphis Monday. For the Magic, at Utah Friday, at L.A. Clippers Sunday, at Denver Tuesday.
