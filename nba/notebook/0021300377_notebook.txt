 THE FACT:  Memphis became the first team with at least 22 offensive rebounds to record more offensive than defensive rebounds in a game since Seattle did it on Feb. 15, 1994 against the 76ers. 
 
 THE LEAD: Dirk Nowitzki  scored 20 points and  Monta Ellis  chipped in 18, 16 of which came in the second half, to lead the Dallas Mavericks to a 105-91 win over a shorthanded Memphis squad Wednesday night at the American Airlines Center. 
 Dallas (15-10) prevailed despite being outscored in the paint 54-36 and allowing Memphis (10-15) to pull down a whopping 22 offensive rebounds. The Mavericks were able to get to the free-throw line at will, attempting 23 shots from the charity stripe while the Grizzlies attempted just 14. 
 Memphis was playing without starters  Mike Conley  (left thigh contusion) and  Tayshaun Prince  (knee) and it showed, as the Grizzlies struggled to generate offense all night.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We're in a situation where we're one of six or seven teams fighting for two or three playoff spots. That's what it's going to come down to. Concentration and focus and attention to detail are going to carry the day as to who gets in and who has a chance to advance." --Mavericks coach  Rick Carlisle 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Tony Allen  tied a career-high with 11 boards and became the first guard with 10 offensive rebounds in a game since  Bonzi Wells  had 10 for the Kings on March 17, 2006. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Trailing 65-49 early in the third quarter, Memphis rattled off a 13-1 run to cut Dallas' advantage to just four points. The Mavericks answered right back with a 12-4 run of its own to push the lead back to double digits.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I thought we played really hard, it's just hard to play from behind. They got out in front of us in the first quarter and we kind of chased them the rest of the night." --Grizzlies coach  David Joerger 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  After not playing in Dallas' win over Milwaukee on Saturday,  Samuel Dalember t was inserted into the lineup in the second half and proved to be an energizer, scoring eight points, grabbing seven boards and blocking two shots in just 13 minutes. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  In addition to his game-high 20 points, Nowitzki filled up the stat sheet with six rebounds, five assists, two steals and a blocked shot. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Grizzlies are now 0-7 against the Southwest division. ... Memphis has lost five straight games for the first time since Nov. 10-19, 2010 and has dropped nine out of its last 12 contests since  Marc Gasol  went down with an injury. ... Dallas improved its record to 4-0 when holding opponents under 40-percent shooting. ... Allen sustained a cut to his left hand that required three stitches after the game. He hopes to play Saturday against the Knicks. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Friday vs. Raptors, Saturday @ Phoenix, Monday @ Rockets. For the Grizzlies, Saturday @ Knicks, Monday vs. Jazz, Thursday @ Rockets.
