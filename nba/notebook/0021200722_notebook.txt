 THE FACTS:  Six players scored in double figures as the Washington Wizards broke the New  York Knicks' five-game winning streak 106-96 on Wednesday night. 
 
 John Wall  led the Wizards with 21 points.  Trevor Ariza  had 20,  Martell Webster  had 19,  Nene  had 13,  Emeka Okafor  added 12 and  Chris Singleton  had 10. 
 The Knicks, who had a 10-game winning streak against Washington broken, were led by  Carmelo Anthony  with 31.  Amar'e Stoudemire  had 19 and  Raymond Felton  scored 17. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I'd like to play our best against everyone."  
 -- Wizards coach  Randy Wittman 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Washington shot 68.4 percent in the fourth quarter and they outscored New York 36-23 in the fourth quarter. It was the Wizards' best fourth quarter of the season. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Ariza had a four-point play to give Washington a 74-73 lead 20 seconds into the fourth quarter, and the Wizards never again trailed. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:    "We were just there thinking we were going to show up and come out of here with a win, and it just didn't happen. It was awful across the boards, starting at the top with me. We've got to be better."  
 -- New York coach  Mike Woodson 
 
 
 HOT:  Ariza was 7-for-11 including 5-for-7 from 3-point range. Webster was 5-for-9. 
 
 NOT:  All four of  Jason Kidd 's field-goal attempts were from 3-point range. He missed them.  
 
 GOOD MOVE:   Wittman putting Ariza on Anthony. "He made Carmelo work for 31," Wittman said. 
 
 BAD MOVE:   The Knicks had no answer for Wall, who played in front of his college coach  John Calipari  and  Magic Johnson . 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Wizards have beaten five of the six division leaders, New York, Miami, Oklahoma City, the Los Angeles Clippers and Chicago, which was leading the Central when Washington played them on Jan. 26.  
 
 IN THE ARENA:  Among the 18,263 fans at Verizon Center were thousands of Knicks fans. "I forgot what city I was in a couple of times," Okafor said.   
 
 UP NEXT:   For the Knicks, Friday @ Minnesota, Sunday vs. L.A. Clippers, Feb. 13 vs. Toronto. For the Wizards, Friday vs. Brooklyn,  Monday @ Minnesota, Wednesday @ Detroit.
