 THE FACT:   The Raptors have won eight of their last 11 and at 14-15 are one game under .500 for the first time since they were 6-7 on Nov. 22.     
 
 THE LEAD:   Jonas Valanciunas  led a balanced Toronto scoring attack with 15 points and the visiting Raptors defeated the Bulls 85-79 at a relatively empty and quiet United Center on Tuesday.  Kyle Lowry  had 13 points for the Raptors. In his first game back after missing five games with an Achilles injury,  Luol Deng  led the Bulls with 16 points, and  Joakim Noah  pulled down 16 rebounds.     
 
 THE FACTS II:  The Bulls watched a five-point lead after three quarters turn into a 12-point deficit in the fourth quarter as they shot less than 17 percent (4 for 24) in the fourth quarter. The Raptors, meanwhile, shot 59 percent (10 for 17) in the fourth quarter. 
 
 QUOTABLE I:  "These are the kinds of games you have to win if you are serious about being a playoff team.'' 
 -- Toronto coach  Dwane Casey 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Bulls' starting interior players  Joakim Noah  and  Carlos Boozer  were a combined 3 for 18 from the field. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We have to finish strong. We can't just flip the ball up there.'' 
 -- Bulls coach  Tom Thibodeau  on the team's interior shooting 
 
 
 THE STAT II:  The Raptors' top three bench contributors --  Greivis Vasquez ,  John Salmons  and  Patrick Patterson  -- shot 50 percent (12 for 24) from the field. They also contributed nine rebounds and seven assists with just three turnovers. 
 
 THE STAT III:  At halftime, the Bulls' bench had 25 of the team's 42 points, led by  Taj Gibson  with 10 points. Gibson finished with 12 points.  
 
 TURNING POINT:   The Bulls led 60-52 with 2:16 left in the third quarter, but the Raptors went on a 26-6 run to take a 78-66 lead with 4:47 left in the game.  
 
 STAT IV:  The Raptors made more free throws (23 for 31) than the Bulls attempted (17 for 21).  
 
 INJURY UPDATE:   Luol Deng  played for the first time in six games after sitting out with a sore Achilles. He played 33 minutes and went 6 for 15 from the field with four rebounds but also had a game-high four turnovers.       
 
 LINEUP NEWS:  Tuesday was only the second game this season the Bulls have played with their "full strength'' lineup of Deng, Hinrich, Butler, Boozer and Noah. They are 1-1 with that lineup, which became their "full strength'' list when  Derrick Rose  got injured in Portland in late November. They played eight games with Rose starting in place of Hinrich and went 5-3.   
 
 HOT:  The Raptors are 7-3 since the Dec. 9 trade that sent  Rudy Gay  and two others to Sacramento for Vasquez, Salmons and Patterson.  
 
 
 NOT:  Bulls guard  Kirk Hinrich  went 1-for-9 from the field and is shooting just 33.7 percent from the field this season. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "The guys in the locker room believe in each other and what we can do." 
 -- Lowry 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:   D.J. Augustin 's move from Toronto to the Bulls has certainly worked out for both the player and the new team. After being waived by Toronto Dec. 9, Augustin has been a key contributor to the Bulls, who have needed help at point guard since the season-ending injury to Rose. Augustin went 3-for-4 from the field Tuesday and had three assists with no turnovers in 20 minutes.      
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  Where was everybody? A predicted 3-6 inch snowfall and New Year's Eve combined to attract a crowd estimated at about half of capacity through the first half, although the Bulls announced a sellout crowd of 21,507.  
 
 NOTABLE:  For three of their next four games, the Raptors play the Central Division-leading Indiana Pacers twice, and the Southeast Division-leading Miami Heat once... The Raptors are now 9-7 on the road, and have a better road record than home mark (where they are 5-8).... The Raptors have been in the league 19 years and have never had a winning road record at the end of a season... the Raptors have played only 13 home games, and only the Washington Wizards have less home games with 12... the Bulls are 6-15 since Rose got injured...      
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Bulls, Thursday vs. Boston, Saturday vs. Atlanta, Tuesday vs. Phoenix. For the Raptors, vs. Indiana Wednesday, @ Washington Friday, @ Miami Sunday.
