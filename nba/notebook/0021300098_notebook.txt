 THE FACT:  The Atlanta Hawks rode a dominating third quarter -- both offensively and defensively -- to its first back-to-back wins this season, and its first since taking two straight over the Indiana Pacers in the first round of last season's playoffs. 
 
 THE LEAD: Al Horford  scored 24 points as the Hawks made a third-quarter run stand up in a 103-94 victory over the Charlotte Bobcats on Monday night at Time Warner Cable Arena. 
 
 Cartier Martin  finished with 16 points,  Jeff Teague  had a double-double with 14 points and 12 assists, and  Kyle Korver  added 11 for the Hawks (4-3), who overcame an eight-point halftime deficit to lead by as many as 15 points in the fourth quarter. 
 
 Josh McRoberts  made five 3-pointers and finished with a season-high 19 points for the Bobcats (3-4), who lost their second straight despite having seven players finish in double figures. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It was a good win on the road for us. I think it was another step forward for our defense. ... In the third quarter, keeping them off the free throw line was a point of emphasis. We kept them to two free throws and 16 points in that third quarter, and that is where we got our separation."  
 
 -- Hawks coach  Mike Budenholzer 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Hawks shot 72.2 percent in the third quarter, making 13 of 18 from the field and 5 of 7 on 3-pointers, after shooting 43.6 percent (17-for-39, 4-for-15 on 3-pointers) in the first half. Meanwhile, Atlanta's defense held the Bobcats to 33.3 percent shooting (6-for-18, including 1-for-3 on 3-pointers) and forced six turnovers, good for 12 Hawks points during a 34-16 run in the period. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Horford scored 13 points and Teague had nine assists during the Hawks' key third-quarter run, which saw them go from down 54-46 to the Bobcats at the half to leading 80-70 entering the final period. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I thought that Horford had a terrific game, but Jeff Teague controlled that game from about the last four minutes of the second quarter all the way through the second half. We couldn't keep him out of the paint, we couldn't control the pick and roll, and the majority of their shots came directly from him."

 HOT ... THEN NOT:  Bobcats forward  Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  scored 16 points -- the fourth straight game he's been in double figures -- in the first half on 6-for-10 shooting and 4-for-5 on free throws. But he disappeared in the second half, attempting just one field goal and grabbing only two rebounds. 
 
 NOT ... THEN HOT:  Teague scored just five points and had three assists in the first half, going 2-for-8 from the field and 1-for- 2 on free throws. While his percentages didn't improve much in the second half -- Teague finished 4-for-14 from the field and 5-for-8 at the line -- his run of assists in the third quarter led to 21 Hawks points, 10 of those by Horford. 
 
 NOT ... THEN HOT II:  Bobcats center  Al Jefferson , making his first start after missing five games with a sprained ankle, showed how rusty he was in the first half against the Hawks, going 0-for-2 from the field and grabbing only one rebound in 10 minutes. But Jefferson played nearly 18 minutes in the second half, going 5-for-9 to finish with 10 points. He also pulled down a team-best seven rebounds. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Bobcats forward  Cody Zeller  struggled with his shooting for the second straight game. He was just 1-for-5 from the field against the Hawks after going 1-for-3 versus the Knicks three days earlier. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Korver reached a career milestone, making his 2,500th career field goal -- a 16-footer with 8:57 remaining in the second quarter. Korver went on to finish 4-for-9 against the Bobcats, giving him 2,502 made field goals over his 10-year NBA career. 
 However, Korver fell short of making another milestone -- his 2-for-6 effort on 3-pointers gave him 208 for his career, two made 3s behind  Craig Ehlo  for 10th on the Hawks' all-time list. But Korver did extend his streak of consecutive games with at least one made 3-pointer to 80, just nine games away from tying the NBA record held by  Dana Barros . 
 
 NOTABLE II:  The seven players in double figures for the Bobcats was a season-high, and equaled the club record set March 18, 2013, against the Washington Wizards. Twice this season -- in a season-opening loss to the Houston Rockets on Oct. 30, and a win over the New York Knicks on Nov. 5 -- Charlotte had five players finish in double figures. Against the Hawks, in addition to McRoberts, Kidd-Gilchrist and Jefferson,  Kemba Walker  had 12 points,  Gerald Henderson  11 and  Jeffery Taylor  and  Ramon Sessions  added 10 each.   
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Hawks, Wednesday vs. New York, Friday vs. Philadelphia, Saturday @ New York. For the Bobcats, Wednesday @ Boston, Friday @ Cleveland, Saturday vs. Miami.
