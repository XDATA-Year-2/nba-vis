 THE FACTS : The Sacramento Kings notched win number 14 on the season, besting the Cleveland Cavaliers by a final of 124-118 on Monday night just two days after being embarrassed by the Heat. 
 
 DeMarcus Cousins  led the way for Kings (14-24), finishing with 26 points, 14 rebounds and six assists.  Marcus Thornton  added 20 points. In his first game back in the starting lineup,  Tyreke Evans  scored 18 points on a perfect 6-for-6 shooting, but played only 25 minutes.  Rookie  Thomas Robinson  had a nice impact on the game off the Kings bench, scoring 12 points and grabbing seven rebounds in the win. 
 
 Dion Waiters  gave the Cavs (9-31) a nice bench punch, scoring a career-high 33 points on 12-for-18 shooting.   Tristan Thompson  added a solid 17-point, 15-rebound double-double in the loss. 
 
 THE STAT : The Kings bench, led by Thornton and  Jimmer Fredette  scored 54 points on 60-percent shooting (21-for-35) in the win.   
 
 QUOTABLE : "As a competitor, you want to be out there and play to help the team.  But, like I said, ultimately it's [the] coach's decision and they did a great job when they got back in the game of closing it out.  So, I did my job at that point and was able to cheer the team on and get a big win."  
 -- Jimmer Fredette on playing just 14 minutes despite scoring 16 points in the win 
 
 TURNING POINT : Freddette buried a big 3-pointer at the 4:06 mark of the fourth quarter, giving the Kings a 112-103 lead.  The Kings never trailed the rest of the way. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "When I'm in the game, I'm ready to play.  Coach saw something he liked and he went with it.  When it's my time, I'm ready to play."  
 -- Tyreke Evans on his limited minutes 
 
 HOT : Freddette came to play in the fourth quarter, scoring eight of his 16 points during a five minutes stretch in the final frame. 
 
 NOT: Kyrie Irving  struggled all night.  Last season's Rookie of the Year finished with 15 points, but shot just 6-for-19 from the floor and turned the ball over six times. 
 
 GOOD MOVE : Kings coach  Keith Smart  let Robinson play tonight and the rookie responded.  While his numbers weren't gaudy, he brought incredible energy to the game and kept plenty of plays alive for his teammates.   
 
 BAD MOVE : Waiters was really good tonight, but played just a total of 29 minutes off Cavs coach  Byron Scott 's bench.  
 
 NOTABLE : Waiters set a new career-high with 30 points.  Cousins went a perfect 12-for-12 from the free-throw line in the victory. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Cavs, Wednesday @ Portland, Saturday @ Utah, Tuesday vs. Boston. For the Kings, Wednesday vs. Washington, Friday @ Memphis, Saturday @ Charlotte.
