 THE FACT:  The Phoenix Suns are 20-1 vs. the Milwaukee Bucks in their current building. 
 
 THE LEAD:  The Suns are learning to play without  Eric Bledsoe .  
 
 Gerald Green , subbing for Bledsoe, had a season-high 24 points in leading the Suns (20-12) to an easy 116-110 win over the visiting Milwaukee Bucks (7-26) Saturday night.  
 Green came up with five steals, all of which led to Suns' fast-break scores, with Green himself slamming home four of them (one of the spectacular windmill variety). He took advantage of the Bucks' long, lazy cross-court passes, part of Milwaukee's staggering 26 turnovers. 
 
 Channing Frye  added 22 points, seven boards and two blocks. 
 Bledsoe missed his second straight game with a sprained knee, and the Suns are hoping he doesn't miss their entire upcoming five-game road trip. Bledsoe previously missed six games with a bruised shin. The Suns are 4-4 without Bledsoe. 
 For the Bucks,  Brandon Knight  had a game-high 25 points plus eight assists.  O.J. Mayo  scored 20.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "He's a little bit of a  Steve Nash  and a little bit of a  Manu Ginobili.  He probes like Nash, and he gets to the basket like Ginobili. ... His relentless attack in transition, getting to the basket, just knowing how to draw fouls. He has really blossomed into a great point guard."  
 -- Bucks coach  Larry Drew  on the Suns'  Goran Dragic 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Suns came up with 13 steals, while the Bucks had three. The Suns scored 38 off turnovers vs. seven for the Bucks. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Suns went on a 12-0 run early in the second quarter to open up a 40-28 lead. The Bucks never got closer than seven (87-80 and 91-84 early in the fourth quarter). 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I said, 'Coach, I took a couple crazy ones (shots).' He said, 'I never said anything.' ... I never had anyone like  (Jeff) Hornacek . He's given me that confidence."  
 -- Gerald Green, who says he prefers to call his playing style "free-spirited" as opposed to "wild" 
 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "We have to bring everything: scarves, gloves, hats ..."  
 -- Goran Dragic on the Suns' upcoming road trip to such cold locales as Chicago and Minneapolis 
 
 
 HOT:  Frye was 6-for-9 on 3-pointers. 
 
 NOT:  The Bucks'  Luke Ridnour  shot 1-for-4 and had three turnovers and one assist. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  The game matched the NBA's two youngest players and only two teenagers: the Suns'  Archie Goodwin  (19 years, 140 days) and the Bucks'  Giannis Antetokounmpo  (19 years, 29 days). Goodwin had seven points in 15 minutes while Antetokounmpo had zero points, four turnovers and three rebounds in 14 minutes. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Knight now has seven games with 20-plus points, including the past two games and three of the past five. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Bucks' 26 turnovers are the most for a Suns oppponent since a double-overtime game vs. Memphis on Nov. 5, 2010 and the most in regulation since a game vs. Sacramento on Feb. 2, 2009. ... Green's five steals were a career high. ... The Suns'  Ish Smith  tied season highs with eight points and eight assists. His role will be broadened with the loss of Bledsoe. ... The Suns won by 16 despite the Bucks shooting 54.4 percent. The last time they won by that much while giving up such a high percentage came on Jan. 17, 1995 when the Suns beat Denver 129-113 despite the Nuggets shooting 59 percent.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Bucks, Tuesday vs. Golden State, Friday vs. Chicago, Sunday @ Oklahoma City. For the Suns, Tuesday @ Chicago, Wednesday @ Minnesota, Friday @ Memphis.
