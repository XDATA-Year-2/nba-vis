  Notebook: Lakers 106, Timberwolves 101   By Jim Beilby, for NBA.com Posted Sunday January 29, 2012 11:05PM THE FACTS:  The Minnesota Timberwolves did everything they needed to do the win the game. Except make their shots. And the Los Angeles Lakers did make their shots as they defeated the Wolves 106-101 on Sunday night. Despite outrebounding the Lakers, having fewer turnovers, more second chance points, and more fast break points, Minnesota killed themselves by shooting 38.5 percent from the field.  Kobe Bryant  led the Lakers scoring 35 points and grabbing 14 rebounds.  Pau Gasol  and  Andrew Bynum  also stepped up big for Los Angeles, scoring 28 and 21 points respectively.  Kevin Love  led the Wolves, scoring 33 and grabbing 13 rebounds. This was only the second road victory of the season for the Lakers, compared to seven losses. QUOTABLE:  "They kicked our behinds on the glass. They got 24 offensive rebounds and 32 second chance points. It would be interesting to go back and watch the tape and see how they keep beating us to the ball. Maybe we were tired, maybe we didn't box out, I don't know. But you have the give them credit for getting 24 offensive rebounds."  --  Lakers' coach  Mike Brown. THE STAT:  Both teams made 40 field goals. But Minnesota needed 104 attempts to make their 40 while Los Angles only needed 79. Minnesota beat the Lakers 16-0 on fast break points, 32-10 on second chance points, and they grabbed 24 offensive rebounds (17 more than Los Angeles). TURNING POINT:  Despite leading by as many as 18, Los Angles was crushed by a 19-6 Minnesota run to close the third quarter and found themselves trailing by a point (94-93) with 3:19 to play in the game. The Lakers responded with a pair of dunks by Bynum, a jumper and a pair of freethrows by Gasol and pair of acrobatic field goals by Bryant to take a nine point lead with 20 seconds to play. The Lakers made the final 20 seconds more exciting than they should have been (Minnesota scored nine points in less than seven seconds), but the deficit was ultimately too much for Minnesota to overcome. HOT:  Gasol was 11-for-15 from the field, hitting jumpers from the top of the key all night long. NOT:  The shooting by Minnesota's guards was abysmal.  Ricky Rubio  was 2-for-13,  Luke Ridnour  was 2-for-8,  Wayne Ellington  was 0-for-4, and  Martell Webster  was 4-for-15, for a combined total of 8-for-40 (20 percent). NOTABLE:  Love has struggled against the Lakers, averaging only 12.2 points per game, his lowest average against a Western Conference opponent ... Minnesota failed in its second attempt to achieve a .500 record (they have not had a .500 record this late in the season since they were was 22-22 on Jan. 30, 2007) ... The Lakers did extend their winning streak against Minnesota to 16; the last time Minnesota beat the Lakers was March 6, 2007, when Love was still in high school. UP NEXT:  For the Wolves, Monday @ Houston, Wednesday vs. Indiana, Friday @ New Jersey. For the Lakers, Tuesday vs. Charlotte, Friday @ Denver, Saturday @ Utah.
