 THE FACT:  The Thunder pulled off their biggest rally in the Oklahoma City era, coming back from 12 points down in the fourth quarter and 10 points down in the final four minutes to beat the Wizards in overtime. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Oklahoma City's  Kevin Durant  and bcombined to score 58 points and grab 25 rebounds in leading the Thunder to a thrilling come-from-behind 106-105 overtime win against the Washington Wizards. 
 Durant had a double-double with 33 points and 13 boards and hit a game-tying 3-pointer with 13.6 left in regulation. Ibaka finished one point shy of tying his career high with 25 points and 12 rebounds.  Russell Westbrook  scored 13 on 4-for-16 shooting before being ejected after his second technical foul and  Reggie Jackson  added 12. 
 Beal led all scorers with a career-high 34 points on 13-for-23 shooting including 6-for-8 on 3-pointers. He missed a potential gime-winning shot with just under two seconds left in regulation. The Wizards' other starters also scored in double digits.  Trevor Ariza  had 15,  Nene  had 14 on 5-for-6 shooting before he also got tossed after a second technical foul.  Marcin Gortat  added 11 and  John Wall  finished with 10 but was just 3-for-13 shooting and he missed a running layup at the end of overtime that would have won the game at the buzzer. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "That never-quit mentality we've always had, that's what got the win for us tonight. We just played inspired basketball when we were down 10." 
 
 -- Thunder head coach  Scott Brooks 
 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Westbrook and Nene had been jawing with each other at various times during the game. They picked up double technicals halfway through the third quarter and again with 3:19 left in the game. Their second technicals resulted in both being ejected and that seemed to ignite the Thunder. OKC went on a 14-4 run after the ejections to close out regulation and forge the tie.  
 
 THE STAT:  After the ejections, OKC finished regulation going 6-for-7 and held the Wizards to 2-for-6 and a turnover. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I give Oklahoma City credit for coming back. They made shots. All we needed to do at the end of regulation was make one shot or a couple of free throws and the game would have been over. We played our tails off but came up short." 
 
 -- Wizards head coach  Randy Wittman 
 
 
 HOT:  Oklahoma City was 6-for-8 (14 points) on fast-break opportunities in the first half and finished with 20 on 7-for-12 shooting. ... Beal was 5-for-6 on 3-pointers in the second half. 
 
 NOT:  Westbrook started ice cold, going just 1-for-5 (three points) in the first quarter. ... OKC was just 3-for-18 (16.7 percent) in the second quarter and 1-for-8 (12.5 percent) from beyond the arc in the first half. ... The Wizards were just 6-for-15 (40 percent) from the free-throw line in the first half. ... Wizards center  Marcin Gortat  was 0-for-5 (one point) in the first 24 minutes. ... The Wizards scored just four fast-break points on 1-for-5 shooting. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  Athletic trainer  Rob McClanaghan , who works with Durant, Westbrook and Wall in the offseason and at other times was in the building. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  In the second quarter Ibaka blocked a shot then beat everyone back down the floor to take a pass from Durant for a slam. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  After a Wizards basket late in the second quarter, Westbrook stood by himself waiting to inbound the ball while all of his teammates went to the other end of the floor. Durant tried to scramble back to take the inbounds pass but the delay forced Brooks to take a timeout. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Thunder rookie center  Steven Adams  was 0-for-3, scoring one point, blocking two shots and grabbing two rebounds. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Durant's game-tying 3-pointer was his 12th career game-tying shot in the last 24 seconds of a game. That's the most in the NBA since the start of the 2007-08 season. ... Thunder backup forward  Nick Collison  did not play. He has a bruised left hip and is being listed as day-to-day. ... The Wizards are now 0-5 against the Thunder in Oklahoma City. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Wizards: Tuesday @ Dallas, Wednesday @ San Antonio, Saturday vs. Cleveland. For the Thunder: Wednesday @ L.A. Clippers, Thursday @ Golden State, Saturday @ Milwaukee.
