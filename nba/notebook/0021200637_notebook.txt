 THE FACTS:  The Memphis Grizzlies figured Brooklyn would be ready to defend the post-up moves of center  Marc Gasol  and  Zach Randolph . So instead, they turned to their pick-and-roll offense, something the Nets had a difficult time containing, particularly in the first half. Gasol had his way with 20 points, all coming in the first half, as the Grizzlies led by as many as 30 before cruising to a 101-77 win, their fourth in the last five games. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We're a whole different team when we move the ball. We did a pretty good job in the first half of moving the ball. ... We knew what was there. They wanted to show on the pick and roll and that created mismatches inside."  
 -- Marc Gasol 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Grizzlies have topped the 100-point mark in back-to-back games after doing so just once in their previous 27 games. Overall, they are 13-0 this season when scoring 100 points. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Trailing 42-33 with 7:24 left in the second quarter, Brooklyn went scoreless for three minutes, during which time the Grizzlies went on an 11-0 run to build a 20-point cushion. From there, the Nets never got closer than 18. 
 
 HOT:  Gasol came out blazing, scoring eight of the Grizzlies first 10 points. He made 10 of his 14 shot attempts in the first half while also hauling in seven of his nine boards by halftime. 
 
 NOT:  Before the game, Nets coach  P.J. Carlesimo  said he thought his backcourt of  Joe Johnson  and  Deron Williams  were worthy of being All-Stars. They didn't show it Friday. Both guards were 4-for-10 from the floor with Williams scoring 12 points and Johnson 11. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Since being blown out by Dallas, the L.A. Clippers and San Antonio, the Grizzlies have won four of their last five games, with their only loss being a one-point setback to Indiana on Monday. ... The Grizzlies scored 32 points in the first quarter and 35 in the second, thanks to 60 percent shooting. In the second half, the offense got stagnant after opening a 30-point lead. They managed to score just 18 in the third quarter and 16 in the fourth, however, still shooting 52 percent for the game. Fortunately, their defense remained stingy as the Nets scored just 10 points in the final quarter and shot just 40.8 percent for the game. ... In the two games since trading away  Marreese Speights ,  Wayne Ellington  and  Josh Selby , the Grizzlies bench has become more potent. After scoring 43 points against the L.A. Lakers Wednesday, the Grizzlies bench totaled 38 points against Brooklyn.  Jerryd Bayless  and rookie  Tony Wroten  each scored 11, while  Chris Johnson , who is currently on a 10-day contract from the NBA D-League, had 10. Bayless also had eight assists. ... Forward  Reggie Evans  made his presence felt in the second half when he scored eight of his 11 points, giving him a double-double with 10 rebounds. ... Newly crowned All-Star Zach Randolph, the NBA leader in double-double, fell one rebound shy of adding to his total with 12 points and nine boards. Randolph, who made his first All-Star appearance in 2011, became the first Memphis player to become a two-time All-Star. ... The Grizzlies outscored the Nets 62-40 in the paint, and held a 27-10 advantage in second-chance points. ... The loss was just the third in 15 games since Carlesimo took over the Nets' coaching duties when  Avery Johnson  was fired. ... Grizzlies forward  Rudy Gay  played in his 477th game for Memphis, surpassing  Pau Gasol  as the franchise leader in games played. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Nets, Saturday at Houston, Monday vs. Orlando, Wednesday vs. Miami. For the Grizzlies, Sunday vs. New Orleans, Monday at Philadelphia, Thursday at Oklahoma City.
