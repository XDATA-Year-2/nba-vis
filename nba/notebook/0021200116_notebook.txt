 THE FACTS:   Carlos Boozer  scored a game-high 28 points and added 14 rebounds, and  Rip Hamilton  scored four points in overtime as the Chicago Bulls recovered after squandering an 18-point lead to beat the Phoenix Suns 112-106 on Wednesday night. 
 
 Luol Deng  and  Joakim Noah  each scored 21 and Hamilton finished with 15 for the Bulls, who were opening their five-game, 12-day annual "circus" road trip.  Kirk Hinrich , who missed the Bulls' last game with a strained right hip, returned and had three points and seven assists in 27 minutes. 
 
 Luis Scola  scored 24 points and  Sebastian Telfair  added 17 for the Suns, who rallied from a four-point deficit in the final 64 seconds of regulation to take the game to overtime. 
 Hamilton had a chance to win the game in regulation, but his shot was blocked by  Shannon Brown  with 1.6 seconds remaining. 
 The Bulls scored on each of their first five overtime possessions, the last on an 18-footer by Noah, to open a 110-101 lead with 1:23 to go. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "We had a big lead and when you have a big lead sometimes you slip up."  
 -- Hamilton  
 
 THE STAT : In their past four games, the Suns have trailed by by 26, 22, 10 and 18 points. Phoenix has trailed by double digits in eight of nine contests this season.   
 
 TURNING POINT:  Trailing by two, Telfair had the ball tipped away from him as he drove the lane. But the ball went directly to  P.J. Tucker , who went up unopposed for a short jumper to tie the score at 100-100 with 9.4 seconds left in regulation.  
 
 QUOTABLE II : "Tonight wasn't out night, but it's all about the fight."  
 -- P.J.Tucker  
 
 HOT:  Boozer hit 8 of his first 12 shots and finished 11-for-20. His 24 points were two fewer than he's scored in his last three games combined. 
 
 NOT:  Beasley was 2-for-13 from the floor in regulation, with three turnovers and four rebounds. He recovered to score the Suns' first six points in overtime, but badly missed a 3-pointer in the final minute. Beasley has shot better than 33.3 percent only once this season. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Suns were playing their first overtime game since April 11, 2011. ... The Bulls were 4-for-11 from the field in the fourth, 5-for-11 in overtime. ... Chicago did not trail after tying the score at 46-46 on a  Jimmy Butler  layup with 4:25 left in the first half. ... Three Bulls players -- Hamilton, Hinrich and  Nate Robinson --  all were called for technical fouls. ... Phoenix has dropped four straight to Chicago at home and seven of its past eight against the Bulls overall. ... The Suns lost for the first time this season when scoring 100 points (3-1). 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Bulls, Saturday @ LA Clippers, Sunday at Portland, Wednesday at Houston. For the Suns, Friday @ LA Lakers, Saturday vs. Miami, Wednesday vs. Portland.
