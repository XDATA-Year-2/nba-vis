 THE FACTS:   The Oklahoma City Thunder had been playing ping pong basketball lately -- win one, lose one, win one, lose one, win one.  Kevin Durant  wanted to change that pattern Wednesday and he and his teammates did, leading the Thunder to a 119-98 win over Golden State. It's the first time OKC has won back-to-back games since mid-January. 
 Durant led a trio of Thunder scorers past the 20-point mark. He finished with a game-high 25 points on 10-for-18 shooting. Durant also grabbed seven rebounds, and had four assists, two steals and two blocks.  Russell Westbrook  added 22 and  Kevin Martin  dropped in 21 on an 8-for-16 night from the floor and 3-for-6 from long range. Martin is now 10-for-16 on 3-balls against the Warriors this season. 
 
 Klay Thompson  and  Harrison Barnes  led Golden State with 19 points. Barnes was 7-for-9 on the night.  Stephen Curry  added 14 but was just 5-for-20 shooting. He also dished out 11 assists.  David Lee  struggled shooting the ball also (5-for-13) and scored 12 points while pulling down 11 rebounds. 
 The Thunder had two other players in double figures.  Serge Ibaka  had a dominating night with 15 points, nine rebounds, six blocks and four assists.  Reggie Jackson  came off the bench to score 12 points and hand out six assists. 
 The Thunder led by as many as 26 points, blocked 16 shots and scored a whopping 29 points off of 19 Golden State turnovers. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We did a good job of getting our hands on loose balls on defense, forcing a lot of turnovers and we were looking for the open man on offense. It was a good win for us." 
 
 -- Westbrook 
 
 
 THE STAT:  After scoring 32 and 42 points in the paint against the Warriors in the first two games this season the Thunder dominated inside scoring 64 points in the painted area tonight and allowing Golden State to score just 40 down low. The Thunder bench scored 44 points against the Warriors tonight after managing just 27 in the loss last month in Oakland. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Golden State used a 30 point third quarter to cut a 22 point OKC lead in half by the time the horn sounded. The Thunder started the fourth quarter with a 16-4 run to push the margin to a much more comfortable 23. Both coaches began emptying their benches at that point. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We were not sharp defensively. I thought we played well in spurts, but you give up 64 points in the paint and 29 points off turnovers, that's a recipe for disaster coming into this building against this team. We talked about it before hand and we just didn't get it done." 
 
 -- Warriors head coach  Mark Jackson 
 
 
 HOT:  The Thunder started the game shooting 61.9 percent (13-for-21) ... OKC finished the first half at 56.5 percent ... Ibaka was 6-for-7 (13 points) in the first 24 minutes ... Martin was 4-for-5 (10 points) in the fourth quarter ... Thompson was 4-for-4 (eight points) in the fourth. 
 
 NOT:  Golden State struggled from the floor in the first quarter going just 9-for-26 (34.6 percent) ... The Warriors finished the first half only marginally better (37.0 percent) ... The Thunder got into transition 12 times in the first half but managed to convert only five of 12 shots ... Curry was 4-for-13 in the first half ... The Thunder shot 37.9 percent in the third quarter. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The 91st consecutive sellout crowd inside Chesapeake Energy Arena. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  In the first quarter Westbrook drove into the lane on  Andris Biedrins  and cocked back for a tomahawk dunk but while he was in mid-air Westbrook was afraid Biedrins was in position to block his dunk so he changed the shot to a finger roll instead that went up and over Biedrins and into the basket. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Thunder have had problems off and on this season playing a little too relaxed with a big lead and it happened again in the third quarter tonight. OKC led by as many as 22 in the first half and by 18 at halftime but allowed the Warriors back in when Golden State put up 30 in the third quarter. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "We gave up a little of our lead in the third quarter when we forgot to play defense there for a few minutes." 
 
 -- Thunder head coach  Scott Brooks 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Warriors head coach Mark Jackson told reporters before the game, "we're a no excuses basketball team," but after being blown out in Houston the night before, the Warriors team charter couldn't land in Oklahoma City because of dense fog. The flight was diverted 90 miles away to Tulsa and the team bussed in from there. Players didn't arrive at their hotel until almost 5 a.m. Early in the game it looked like the Warriors were trying to catch up on lost sleep. They were shooting 37 percent and had 11 turnovers at halftime. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Warriors, Friday @ Memphis, Saturday @ Dallas, Tuesday vs. Houston. For the Thunder, Friday vs. Phoenix, Sunday @ Phoenix, Tuesday @ Utah.
