 THE FACT:   At 2-3, the Bulls have the same record after five games as the 1990-91 Bulls team had on its way to the Bulls' first-ever NBA title. 
 
 THE LEAD:   Luol Deng  had a near triple-double to lead the Bulls out of their early season funk for a 97-73 victory over the winless Utah Jazz Friday at the United Center. Deng had a game-high 19 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists, as well as five steals and five turnovers. He was 7-for-9 from the field.  Gordon Hayward  had 15 points to lead the Jazz.  
 
 THE FACT II:  The Jazz shot 29 percent from the field, making just 25 of 85 shots. Hayward, who shot 55.6 percent from the floor in his two previous game, was 5-for-15 while  Alec Burks  was 3-for-13.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We can be better than we were tonight." 
 -- Utah coach  Tyrone Corbin 
 
 
 THE STAT : The Bulls entered the game ranked 27th in the league in field goal percentage, shooting just 41.2 percent, but against the Jazz they made 38 of 72 shots for 53 percent from the field. The starting front line of the Bulls -- Deng,  Carlos Boozer  and  Joakim Noah  -- was 20-of-29 from the field.   
 
 THE STAT II:  Despite playing a game that was no challenge on the scoreboard, the Bulls committed 20 turnovers. They ranked 22nd in the league going into the game, averaging 18.5 turnovers per game.    
 
 THE STAT III:  The Jazz bench almost outrebounded the Jazz starters, 22-18. On the defensive glass, the bench had 11 boards and the starters had 12.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  After leading by as much as 16 points early in the second quarter, the Bulls tried to let the Jazz back into the game, and the lead dwindled to eight points, 44-36. The Bulls led by 11 at halftime then scored 11 of the first 15 points in the third quarter to build an 18-point lead. 
 
 HOT:  Boozer started the game 10th in the league in field goal percentage shooting 58.8 percent and hit 7 of 11 shots against the Jazz Friday.  
 
 NOT:  The Jazz bench got a lot of playing time Friday and used it to shoot 9-for-34 (26.5 percent) from the field.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Some of them are just us being unselfish. That's the kind of team we are. Some of them... we just have to play through it." 
 -- Bulls guard  Derrick Rose , talking about the team's turnover troubles. 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Although it came later than fans wanted (with about 3:37 remaining in the game and the Bulls leading by 24 points), Bulls coach  Tom Thibodeau  finally went to his deep bench and brought in rookies  Tony Snell  and  Erik Murphy  and second-year guard  Marquis Teague . It was Snell's third appearance of the season (he has 11 total minutes of play), Murphy's second (four minutes) and Teague's second (three minutes). 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Between the 2:59 mark of the second quarter and the 1:13 mark, there were no points scored by either team, but the Bulls had one technical foul for defensive positioning, two turnovers, a delay of game, and only one shot taken. The Jazz had six consecutive missed shots.   
 
 NOTABLE:  The Bulls shot 50 percent from the field for the first time this season... In the 2012-13 season, the Bulls shot 50 percent or better just 11 times. Deng, who finished one assist shy of a triple-double, has never had a triple-double in his 10-year career... the Jazz, which entered the game as the No. 1 team in the league in offensive rebounds averaging 15.4 per game, had 17 offensive boards Friday.   
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Bulls, vs. Cleveland Monday, @ Toronto Friday, vs. Indiana Nov. 16. For the Jazz, @ Toronto Saturday, vs. Denver Monday, vs. New Orleans Wednesday.
