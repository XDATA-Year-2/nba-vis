 THE FACT:   Minnesota outscored Indiana 22-8 from the free-throw line in taking a 66-65 lead with 3:09 left in the third quarter. The Timberwolves made just one more free throw as the Pacers finished the game on a 33-18 run. 
 
 THE LEAD:    George Hill  normally is the fifth Beatle of the Indiana Pacers but on this night, he was every bit the front man. The under-appreciated point guard scored 26 points with seven assists and five steals -- not to mention a well-timed technical foul -- to spark the Pacers to a 98-84 victory over the visiting Minnesota Timberwolves before 16,426 Monday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse.  Paul George  scored 26 points with eight rebounds and four assists for Indiana (13-1).  Kevin Love  had 20 points and 17 rebounds for Minnesota (8-8), which lost for the fourth time in five games.  Nikola Pekovic  had 18 points and 11 rebounds. 
 
 QUOTABLE:   "A great lift from a guy everybody forgets to mention when they talk about our team, George Hill, but he's a beast of a guard and he's capable of exploding like he did tonight."  
 -- Indiana coach  Frank Voge l 
 
 
 THE STAT:   Indiana established a franchise record by starting 8-0 at home. The previous best was a 7-0 start in 2002-03.  
 
 TURNING POINT:   The Pacers were showing their frustration at the free throw disparity in the third quarter as both  David West  and Hill picked up technical fouls protesting whistles while Minnesota was putting together a 14-7 run -- with eight of the points coming from the line -- to take a 66-65 lead. But the Pacers regrouped, picked up their defense and George took over, scoring 11 points in a 22-4 run that put the home team ahead 87-70 with 6:34 remaining. The Timberwolves did not go to the line during that run and in fact went nearly 12 minutes between trips. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We knew the way the game was going, if we continued to let our emotions get to us we probably would've walked away with a loss tonight." 
 -- George 
 
 
 HOT:  Hill shot 9-for-13, including 3-for-4 from the 3-point line, while George was 10-for-16 and made all four of his 3-point attempts as the Pacers shot 50 percent overall. 
 
 NOT:  The Timberwolves shot just 32.6 percent overall, 15.8 percent (3-for-19) from the 3-point line, both season lows for an Indiana opponent. Love was 6-for-20,  Kevin Martin  4-for-14 and  Corey Brewer  3-for-12, missing all five of his 3-point attempts.  
 
 QUOTABLE III:   "We knew coming in that they were a second-half team but we turned the ball over and gave them a lot of easy looks. We shot the ball poorly, plain and simple."  
 - Love 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Timberwolves reportedly agreed to a trade during the game that will send former No. 2 pick  Derrick Williams  to Sacramento for  Luc Mbah a Moute , a former UCLA teammate of  Kevin Love . The deal is expected to bolster Minnesota's defense and depth, but at the cost of a talent drafted behind only  Kyrie Irving  in 2011 with the highest selection in Timberwolves history. ... Indiana is 5-0 when two players score at least 20 points. ...  Luis Scola  had a season high with eight rebounds. ... The Pacers had a season-high 52 points in the paint. ... Minnesota has lost five in a row in Indianapolis. ...  David West  had 13 points and  Lance Stephenson  11 for the Pacers. ... Stephenson made a 3-pointer in the fourth quarter to snap a streak of 10 consecutive misses. ... Martin scored 18 for the Timberwolves, while  Ricky Rubio  had seven points, nine rebounds, seven assists and five steals. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Pacers, Wednesday at Charlotte, Friday vs. Washington, Sunday at L.A. Clippers. For the Timberwolves, Wednesday vs. Denver, Saturday at Dallas, Sunday at Oklahoma City.
