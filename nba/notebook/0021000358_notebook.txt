  Bucks-Mavericks Notebook   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Tuesday December 14, 2010 12:05AM THE FACTS:  Double-doubles from  Brandon Jennings  and  Andrew Bogut  and some streaky 3-point shooting helped Milwaukee snap several other streaks with a 103-99 victory Monday in Dallas, including a 12-game winning streak by the Mavericks. The Bucks, who won for the fourth time in five games, also halted a five-game road skid and ended a seven-game slide in Dallas.  Dirk Nowitzki  led all scorers with 30 points, but missed a potential tying jumper in the lane with 11.8 seconds left. QUOTABLE:  "When we didn't play well early, it would've been easy to hang our heads and figure, 'Hey, they're a great club.' But we battled back and we came out in the third quarter with some really nice juice."    -- Bucks coach  Scott Skiles , whose team overcame a 20-point, second-quarter deficit THE STAT:  The Bucks shot a season-high 69.2 percent (9-for-13) from 3-point distance. Jennings and  Keyon Dooling  were both 3-for-4, Ersan Ilyasova was 2-for-3 and John Salmons was 1-for-2. TURNING POINT:  The Mavericks led by 20 in the first half (42-22) and never trailed until midway through the third. Down 88-85 with 6:12 remaining in the fourth, the Bucks put together a 14-0 run to seize a 97-88 edge with 3:23 left. Salmons and Ilyasova both buried 3-pointers during that surge and Bogut contributed two dunks. HOT:  Bogut registered his fifth consecutive double-double (21 points, 14 rebounds) since returning from a five-game absence due to back spasms. He was 10-for-12 from the field, but just 1-for-6 at the line before fouling out with 1:06 remaining. Bogut blocked two shots and needs one more for career rejection No. 500. NOT:  After shooting the lights out (14-for-26) from behind the arc in Saturday's win against Utah, the Mavericks shot just 25 percent against the Bucks. Nowitzki went 3-for-6, but the rest of the team was a combined 2-for-14. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Jennings scored 18 of his 23 points in the second half (10 in the third) and collected his fourth double-double with 10 assists. He added five rebounds and two steals. ... With some clutch drives to the basket,  Chris-Douglas Roberts  added 14 points (4-for-5 FG), five rebounds and four assists off the bench. ... Jason Kidd finished with 11 points, 10 assists, seven rebounds and three steals for the Mavs. ROOKIE WATCH:  Forward  Larry Sanders  started for Milwaukee, but didn't play at all in the second half and was 0-for-2 from the field (1-for-15 in his last three games). ... Mavericks guard  Dominique Jones  is nursing a back injury suffered over the weekend in D-League play. "He's getting treatment and we're hopeful that he'll be back playing very soon," Dallas head coach Rick Carlisle said. NOTABLE:  The Bucks improved to 6-1 this season when shooting greater than 45 percent (47.6). They overcame a poor first quarter (7-for-21) by shooting 61.1 percent in the third quarter (11-for-18). ... It was the Mavericks' first loss since Nov. 19, an 83-88 decision at home against Chicago. ... Milwaukee outscored Dallas 52-38 in the paint.
