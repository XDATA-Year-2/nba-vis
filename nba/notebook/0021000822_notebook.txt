  Jazz-Suns notebook   By Mike Tulumello, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday February 16, 2011 12:48AM THE FACTS:  The Phoenix Suns' 3-point game is alive and well. And because of this, so are their playoff chances. The Suns nailed a dozen 3-pointers, with  Channing Frye  hitting six of them, as the Suns came from behind in the final quarter to squeak past the Utah Jazz 102-101 Tuesday night in Arizona. "I was trying to figure out ways to get open," said Frye, who had a career-high 31 points, including 19 in a first quarter in which he hit all five of his three-point tries. "I had confidence, and my teammates put me in position to succeed. They were doing the little things to get me open ... dribble penetration and setting screens." The Suns, though, nearly threw the game away with 19 turnovers. The final one could have been the worst of their season. Leading 99-98,  Steve Nash  nearly dribbled out the shot clock, and the Suns failed to get off a shot in 24 seconds. That set up  Deron Williams  for a possible game-winner, but he missed a 20-footer. Frye grabbed the rebound but hit only 1-for-2 from the line. So the Jazz, trailing 100-98, had one last chance with 8.1 seconds left. But  Paul Millsap  lost the ball while driving the baseline. Nash hit both free throws to seal the win. The Jazz went on a 7-0 run to start the final quarter, giving them an 80-73 lead. They led 89-81 when the Suns battled back with their 3-point game.  Mickael Pietrus  nailed a pair of bombs and Frye added one as the Suns went on an 11-0 run to take a 92-89 lead. The Suns, winners of eight of their last 10 games, moved to 27-26. They are 2 1/2 games behind Denver and Utah (31-25) for the Nos. 7 and 8 playoff slots. The Jazz are 0-2 under new coach  Ty Corbin , with both losses coming to the Suns. In addition to Frye, the Suns got 20 points and 14 assists from  Steve Nash . Also, Pietrus, who has often struggled since being acquired in a big December trade, had his most significant game in Arizona: 11 points, four rebounds and four blocked shots. Al Jefferson  kept the Jazz in the game with 32 points and 10 boards. But Williams, hounded by the Suns'  Grant Hill , was limited to 11 points, 11 assists and six turnovers. QUOTABLE:  "I can't say enough about Grant. I don't think he gets the credit. If anyone should be on the all-defensive team, it should be him." -- Suns coach Alvin Gentry, lauding the 38-year-old Hill, who guards players at four positions and generally takes the opponent's best player. THE STAT:  The Suns shot 12-for-29 on 3-pointers (41 percent), including three straight makes in the final quarter. TURNING POINT:  The Suns, down 89-81 with 7:00 left, went on an 11-0 run to set up the win. QUOTABLE II:  "I kind of like guarding point guards. You can use your length to try to keep them out of the paint and make them take contested shots."    -- Hill HOT:  For the Suns, Frye hit 12-for-16, including 6-for-10 on 3-pointers. NOT:  For the Jazz, Williams shot 2-for-11. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Goran Dragic, the Suns' backup point guard, returned after missing seven games (the Suns went 5-2) after he said he stepped on glass at his home. He played five minutes and shot 1-for-3 for two points. Dragic has has a disappointing season after emerging as a playoff hero last year. He will be challenged for the backup point guard spot by Zabian Dowdell, who played at the start of the final quarter vs. the Jazz. NOTABLE:  With his ninth assist (midway through the third quarter), Nash passed  Gary Payton  (8,966) on the all-time assist list and is now No. 7. ... The Suns went 3-0 vs. the Jazz this season, their first series sweep against them since 1982-83. The Jazz were not helped by the fact that four players missed with injuries: Andrei Kirilenko, Mehmet Okur, Raja Bell and Ronnie Price. They were left with nine players. ... The Suns, the NBA's worst defensive team for a considerable part of this season (they bottomed out at 50 percent in field-goal percentage allowed), have turned it around in a big way. Coming into the Jazz' game, they'd allowed 43.5 percent in their previous 10 games. That's fourth-best in this span. For the season, they're now No. 22 at 46.9 percent. Against the Jazz, they allowed 46 percent shooting. UP NEXT:  For the Jazz, Wednesday vs Golden State, Feb. 23 @ Dallas, Feb. 25 @ Indiana. For the Suns, Thursday vs. Dallas, Feb. 23 vs. Atlanta, Feb. 25 @ Toronto.
