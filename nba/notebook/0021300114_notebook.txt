 THE FACT:  Memphis has allowed its opponents to score 100 or more points in four of its eight games this season. Last year, opponents reached the 100-point mark just 11 times against the Grizzlies. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Toronto forward  Rudy Gay  returned to FedExForum for the first time since being traded to the Raptors last February. He responded with an impressive line, scoring 23 points to go with six rebounds, five steals and two blocks to lead his team to a 103-87 win. Another former Grizzly, guard  Kyle Lowry , chipped with 21 points and six assists and  DeMar DeRozen  added 18, with 13 of those coming in the first quarter. The Grizzlies were led by  Mike Conley , who had 29 points and five assists.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "After [Monday] night's game, I just wanted to get my teammates involved first. I picked my spots when I wanted to be aggressive and my teammates worked with me. DeMar had it going in the first quarter and I didn't have to press a lot. It's easier when he has it going, for sure."  
 -- Rudy Gay 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Grizzlies have lost back-to-back games for the first time this season. They entered the game as the only team in the NBA without consecutive wins or consecutive losses this season. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  After falling behind by eight points midway through the third quarter, the Grizzlies rallied to tie the game at 70 with 3:34 left in the quarter. Toronto gathered itself and ended the quarter with a 8-1 run, then started the fourth period on a 14-3 run build a 92-74 cushion that pushed the score out of reach. 
 
 HOT:  The Raptors were aggressive in going to the basket and paid off. They were 33-for-39 from the free-throw line (.846). 
 
 NOT:  Conversely, the Grizzlies shot just 17 foul shots and made 11 (.647). 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I'm tired of playing from behind. I'm really tired of it. We start playing faster than we actually want to play."  
 -- Grizzlies coach  Dave Joerger 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  In a losing cause, Conley continues to be the Grizzlies leading scorer. Conley topped the 20-point mark for the fifth time in the team's eight games with a season-high 29, just two shy of his career high. Conley made 12 of his 19 shots and finally regained his touch from 3-point range with four 3s. He hadn't made more than one in a game this season. ... Center  Marc Gasol  had his first double-double of the season for the Grizzlies with 18 points and 10 rebounds. ... The win was Gay's first against his former team after losing last year to the Grizzlies in Toronto, 88-82. Gay, who played six seasons in Memphis, is the team's all-time leader in games played (479), and minutes played (17,338). ... Toronto made 8-for-15 3-pointers (.533). Gay was 4-for-6 from long range and Lowry was 3-for-5. ... The win against Memphis was just the second in the last 10 meetings for the Raptors.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Raptors, Friday vs. Chicago, Sunday vs. Portland, Wednesday at Philadelphia. For the Grizzlies, Friday at L.A. Lakers, Sunday at Sacramento, Monday at L.A. Clippers.
