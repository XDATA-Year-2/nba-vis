 THE FACTS:  It didn't matter that dynamic point guards  Tony Parker  and  Kyrie Irving  missed this game. There was plenty of offense as the San Antonio Spurs shot 58 percent from the field and  Tim Duncan  scored 30 points in San Antonio's 119-113 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday at AT&T Center. 
 The Spurs (51-16) missed Parker for a seventh straight game (they are 5-2 without him) with an ankle sprain and the Cavs did not have Irving for the third game (1-2 without him) because of a shoulder sprain. But Duncan had Parker-like numbers, hitting 13-for-19 and being joined in double figures in the starting group by  Kawhi Leonard 's 24 points off 8-for-16 shooting. 
 Cleveland (22-44) also hit more than half its shots (51 percent), led by seven points in the first half and had a one-point lead as late as five minutes to go.  Wayne Ellington , who missed Friday's game at Dallas with a sprained ankle, shot 8-for-13 (4-7 from the 3-point line) for 21 points. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "They've still got star power. Still, to me, they play better than anybody in the league. They may not be the most talented, but they play better than anybody in the league." 
 
 -- Cavs coach  Byron Scott  on the Spurs 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Spurs finished with 32 assists and now are 13-0 when they finish the game with at least 30 assists. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Cleveland led 103-102 when Ellington hit a layup with five minutes remaining. But the Spurs scored nine straight points with a pair of baskets from Duncan and two buckets from Leonard -- including a 3-pointer -- and San Antonio was up by eight with less than three minutes left. 
 
 HOT:  Ellington opened by hitting his first four shots. His game total was his best effort since going 7-for-9 (3-for-3 on 3-pointers) on Jan. 21 in a loss against Indiana. 
 
 NOT:  Cavaliers forward  Tristan Thompson , who played less than two hours away in Austin at University of Texas two seasons ago, shot 3-for-12 while Duncan was blocking five shots underneath. It was his first night shooting less than 50 percent from the floor in eight games, and Thompson also failed to collect double digits in either scoring or rebounding for the first time in 35 games. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Duncan, just off a 28-point, 19-rebound night against Dallas on Thursday, scored 30, had 12 rebounds, four assists and five blocked shots. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH: Dion Waiters  scored 15 and had a chance for his season-high fourth straight game of scoring at least 20 points. ...  Nando De Colo  was 4-for-6, including 3-for-4 on 3-pointers, for 11 points for the Spurs a night after playing for Austin in the NBA D-League. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Spurs coach  Gregg Popovich  was ejected after the Spurs blew a nine-point lead and trailed by four with 6 1/2 minutes left in the first half when  Boris Diaw  was called for an offensive foul. ... This was the second of a back-to-back for Cleveland as the Cavs lost by 10 on Friday at Dallas. ... San Antonio has defeated Cleveland eight straight times. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Cavaliers, Monday vs. Indiana, Wednesday vs. Indiana, Friday @ Houston. For the Spurs, Wednesday vs.. Golden State, Friday vs. Utah, March 24 @ Houston.
