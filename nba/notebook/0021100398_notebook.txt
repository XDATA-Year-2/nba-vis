  Notebook: Mavericks 104, Timberwolves 97 Posted Friday February 10, 2012 11:47PM By Jim Beilby, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  In game showcasing two of the leagues premier power forwards,  Kevin Love  matched  Dirk Nowitzki's  numbers, but Dirk and the Dallas Mavericks won the battle that mattered most, defeating the Minnesota Timberwolves 104-97 on Friday night. Nowitzki scored 33 points and gave Dallas a quick start, hitting a pair of 3-pointers to key a 20-4 run early in the first quarter. Love played his first game after serving a two game suspension and made a big difference, scoring 32 points and grabbing 12 rebounds. The Wolves were 1-1 in his absence, but cleared missed his 25.0 points and 13.7 rebounds per game. QUOTABLE:  "Dirk played great at both ends [of the floor]. He gave us a presence around the basket with his length and he was getting the ball in the basket. His threes were timely threes. . . And I don't know what [ Jason's Kidd's ] plus-minus was, but he had to be about a plus 15 or 18. He got us off the a great start and then when they cut it to three, we put him back in the game and he got us back up to 13 or 14."  --  Dallas head coach  Rick Carlisle . THE STAT:  Minnesota turned the ball over a season-high 28 times leading to 30 Dallas points and Dallas recorded a season high 16 steals. TURNING POINT:  After trailing by as many as 17 points with 4:00 to play in the third quarter, Minnesota went on a 16-3 run to cut Dallas's lead to three points. Dallas, however, immediately responded with 14-4 run and eventually built a 14-point lead with 5:35 to play. Minnesota never seriously threatened Dallas after that. QUOTABLE II:  "Very disappointed in our concentration tonight. We slipped backwards... our turnovers: disasterous. We never gave ourselves a chance. We would cut into the lead and then turn it over two or three times and let them open it back up again. We have got to get our concentration back to where it needs to be."  --  Minnesota head coach  Rick Adelman. HOT:  Minnesota's duo of Love and Beasley shot 17-for-27 from the floor (62.9%) NOT:  Minnesota's squadron of guards ( Luke Ridnour ,  Ricky Rubio , and  J.J. Barea ) shot 5-for-24 (20.8 percent). In fact, Minnesota's guards did not make a field goal until Rubio hit a jumpshot with 40 seconds to play in the second quarter. NOTABLE:  The Mavericks eclipsed the century mark tonight for the ninth time in their 27 games. They are 8-1 when doing so. With a victory, Minnesota would have completed a season sweep of Dallas. The only other time they accomplished that feat was in the 1995-1996 season. UP NEXT:  For the Wolves, Saturday vs. New York, Monday @ Orlando, Wednesday vs. Charlotte. For the Mavericks, Saturday vs. Portland, Monday vs. Clippers, Wednesday vs. Denver.
