 THE FACTS:   Monta Ellis  had a performance to remember, scoring 25 of his 39 points in the fourth quarter to rally the Milwaukee Bucks to a 115-109 victory over the Orlando Magic Sunday at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. 
 Ellis scored 19 points over the final 6:32 as he almost single-handedly rallied the Bucks (33-32) from a 97-85 deficit.  
 
 Aaron Afflalo  led Orlando (18-49) with 24 points, rookie  Maurice Harkless  had 23 and center  Nikola Vucevic  had 20 points and 15 rebounds. 
 
 Ersan Ilyasova  added 20 points and 11 rebounds for Milwaukee, which snapped a three-game losing streak.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It was just one of those days where you're feeling it. The crowd got into it and my teammates had faith in me to give me the ball and I was able to knock the shots down." 
 -- Ellis, whose 25 fourth-quarter points are the most for a player in a quarter this season. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Ellis went 5-for-5 on 3-pointers in the final 6:32. He entered the game shooting 24.2 percent from beyond the arc and missed his first one of the game. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  A layup by Afflalo with 6:45 left capped a 5-0 run that gave Orlando a 97-85 lead. Ellis answered with three 3-pointers over the next 68 seconds, igniting a 30-12 closing run. His final 3-pointer came with 13 seconds left and gave the Bucks a 113-109 lead. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Monta was pretty amazing there in the fourth quarter. ... I'm happy that we won the game but I'm really concerned with the way we're playing right now. It's not good enough. We need to be a better team. Right now we're not a very good team. You can't rely on scoring 45 points in the fourth quarter in order to pull a game out at home." 
 -- Bucks coach  Jim Boylan 
 
 
 HOT:  Who else but Ellis, who finished 13-for -2, including 8-of-0 in the fourth quarter. 
 
 NOT:   J.J. Redick  was playing against his former Magic teammates for the first time but went just 1-for -5, including 0- for-4 on 3-pointers.  
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Along with Ellis' huge 39-point performance, the Bucks had double-doubles from Ilyasova (20 points, 11 rebounds),  Brandon Jennings  (15 points, 14 assists) and  Larry Sanders  (13 points, 11 rebounds).   
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Bucks went almost exclusively to Ellis once he got hot, but the two times Orlando got the ball out of Ellis' hands, Jennings came up with huge deliveries. He assisted an Ilyasova layup that tied it at 108, then assisted an inside hoop by Sanders that gave the Bucks a 110-109 lead with 56.8 seconds left -- Milwaukee's first lead since 11-9 with 4:55 left in the first quarter. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Harkless' 23 points are a career-high, but he missed badly on an open 3-pointer with 1:44 left and then missed the first of two free throws with 1:08 left.  
 
 NOTABLE:  The Bucks entered the game at 16-16 at home, 16-16 on the road, 16-16 under former coach  Scott Skiles  and 16-16 under current coach Boylan. ... Milwaukee scored 45 points in the fourth quarter after scoring 44 in the first half. ... Ellis did not score in the first quarter and had just six at halftime. ... The Bucks are 10-11 all-time on St. Patrick's Day but 8-0 at home. ... Sanders has double-digit rebounds in each of his last four games. ... Orlando's  Tobias Harris  finished with 14 points and eight rebounds in his first game against his former team but did foul out in just 32 minutes of playing time.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Magic, Tuesday @ Indiana, Wednesday @ New York, Friday vs. Oklahoma City. For the Bucks, Tuesday vs. Portland, Wednesday @ Atlanta, Friday @ Indiana.
