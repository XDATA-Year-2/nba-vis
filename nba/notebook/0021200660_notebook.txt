 THE FACTS: Marc Gasol  scored a season-high 27 points,  Rudy Gay  scored 17 of his 26 points in the second half and the Memphis Grizzlies rallied from an early 17-point deficit for a gritty 103-100 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers Monday night at the Wells Fargo Center.  Jerryd Bayless  contributed a season-best 21 points and  Zach Randolph  swept 12 rebounds as the Grizzlies improved to 29-15. 
 
 Evan Turner  scored a season-high 27 points for the Sixers.  Thaddeus Young  added 23 points while  Jrue Holiday  had 18 and  Nick Young  13. But it wasn't quite enough and the Sixers fell to 18-26. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "It was like the last team to make the run was going to win. We were the last team." 
 -- Grizzlies coach  Lionel Hollins 
 
 
 THE STAT : The Sixers are 0-10 when the opponent shoots 50 percent or better this season. The Grizzlies shot 54.8 percent (40-for-73). 
 
 TURNING POINT : The Sixers took a 100-97 lead with 3:05 remaining. But they wouldn't score again, and Memphis managed the final six points of the game. The Sixers did have a chance to tie, but Gasol blocked Nick Young's 3-pointer from the baseline at the buzzer. 
 
 HOT : Gasol was 10-for-15 while Gay was 10-for-17. For the Sixers, Turner knocked down 12 of his 18 shots while Thaddeus Young was 11-for-19. 
 
 NOT : Randolph missed five of his seven shots and had a season-low four points. Nick Young missed eight of his 13 shots. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "We needed that. We showed some mental toughness." 
 -- Marc Gasol 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT : Gay played a stellar all around game and wound up with 26 points, seven rebounds, five assists and one blocked shot. Gasol was spectacular as well with 27 points, seven rebounds, seven assists, two steals and two blocked shots. Turner was solid for the Sixers with 27 points, seven assists, three rebounds and one steal. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA: Bobby Jones , a former standout with the Sixers and a member of their 1982-83 championship team, was honored before the game as part of an ongoing celebration of a 30-year anniversary of that title team. The crowd of 15,448 got louder and louder down the stretch as the game went down to the final possession. 
 
 QUOTABLE III : "I think our next step is closing off when we have leads. It's execution." 
 -- Evan Turner 
 
 GOOD MOVE : The Grizzlies ran their offense through Gay and Gasol in the waning minutes and it paid off. This duo made so many big plays and basically carried the Grizzlies to a victory. 
 
 BAD MOVE : After rallying from an early deficit, the Sixers once again couldn't find a way to hold a lead. Holiday probably could have penetrated more often to the basket. But the Sixers don't typically draw many fouls. They were just 6-for-9 from the free-throw line -- as a team. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH : Grizzlies guard  Tony Wroten  had six points and two rebounds in 12:54, while forward  Chris Johnson  had eight points in 25:53 off the bench. For the Sixers, forward  Arnett Moultrie  received a DNP-CD. 
 
 NOTABLE : Sixers guard  Jason Richardson  missed fourth straight game because of left knee synovitis. ... Grizzlies guard  Mike Conley  was out with a sprained left ankle. ... Injured All-Star center  Andrew Bynum  met with reporters about 45 minutes before tip-off and reiterated that he hopes to make his debut somewhere after the All-Star break, scheduled for Feb. 15-17. Bynum could practice for the first by the end of this week. "I have no idea," Bynum said. "It'll be up to the doctors at that point." ... The Sixers have given up 100 or more points in five of the past seven games and are 4-14 when allowing 100 or more this season. ... The Sixers have been outrebounded in 11 of the past 13 games. Memphis outrebounded the Sixers, 38-27. ... Holiday (18 points, 10 assists) registered his 12th double-double of the season. He had just one all of last season. ... The Sixers still haven't won consecutive games since a three-game streak from Nov. 25-30.
