  Notebook: Wizards 98, Pistons 77 Posted Sunday February 12, 2012 9:50PM By Dana Gauruder, for NBA.com THE FACTS: Center  JaVale McGee  and guard  Nick Young  scored 22 points apiece as the Washington Wizards notched their second road victory this season with a 98-77 win over the Detroit Pistons Sunday night. Point guard  John Wall  had nine second-half points and a career-high tying 15 assists for the Wizards. Center  Greg Monroe  led Detroit, which had its four-game winning streak snapped, with 27 points. QUOTABLE:  "I only took one shot in the first half. I wasn't being aggressive like I was the other games. I got that first basket to go in and found a rhythm. It opened up my teammates to make shots and made it tough for them to help on me. We did a great job of picking them apart and finding guys."   -- Wall on Washington's second-half surge. THE STAT:  27.3. The Pistons shot a season-low 32.6 percent from the field, including a 27.3 percent performance during the second half when they were outscored 53-32. Monroe was the only Piston to make more than one basket after halftime against the Wizards, who rank 24th in defensive field-goal percentage. TURNING POINT:  Wall went scoreless for 33 minutes but once he broke through, his team got rolling. Wall's drought ended with a three-point play to give Washington a 62-61 lead. That kicked off a 22-2 Wizards run spanning the third and fourth quarters. Young made a pair of 3-pointers during that stretch and rookie forward Jan Vesely finished it off with a dunk off a Wall feed for an 81-63 advantage. QUOTABLE II:  "They said I was breathing at 75 percent. I'm feeling a lot better. I feel like I can stay out there longer. I've just got to keep taking my medicine."   -- McGee, who recently had a change in medication for his asthma problems. HOT:  Coming off a season-high 24 points against Miami Friday, McGee continued his hot roll by making 10 of 13 shots. As usual, McGee did most of his damage above the rim. He converted six dunks and added two alley-oop layups. He also had a game-high 11 rebounds, five more than counterpart Monroe. NOT:  Detroit's guards had a miserable shooting night.  Rodney Stuckey ,  Brandon Knight ,  Ben Gordon ,  Walker Russell Jr . and  Will Bynum  shot a combined 6-for-36 (16.7 percent) from the field while scoring 22 points. They also committed eight of the team's 19 turnovers. GOOD MOVE:  Wizards coach  Randy Wittman  has shortened his big-man rotation, going with McGee,  Trevor Booker  (nine points, seven rebounds) and  Jan Vesely  (10 points, eight rebounds). Booker and Vesely did a solid job containing Detroit's power forwards and Vesely had the first double-digit scoring night of his career. BAD MOVE:  Pistons coach  Lawrence Frank  keeps giving  Austin Daye  minutes as  Tayshaun Prince's  backup at small forward and Daye keeps missing open shots. Daye went 2 for 9 from the field Sunday, including a blown fast-break layup attempt, and is now shooting 30.3 percent this season. NOTABLE:  Wizards forward  Rashard Lewis  reached the 15,000-point mark for his career with 10 points in 12 minutes. He now has 15,006. Lewis, who returned after missing three games because of a sore left knee, joins  Paul Pierce  and  Jason Kidd  as the only players in NBA history with 15,000 points, 5,000 rebounds and 1,500 3-pointers. ... Pistons center  Ben Wallace  tied  Avery Johnson's  record of 1,054 career games played by an undrafted player since the 1976-77 NBA-ABA merger with his 12-minute stint Sunday.  Moses Malone  holds the all-time record with 1,329 but was an ABA draft pick in 1974. ... Washington began a five-game road trip that includes four West Coast stops. ... The teams combined for 40 turnovers. UP NEXT:  For the Wizards, Tuesday @ Portland, Wednesday @ L.A. Clippers, Friday @ Utah. For the Pistons, Tuesday vs. San Antonio, Wednesday @ Boston, Friday vs. Sacramento.
