
 Wolves-Lakers notebook   By Bryan Chu, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday November 10, 2010 2:03AM THE FACTS:  Minnesota's  Kevin Love  finished with a career night, but the Timberwolves committed several turnovers as the Lakers capitalized, beating the Timberwolves 99-94 Tuesday at Staples Center. Los Angeles (8-0) has now won 12 straight over Minnesota (1-7), which has lost 17 straight on the road dating back to last season. The Lakers were led by  Kobe Bryant 's season-high 33 and  Pau Gasol 's 18 points and 10 rebounds. For the Timberwolves, Love tallied a team-high 23 points and snagged a career-high 24 rebounds, 11 offensive.  Michael Beasley  appeared to be the most aggressive he's been this season, finishing with 17 points and five steals. QUOTABLE:  "I think they're better than last year to be honest with you."   -- Kevin Love on Lakers THE STAT:  27 -- number of turnovers the Timberwolves committed. TURNING POINT:  After taking a 69-68 lead with 6:13 to go in the third period, the Timberwolves committed one unforced error after another. They turned the ball over five of their next six possessions, and the Lakers took advantage, rattling of a 14-2 spurt to go up 82-71. During the Lakers' run, the Timberwolves missed 10 straight shots. HOT:  No player was hotter than Love, who finished with his second career 20-20 game (his last one was against Phoenix on March 23, 2010 when he had 23 and 22). Love missed tying his career high in points by two. He tallied a double-double by halftime (12 points, 11 rebounds) and eclipsed his previous career-high of nine offensive rebounds by the 4:53 mark in the third quarter. NOT:  Outside of  Matt Barnes ' nine points, the Lakers' bench of  Steve Blake ,  Shannon Brown ,  Luke Walton  and  Theo Ratliff  combined for nine points on 3-for-13 shooting. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  For fantasy owners, it's good to see Bryant being aggressive, finishing with a season-high 33 points. But it took him 28 shots to reach that number. Though he wasn't efficient from the field, Bryant did add six rebounds, two 3-pointers and two steals. Filing in for the injured  Luke Ridnour  (hamstring) and  Jonny Flynn  (hip), journeyman  Sebastian Telfair  performed admirably, adding 13 points and nine assists. Telfair, who logged 39 minutes, may be a temporary fill-in with Flynn still 1-3 weeks away from returning. NOTABLE:  Timberwolves guard  Maurice Ager  banked in a halfcourt shot at the end of the third quarter ... The Lakers were held to under 100 points for the first time this season. UP NEXT:  For the Lakers, Thursday @ Denver, Sunday vs. Phoenix, Tuesday @ Milwaukee. For the Timberwolves, Wednesday at Sacramento, Friday vs. New York, Sunday vs. Atlanta.
