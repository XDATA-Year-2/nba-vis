 THE FACT:   Dirk Nowitzki  had a season-low nine points, but the Dallas Mavericks still managed to win.  
 
 THE LEAD:   Monta Ellis  had 23 points,  Vince Carter  scored 13 as the Mavericks defeated the Wizards 87-78 despite Nowitzki's 3-for-14 shooting. Dallas held Washington scoreless for more than four minutes as they outscored them 17-4 in the final five minutes.  
 
 John Wall  had 22 points and  Trevor Booker  had a career high 19 rebounds as the Wizards missed a chance to go over .500 for the first time since Oct. 31, 2009.  
 
 QUOTABLE:   "I was an expensive decoy today." - - Nowitzki, who was hampered when he rolled his left ankle in the game's first minute. 
 
 
 THE STAT:    Dallas won despite scoring just 87 points, equaling its season low. 
 
 TURNING POINT:   The Wizards took a 74-70 lead with just under five minutes to play, but didn't score again until Wall hit two free throws with 46.3 left.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It was an ugly game. I think we set the NBA back a couple of years." 
 -- Nowitzki on the lack of artistry on display. 
 
 
 HOT:   Ellis had 16 of his 23 points in the second half and hit nine of his 10 free throws. "I thought tonight was Monta Ellis' best game with us. He had such great command of the game offensively. He was under control, he was finding people, he only had one assist but he kept making the pass that lead to the pass that lead to the assist. And he made big plays and his string of free throws to end the game was the decisive factor. He played terrific," Dallas coach  Rick Carlisle  said.  
 
 NOT:   The Wizards shot just 37.5 percent as they missed their second opportunity of the season to rise above .500. "It's a great opportunity in front of us, and we continue to get there and we just lay an egg in the next game," Washington guard  Bradley Beal  said. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:   Ellis spent all summer trying to improve his free-throw shooting, and it's paid off this season. He hit all six of his foul shots in the fourth quarter.   
 
 BAD MOVE:   Wall was elbowed in his left eye late in the first quarter and wore a bandage after the game. He said he didn't know who hit him. 
 
 NOTABLE:   Shawn Marion  had nine points. His next point will be the 17,000th of his NBA career, the 82nd player to reach that plateau.  
 
 IN THE ARENA:   The attendance was 15,713. Washington has yet to sell out any of its league-low 13 home games this season.  
 
 UP NEXT:   For the Mavericks: Wednesday vs. L.A. Clippers, Friday vs. New York, Sunday vs. L.A. Lakers;  For the Wizards: Friday vs. Toronto, Sunday vs. Golden State, Tuesday @ Charlotte
