  Celtics-Sixers notebook   By Mike Radano, for NBA.com Posted Thursday December 9, 2010 11:47PM THE FACTS:   Kevin Garnett  converted a lob pass from  Rajon Rondo  with 1.4 seconds for a layup and gave the Celtics a 101-100 win over the Sixers at the Wells Fargo Center on Thursday night. The win was the ninth straight for the Celtics (18-4) and ended the Sixers' (7-15) five-game win streak at home. The Sixers are now 1-11 in games decided by 10 or less points. Veteran  Ray Allen  scored a game-high 23 points on 7-for-10 shooting from the field, including 2-for-3 from outside the arc. The Sixers had seven players in double figures for the game including a team-high 19 points from  Jodie Meeks . QUOTABLE:  "I keep saying that it's going to be scary when we get healthy. If we continue to win with the bodies that we're putting out there -- I really can't wait for February and March when we're healthy. We have to grind these wins out like we did tonight."   -- Celtics forward  Paul Pierce THE STAT:  The Sixers were able to stay in the game despite shooting 45.7 percent from the field (37-for-81) due to 15 offensive rebounds, including eight from  Elton Brand . TURNING POINT:  The Celtics ended the third quarter on an 11-0 run that gave Boston an 81-80 lead. The Celtics also had a 13-6 run at the end of the first half that gave them a 56-55 lead. TURNING POINT II:  Allen hit a 3-point shot with 1:04 left to give the Celtics a 98-97 lead. With :04 left on the shot clock, Allen found himself wide open in front of the Sixers' bench and hit nothing but net. The Sixers did score after Allen's shot but it set the stage for Garnett's heroics. QUOTABLE II:  "Obviously we don't want Ray Allen knocking down that three at that period of time. We were scrambling and fighting like crazy and somehow he shook loose. I told the guys we were down one and that's not the game."   --Sixers head coach  Doug Collins  on Allen's late 3-point shot THE STAT II:  The Celtics shot 7-for-12 from beyond the 3-point line, including 3-for-6 by guard  Nate Robinson . The Sixers were 9-for-19, including 4-for-5 by  Lou Williams , but it wasn't enough to secure a win as has been the case all season. In games the opponent has shot 40 percent or better from beyond the 3-point line the Sixers are just 1-7. HOT:  Rondo was 9-for-14 from the field and added 14 assists as he was permitted to easily drive the lane the entire night. NOT:   Andre Iguodala  scored 14 points but struggled from the field as he made just 5-of-14 shots on the night. GOOD MOVE:  With  Shaquille O'Neal  out with a sore right calf, Celtics head coach  Doc Rivers  went to rookie  Semih Erden ,   who scored eight points and pulled down three rebounds in 17:40 of game action. The move allowed Rivers to use  Glen Davis  off the bench and despite three quick fouls in the second quarter, Davis scored 16 points in 26:01 of court time. BAD MOVE:  The Sixers made several bad defensive switches late in the game with the two most notable allowing Allen a wide open three and the final play of the game in which  Jrue Holiday  was forced to guard Garnett.
