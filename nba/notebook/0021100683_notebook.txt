  Notebook: Bulls 94, Raptors 82 Posted Wednesday March 21, 2012 11:21PM By Duane Watson, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  The Chicago Bulls (39-10) defeated the Toronto Raptors (15-32) 94-82 for their sixth straight road win at the Air Canada Centre on Wednesday night. With point guard  Derrick Rose  missing his fifth straight game with a groin, reserve guard  John Lucas III  stepped up in the fourth quarter when it mattered. With a messy shooting performance by the Raptors (.463) and Bulls (.419) and the Chicago one turnover shy of their average with 13 after three quarters, the Raptors led 69-62. Lucas and  Kyle Korver  got going early in the fourth and went for 13 and 10 points respectively after being held scoreless prior. The Bulls outscored the Raptors 32-13 in the final frame and the Raptors shot 4-for-22 for the quarter (.222). The Raptors have lost three games in a row and are down 2-0 in the season series against the Bulls, which concludes on Saturday in Chicago. The Bulls have won three games in a row and were led by  Luol Deng  who had a team high 17 points and team high 10 rebounds,  C.J. Watson  scored 15 points and  Ronnie Brewer  added 12 points and 6 rebounds. The Raptors were led by  DeMar DeRozan's  game-high 23 points, while James Johnson added 16 with 7 rebounds. QUOTABLE:  "John can score and he's getting more comfortable out there the more he's playing. He's capable of hitting shots and we do a good job of recognizing that and making sure he gets his looks."   -- Bulls forward  Luol Deng  on Lucas' game. THE STAT:  The Bulls bench outscored the Raptors 32-30, however they had only scored 6 points until the fourth quarter. Lucas' 13 points off the bench in the fourth was equal to the entire Raptors team output as the Bulls outscored them 32-12 in the final frame. TURNING POINT:  As soon as the fourth quarter began it was the Bulls' game. Korver's 3-point basket to tie the game at 72-72 with 7:28 left in the fourth, was the game changer and was the culmination of a 10-3 run. The Bulls continued on a 13-2 run after tying the game to put it away for good. QUOTABLE II:  "This team, we have a lot of pieces that fit really well together. We all have different strengths and we try to play to our strengths and I think the fourth quarter tonight was about as well you can do playing to strengths."   -- Bulls guard  Kyle Korver HOT:  With only one assist after three quarters, Lucas arrived in the fourth. He scored or assisted on the first 16 points in the quarter for a 16-3 Chicago run. He finished the game with 13 points, 4 assists and 2 rebounds, keeping in place with his strong play of late averaging 14.5 points over the last 5 games. BAD MOVE:  Raptors head coach  Dwane Casey  failed to call a timeout during the Bulls 10-3 run in the fourth quarter, particularly when Korver tied the game 72-72 with 7:28 left. The Bulls then went on to reel off 12 unanswered points and the Raptors wouldn't score again from the field until 2:57 left in the game. NOTABLE:  It was the Raptors annual Canadian Forces Appreciation Night and the team debuted their alternate camouflage jersey... With the victory, the Bulls improve to 11-4 without Rose in the lineup... Raptors guard  Jerryd Bayless  left the game in the second quarter with a left hip pointer... The Bulls are currently riding a season-high six-game road winning streak... In two games this season; the Bulls have outscored Toronto 53-25 in the fourth quarter... Deng recorded his eight double-double of the season. UP NEXT:  The Raptors play on Friday vs. New York, Saturday @ Chicago and Monday vs. Orlando. The Bulls return home and play vs. Toronto on Saturday, Monday vs. Denver and Wednesday @ Atlanta.
