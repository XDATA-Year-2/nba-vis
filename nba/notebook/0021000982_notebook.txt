  Lakers-Mavericks notebook   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Sunday March 13, 2011 12:42AM THE FACTS:  Behind 22 points and 15 boards from  Andrew Bynum , Los Angeles survived an ankle injury to  Kobe Bryant  and 25-point nights by  Shawn Marion  and  Dirk Nowitzki  to earn a 96-91 victory Saturday in Dallas. The win was the 600th for  Phil Jackson  as head coach of the Lakers, who trimmed the Mavericks' lead in the race for the West's No. 2 playoff seed to just a half-game. Bryant rolled his left ankle after getting his jumper blocked by Marion late in the third quarter. He limped to the locker room for treatment and returned midway through the fourth quarter. His much-publicized practice effort following Thursday's loss in Miami didn't pay immediate dividends, as he finished with 16 points on 6-for-20 shooting. Jackson (600-287) is just the fifth coach in NBA history to win that many with one franchise, joining  Jerry Sloan  (Utah),  Red Auerbach  (Boston),  Gregg Popovich  (San Antonio) and  Red Holzman  (New York). Jackson also won 545 games with Chicago from 1989-98. QUOTABLE:  "We knew that Drew was going to be effective tonight. They have a big lineup, but he has shown before that he's a very effective player against the combination of what they put out there on the floor. We made a decided effort to go inside. We were able to get the ball in the right way and score. He replaced  Pau [Gasol]  as really our post scorer tonight."   -- Jackson on Bynum THE STAT:  Perhaps trying to test whether the Mavericks were indeed soft, as head coach  Rick Carlisle  stated earlier in the week, Los Angeles repeatedly attacked the basket in the early going. The Lakers scored 20 of their 22 first-quarter points in the paint and finished the game with a 56-38 advantage in that department. TURNING POINT:  The Lakers were clinging to a 65-63 lead when Bryant left the court at the 1:52 mark of the third quarter. That's when  Steve Blake  stepped up and knocked down two 3-pointers during an 8-0 run that stretched the lead to 10. QUOTABLE II:  "It's a tough loss. Obviously it's a game that had meaning. I'm disappointed with the outcome, but not the effort."   -- Carlisle, whose Mavericks have lost three of their last five games HOT:  The Lakers are 9-1 since the All-Star break. NOT:  The Mavericks were 4-for-16 from beyond the arc, snapping a streak of 35 consecutive games with at least six 3-pointers. That was the third-longest streak of all-time. ... Dallas missed 10 of its first 11 shots in the game and shot 38.6 percent from the field in the first half. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  It was the 10th double-double of the season for Bynum, the ninth for Marion (12 rebounds) and the 11th for Nowitzki (10 boards). It was the first time Dallas has lost this season (10-1) when Nowitzki notches a double-double. INSIDE THE ARENA:  The clash of Western Conference powers drew a record crowd of 20,619 fans at the American Airlines Center, topping the previous mark of 20,604 vs. San Antonio on Dec. 20, 2010. It was the 392nd straight sellout. ... During a timeout in the third quarter, one of those fans swished a half-court shot to win an 82-inch television. BAD MOVE:  Trailing 92-89 with less than 20 seconds to play, the Mavericks elected not to shoot from behind the arc and passed inside to  Jason Terry . Terry's 10-footer was off the mark with 12.9 seconds left and Bynum secured the rebound. Bynum made both free throws after getting fouled by Terry, icing the victory. NOTABLE:  The Lakers now begin a seven-game homestand that concludes with a March 31 contest against the Mavericks. ... Dallas is 11-16 this season when it fails to score at least 100 points. ... This was the first time the Mavericks have lost by more than one point since an 82-77 setback at Chicago on Jan. 20. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Tuesday @ Portland, Wednesday @ Golden State, Friday vs. San Antonio; For the Lakers, Monday vs. Orlando, Friday vs. Minnesota, March 20 vs. Portland.
