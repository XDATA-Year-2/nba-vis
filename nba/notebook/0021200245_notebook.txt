 THE FACTS: LaMarcus Aldridge  scored 25 points and grabbed 13 rebounds while  Nicolas Batum  scored five of his 17 in overtime as the Portland Trail Blazers shocked the Charlotte Bobcats with a 118-112 come-from-behind victory in overtime at Time Warner Cable Arena.  Ben Gordon  led all scorers with 29 points and in the process scored his 10,000 career point in the NBA. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We played great defense down the stretch and really crashed the boards and it worked out for us tonight. It was big for us. We needed shooters out there tonight and some guys really step up.  It makes us feel good, but it was tough out there tonight." --  Portland forward   Aldridge. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Aldridge is the first player with 25 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and three blocks in a game this season. Aldridge had a monster night for the Blazers in leading them to their second straight road overtime victory. He was 12-of-17 from the floor and collected his third consecutive 20-point game for the team.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  Portland gave up the first 12 points of the fourth quarter and seemed lost of offense. The Trail Blazers started the quarter shooting 1-of-7 with four turnovers. However, they quickly turned things around after the Bobcats opened the door. Batum drained a 3-point basket that kick started a 10-0 run by Portland.  Damian Lillard  then scored seven straight and the Blazers sliced the lead to single digits.  
 
 HOT:  Gordon was on fire for the Bobcats in the second half. Gordon scored 22 of his game-high 29 points in the second half and single handedly kept the Bobcats in the game. He set a franchise mark for most threes in a half with 7 and was 7-of-10 from the floor and 7-of-9 from behind the arc. Gordon is averaging 24.7 points in his three contests. He also set the franchise mark for 3s in a game with eight. Over his last five games, he has scored at least 19 points four times and is averaging 20.4 points and has connected on 23-of-36 from behind the arc. 
 
 NOT:  Charlotte's defense fell apart in the final 4:33 of the fourth quarter. The Bobcats led 97-79 but were outscored 23-5 down the stretch in the final period and 39-15 over the last 10:33 of the game.  
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Batum filled up the stat sheet against Charlotte Monday. The Portland forward had 19 points, 13 rebound, seven assists and added a steal and a block. Batum has had a Jekyll-and-Hyde road trip to date.  He averaged 14 points in the prior five games and alternated between double figure and single figure scoring. The last two games though Batum has flourished and so have the Blazers, he is averaging 19.5 points, 10.0 rebounds, 4.5 assists, 1.5 steals and 1.5 blocks in the two wins.  
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  Portland owner  Paul Allen  was in attendance at the game in Charlotte and sat courtside across from the Trail Blazers bench. Charlotte's owner,  Michael Jordan , was also in attendance and watched his team's implosion from his suite with longtime agent  David Falk .  
 
 ROOKIE WATCH: L illard scored 24 points and added a game-high nine assists. It was his 11th 20-plus point game this season.  He leads all rookies in scoring, assists, steals and minutes played. Since 1985, Lillard is just the third player to record 300 points & 100 assists in 1st 17 career games. The other two were  Allen Iverson  and  Derrick Rose. 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Charlotte guard  Gerald Henderson  returned to action after missing 13 games with a sprained left foot. Henderson scored five points in 15 minutes of action.  Kemba Walker  has scored in double figures in 15 of 16 games this season and gone for 20 or more on four occasions.  Byron Mullens  recorded his third double-double of the season while  Jeff Taylor  scored in double figures for the seventh time in eight games. The Bobcats made a season-high tying 13 three-point field goals.
