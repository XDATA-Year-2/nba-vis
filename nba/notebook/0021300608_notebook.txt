 THE FACT:  Charlotte has won seven straights against Toronto at home in Time Warner Cable Arena and 11 of the last 14 in the series with the last Toronto win in Charlotte coming on March 29, 2010. 
 
 THE LEAD: Ramon Sessions  scored a season-high 23 points and  Al Jefferson  had a 22-point, 19-rebound afternoon as the Charlotte Bobcats (18-25) held off the Toronto Raptors 100-95 Monday afternoon at Time Warner Cable Arena.  DeMar DeRozan  had a game-best 25 points for the Raptors (20-20) who rallied from a 30-point deficit to make it a one-possession game late in the fourth quarter.   
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Anytime you get up 30 points you get comfortable. Everybody got away from what they had done. We have to stay focused 48 minutes. We're not one of those teams that can go out and just play hard sometimes. We have to play hard 48 minutes especially with  Kemba (Walker)  out." --  Charlotte center Jefferson 
 
 
 THE STAT:  With 10 points and 10 rebounds in the first quarter, Jefferson became the first Bobcats player ever to record a double-double in the first quarter of a game. The last NBA player to do was  Reggie Evans  on April 9, 2013, when he had 10 points and 10 rebounds for the Brooklyn Nets against Philadelphia. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Midway through the third quarter it seemed like the Bobcats were going to run away with the game. Toronto however went on a run that changed the tone of the game. Trailing 71-41, the Raptors closed the third quarter on a 19-7 run that included a pair of 3s from  Steve Novak . That run enabled the Raptors to put pressure on the Bobcats throughout the fourth and get as close as a point on one occasion. The Bobcats however went 7-for-8 at the free throw line in the final minute to seal the win.  
 
 HOT: Kyle Lowry  had 14 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter. He was 6-for-8 from the floor as the Raptors comeback fell short. Lowry has averaged 21.4 points and hit 19 of his 38 shots from the 3-point line in his last five games 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Bobcats center Jefferson scored 22 points, grabbed 19 rebounds and handed out a career-high-tying seven assists, tallying his 17th double-double of the season. Jefferson posted his third consecutive game with at least 20 points and 10 rebounds, marking the fourth time in franchise history that a player has posted three straight games with 20 points and 10 rebounds. Jefferson grabbed at least 14 rebounds for the third consecutive game.  
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  Many players for both Toronto and Charlotte were sporting purple shoes in honor of  Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . Both teams also wore special shooting shirts in honor of the MLK holiday. The Bobcats had numerous in-game tributes to Dr. King including a choir and recitation of the "I Have a Dream" speech during halftime.  
 
 ROOKIE WATCH: Cody Zeller  played 15 minutes and scored two points, had two assists and grabbed one rebound. Toronto's rookie  Dwight Buycks  did not play.  
 
 NOTABLE:  Charlotte allowed a season-low 36 points in the first half ... the Bobcats are now 2-7 when hosting a game on Martin Luther King Jr. Day ... Charlotte is now 17-12 when shooting more free throws that their opponent. The Bobcats were 27-for-33 while the Raptors were 7-for-10 ...  Gerald Henderson  scored 16 points, scoring in double figures for the 38th time this season ...  Jannero Pargo  scored a season-high 11 points and handed out a season-high four assists ... Raptors forward  Chuck Hayes  scored 12 points and grabbed a season-high 13 rebounds, tallying his first double-double of the season ...  Greivis Vasquez  tallied 15 points, nine assists and seven rebounds, posting his high in each category since coming to Toronto ... Charlotte is now 10-2 when scoring 100 or more on the season. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Raptors, Wednesday vs. Dallas, Friday @ Philadelphia, Saturday vs. Clippers. For the Bobcats, Wednesday vs. Clippers, Friday @ Knicks, Saturday vs. Chicago.
