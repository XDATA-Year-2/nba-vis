  Suns-Mavericks notebook   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Monday April 11, 2011 12:24AM THE FACTS:   Dirk Nowitzki  scored 19 points and  Shawn Marion  added 18 points and 11 rebounds as the Mavericks rolled to a 115-90 win against the Suns on Sunday in Dallas, completing their first season sweep (4-0) against Phoenix since 1986-87. Jason Terry  and  Peja Stojakovic  each scored 17 points and  J.J. Barea  added 15. Tyson Chandler had 12 boards and  Brendan Haywood  grabbed 11 as Dallas posted a 51-37 advantage on the glass. The Mavericks, trying to catch the Lakers for the West's No. 2 playoff seed, shot 50.6 percent from the field and 40.7 percent (11-for-27) from 3-point range. QUOTABLE:  "They made shots and we didn't make shots. When you do that, you're going to get behind. We were on our heels right from the start. That's what the game was. Thanks."   -- Phoenix head coach  Alvin Gentry , whose team has dropped eight of its last 10 games. THE STAT:  Phoenix missed its first 16 shots from behind the arc until  Aaron Brooks  finally connected with 7:19 remaining in the game. The Suns finished 2-for-20. In their last meeting against Dallas, a 91-83 loss in Phoenix on March 27, they were 1-for-16 from 3-point distance. TURNING POINT:  The Mavericks led wire-to-wire with well-rested point guard  Jason Kidd  running the show. Kidd, 38, who sat out the two previous games, tallied seven points, seven assists and three steals as Dallas enjoyed its most explosive offensive output since a 127-109 victory against the Knicks on March 10. QUOTABLE II:  "Tonight you saw how good we can play when we play as a team. Running up and down and playing in the flow is a key for us, and we really had a great rhythm to our game tonight and it made for a blowout."   --Jason Terry HOT:  The Mavericks led 36-17 after the first quarter, their highest-scoring opening stanza of the season. They scored 35 against the Pacers on March 4. Eight different players contributed to the total for Dallas, topped by Nowitzki and Marion with eight points each. NOT:  Phoenix went 1-4 on its five-game road trip to finish the season 17-24 away from home, including 9-17 against Western Conference opponents and just 1-8 against the Southwest Division. The loss also guarantees that the Suns (38-42) will end the season under .500 for the first time since 2003-04. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  It was the third consecutive double-double and the 12th of the season for Marion. "The Matrix" topped all players with six offensive rebounds and added two assists, one steal and one blocked shot. GOOD MOVE:  Since being inserted to the Suns' starting lineup nine games ago, Suns center  Marcin Gortat  has averaged 14.2 points and 11.1 rebounds while shooting 53.1 percent (52-for-98). NOTABLE:  Terry's third 3-pointer of the game, midway through the fourth quarter, was his 1,000th in a Mavericks uniform. Nowitzki (1,196) is the only other player in franchise history to reach that milestone. Terry, who played five seasons with Atlanta from 1999-2004, has 1,648 career treys. ... Dallas is 12-1 when scoring 110-plus points. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Monday @ Houston, Wednesday vs. New Orleans. For the Suns, Monday vs. Minnesota, Wednesday vs. San Antonio.
