 THE FACTS:   One of the best defensive teams in the NBA suddenly has unlocked an explosive offense, and the result has been devastating. Indiana shot a season-high 56.2 percent from the field and rolled to its second consecutive demolition job, 114-82, over the visiting Detroit Pistons Friday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. After building a 39-point lead in smacking the Knicks 125-91 on Wednesday, the Pacers (34-21) pushed their margin to 43 points in the fourth quarter before settling for their second consecutive victory by more than 30 points. Six Indiana players scored in double figures, led by  David West  with 18,  George Hill  with 15 and rookie  Orlando Johnson  with a season-high 14. Detroit, which lost its 10th straight trip to Indianapolis, a streak that dates back to 2008, was led by  Will Bynum' s 17 points off the bench. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Our guys are coming out and starting games with incredible energy and determination. Our offense is really coming." 
 -- Indiana Coach  Frank Vogel 
 
 
 THE STAT:  In two blowout wins out of the All-Star break, the Pacers have won by a total of 66 points, shot .546 from the field and .552 from the 3-point line. The defense, meanwhile, has limited opponents to .345 shooting overall, .170 from the arc.   
 
 TURNING POINT:  Much like Wednesday night, when they bolted to a 22-10 lead on the Knicks and didn't look back, the Pacers hit the floor at full speed, jumping to a 13-2 lead and pushing it to 29-10.  With a 24-point lead at halftime, they then held the Pistons nearly 6 1/2 minutes without a field goal and turned it from a yawner into a laugher, pushing the lead to 70-39 before Detroit found the hoop. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We've just been playing extremely hard. We're taking this very seriously. We've been sharing the ball and just being good teammates. It's a hot potato out there and everybody is getting a touch." 
 -- Indiana center  Roy Hibbert 
 
 
 HOT:  Johnson enjoyed a perfect shooting night, hitting all five of his shots, three from the 3-point line. In the last 11 games he has gone 14-for-19 (.736) from the arc while averaging 5.9 points off the bench. ... Detroit rookie  Slava Kravtsov  had his first career double-double with 14 points and 10 rebounds, shooting 6-for-7, though he missed eight of his 10 free-throw attempts. 
 
 NOT:  Detroit's starters combined to shoot 11-for-40 (.275), 0-for-6 from the 3-point line. ... Indiana's  Paul George  committed a career-high seven turnovers.  
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "You with Indiana it's all about blitzkrieg. They blitzkrieged New York, they blitzkrieged us. There is no surprise about what they did. It's about what they put into the game, the purpose they played with, the effort, the physicality and the passion." 
  -- Detroit Coach  Lawrence Frank  
 
 
 NOTABLE:   The Pacers raised their season high from 28 assists, established Wednesday, to 29. ... All five Indiana starters scored in double figures for the eighth time. ... George extended his streak of games with at least one steal to 15, matching the Pacers' longest streak since  Jamaal Tinsley  (15) in 2007. The franchise record is 26, set by  Vern Fleming  in 1986. ...   Danny Granger  practiced three days this week but was not able to make his season debut tonight. Granger, who has yet to play this season with patellar tendinosis in his left knee, traveled with the team to Detroit and has not been ruled out for the rematch Saturday night. ... The Pistons were without second-leading scorer  Brandon Knight  (hyperextended right knee). Knight may have an MRI tomorrow but could play Saturday. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Pacers, Saturday at Detroit, Tuesday vs. Golden State, Thursday vs. L.A. Clippers. For the Pistons, Saturday vs. Indiana, Monday vs. Atlanta, Wednesday at Washington.
