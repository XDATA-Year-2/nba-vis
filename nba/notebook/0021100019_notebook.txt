  Heat-Celtics notebook   By Shandel Richardson, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday December 28, 2011 12:15AM THE FACTS:  The Miami Heat defeated the Boston Celtics 115-107 Tuesday at AmericanAirlines Arena, but not before holding off Boston's furious fourth-quarter rally. Heat rookie guard  Norris Cole  scored 20 points, 14 in the final period, to help Miami improve to 2-0. Miami's Big Three of  LeBron James  (26 points, six rebounds, five assists),  Dwyane Wade  (24 points eight assists) and  Chris Bosh  (18 points, 11 rebounds) led the way. They were assisted by forwards  Udonis Haslem  (12 points) and  James Jones  (nine points, 3-for-3 on 3-pointers). Boston was led by guard  Ray Allen  (28 points, six 3-pointers), guard  Rajon Rondo  (22 points, eight rebounds, 12 assists, seven turnovers), guard  Keyon Dooling  (18 points), center  Brandon Bass  (13 points) and forward  Kevin Garnett  (12 points). QUOTABLE:  "We will get better against the zone."   -- Heat coach  Erik Spoelstra THE STAT:  Boston committed 24 turnovers and Miami turned them into 33 points. In the first half Miami turned 15 Boston turnovers into 23 points, TURNING POINT:  Miami's 39-point second quarter did the job on Boston's comeback hopes. The Celtics closed within 42-35 but the Heat went on a 15-5 run to take a 54-40 lead and take the Celtics' spirit. HOT:  Heat forward James Jones, the defending Three-Point champion at All-Star weekend, is 6-for-8 on 3-pointers. COLD:  Celtics center  Jermaine O'Neal  had no points and no rebounds through three quarters. His two-game totals are 3.0 points and 1.5 rebounds per game. NOTABLE:  Boston's  Chris Wilcox  (left shoulder) left in the second quarter and didn't return ... Boston's  Paul Pierce  (heel) is likely out for tonight's game at New Orleans ... Boston went to a zone defense in the fourth quarter and it worked as his Celtics cut their deficit from 15 points to three (at 108-105). UP NEXT:  For the Heat, Wednesday @ Charlotte, Friday @ Minnesota, Monday vs. Charlotte. For Boston, Wednesday @ New Orleans, Friday vs. Detroit, Monday @ Washington.
