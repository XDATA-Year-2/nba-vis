
 Sixers-Rockets notebook   By Matt Miller, for NBA.com Posted Thursday February 17, 2011 12:01AM THE FACTS:   Jrue Holiday  scored a team-high 20 points on 8-for-11 shooting to lead seven 76ers in double figures, as Philadelphia used a hot shooting night to hold off the Houston Rockets 114-105 Wednesday at Toyota Center.  Lou Williams  and  Thaddeus Young  each added 19 points for the Sixers (27-29), who have won five of their last seven road games.  Kyle Lowry  (career-high 36 points, seven assists) and  Luis Scola  (26 points, 13 rebounds) combined for 62 points, but it was not enough for Houston (26-31) to overcome Philadelphia's 55.2 percent shooting effort. QUOTABLE:  "Just to feel the energy in the locker room after the game, the guys were really happy. That makes me feel good because I didn't know that I would see this joy this year with this group with the way we started. ... We had to really work hard to make this happen."  --  Sixers coach  Doug Collins  on Philadelphia's turnaround from a 3-13 start. THE STAT:  Wednesday's win is the Sixers' 27th of the season, matching their win total from last season. TURNING POINT:  Houston made four consecutive layups to climb within 101-96 with less than three minutes remaining. But the Sixers responded by scoring six points in a row, allowing the Rockets zero offensive rebounds during this stretch, to put the game out of reach. QUOTABLE II:  "We didn't guard them all night long."  --  Rockets coach  Rick Adelman  on his team's lack of defensive intensity HOT:  Lowry shot 15-for-18 from the floor, marking the first time he has hit more than half of his shots in a game since Feb. 2. Lowry also set a new career high by drilling six of nine attempts from beyond the arc. NOT:  Sixers forward  Andre Iguodala  posted his first triple-double (13 points, 12 rebounds, 10 assists) since 2007, but his shooting struggles continued. Including Wednesday's 3-for-15 effort, Iguodala has connected on only 10 of 46 field-goal attempts (21.7 percent) over the last four games. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  No Rocket could use a break more than  Kevin Martin , who has disappointed fantasy owners of late. Martin has averaged 15.5 points on 18-for-53 (34 percent) shooting overall, including 26.1 percent shooting from behind the arc, in the last four games. ROOKIE WATCH:  The Sixers'  Evan Turner  was locked in with Philadelphia's offensive rhythm, scoring 10 points on 5-for-9 shooting. He also pulled down six rebounds during his 31-plus minutes on the court. NOTABLE:  Sixers center  Spencer Hawes  (sprained left ankle) went to the locker room during the third quarter and did not return. He said the injury is not serious and will not keep him out action. ... Philadelphia has won six of its last seven meetings with the Rockets. ... The Sixers' bench shot 24-for-39 (61.5 percent) and outscored Houston's reserves 54-23. ... Philadelphia improved to 2-17 this season when allowing at least 100 points. ... The Sixers entered the 2009-2010 All-Star break 12 games under .500 (20-32). UP NEXT:  For the 76ers, Feb. 23 vs. Washington, Feb. 25 vs. Detroit, Feb. 27 @ Cleveland. For the Rockets, Tuesday @ Detroit, Feb. 23 @ Cleveland, Feb. 26 vs. New Jersey.
