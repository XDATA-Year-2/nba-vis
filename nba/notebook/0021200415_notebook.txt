 THE FACTS:   Brandon Jennings  scored 25 points and had six assists, and  Monta Ellis  played a complete game with 20 points, seven assists, six rebounds and six steals to lead the Milwaukee Bucks to a 108-93 victory over the Brooklyn Nets Wednesday night at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. 
 
 Ersan Ilyasova  had a double-double off the bench with 17 points and 11 rebounds,  Mike Dunleavy  added 17 points off the bench and Larry Sanders had 12 points and 12 rebounds as the Bucks improved to 15-12. 
 
 Brook Lopez  led the Nets (14-14) who played without star guard Deron Williams, who sat out with a sore right wrist. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I'm a machine. I don't even feel it. It just looks bad. It don't hurt." 
 -- Ellis, joking after being asked about his red right eye, which was poked by Brooklyn's  Reggie Evans  late in the third quarter  
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Bucks hit 10 of their 17 3-pointers for 58.8 percent, while the Nets made just 4 of 21 for 19 percent. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Despite being without Williams, the Nets managed to hang around and were within 84-80 after rookie  Tyshawn Taylor's  3-pointer with 8:51 left. Then Ilyasova, Ellis and Dunleavy hit 3-pointers to start a 21-9 run, and it was over. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Some nights you have to do a little more. The opportunity presented itself and I just took advantage of it." 
 -- Ellis on his stat line with seven assists, six rebounds and six steals 
 
 
 HOT:  Ellis made all three of his 3-pointers after entering the game shooting just 20.9 percent from behind the arc. 
 
 NOT:   C.J. Watson  started in place of Williams and made just 2 of 12 shots. Star forward Joe Johnson didn't pick up the slack, either, going 5 for 15. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Ellis had his best all-around game of the season with his line of 20 points, 7 assists, 6 rebounds and 6 steals.   
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  Former Bucks coach and general manager  Mike Dunleavy Sr . was in attendance to watch his son  Mike Dunleavy  Jr. and chatted afterward with Bucks owner  Herb Kohl , the retiring U.S. Senator. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Starting forwards  Luc Richard Mbah a Moute  and  Marquis Daniels  didn't have productive nights, so reserves Ilyasova and Dunleavy played the lion's share of minutes for the Bucks. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Rookie  Tyshawn Taylor  saw 20 minutes of playing time backing up Watson and made 3 of 6 shots for seven points.  
 
 NOTABLE:  The Bucks have now won 13 straight games against the Nets dating back to 2009. The last time the Nets beat Milwaukee was March 3, 2009, a 99-95 decision in Milwaukee. ... Williams missed his first game of the season with a sore right wrist. He entered the game shooting just 39.8 percent on the season. Nets coach  Avery Johnson  said the Nets hoped to have Johnson back for their home game Friday against Charlotte. ... Bucks backup point guard  Beno Udrih  returned after missing 12 games with a sprained right ankle. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Nets, Friday vs. Charlotte, Saturday vs. Cleveland, Monday @ San Antonio. For the Bucks, Saturday vs. Miami, Sunday @ Detroit, Wednesday vs. San Antonio.
