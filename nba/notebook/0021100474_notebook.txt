  Notebook: Mavericks 89, Celtics 73 Posted Monday February 20, 2012 11:48PM By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  It was "Milestone Monday" for the Mavericks as  Dirk Nowitzki  moved into 20th place on the NBA's all-time scoring list and  Jason Kidd  climbed to second place in steals, leading Dallas to an 89-73 victory over the slumping Celtics at the American Airlines Center. Boston (15-16) has dropped four straight and six out of seven to slip below .500, while the defending champion Mavericks (21-12) have won seven of eight. On a three-point play with 5:55 left in the first quarter, Nowitzki passed Celtics great  Robert Parish  (23,334 points) for 20th place on the NBA's all-time scoring list. Nowitzki (23,354) tallied 26 points, a season-high 16 rebounds and two blocks, including the 1,000th rejection of his career. Kidd picked off a  Ray Allen  pass at 5:59 of the second quarter to move past  Michael Jordan  (2,514). He now trails only  John Stockton  in the league history books for both assists and thefts. The shorthanded Celtics were without stars  Kevin Garnett  (personal reasons) and  Rajon Rondo , who served the first night of a two-game league suspension for throwing the ball at an official during Sunday's loss at Detroit.  Paul Pierce  paced Boston with 20 points.  Ray Allen  (15) and  Avery Bradley  (12) also scored in double figures and  Mickael Pietrus  pulled down 12 boards. QUOTABLE: "They were two men down without Rondo and K.G., so a different ball club. They tried to junk up the game and I thought we did an excellent job of being patient and getting what we wanted on the offensive end."   -- Mavericks guard  Jason Terry THE STAT:  With his rejection of Bradley at the 9:30 mark of the first quarter, Nowitzki became just the third player in NBA history with 1,000 career blocks and 1,000 3-pointers, joining  Clifford Robinson  (1,253 treys, 1,390 blocks) and  Rasheed Wallace  (1,064 treys, 1,445 blocks). Nowitzki has 1,001 blocked shots and 1,221 3-pointers. TURNING POINT:  A personal 10-2 run by Nowitzki (four free throws and three midrange jumpers) in the second quarter stretched the Mavs' lead to 37-23. Dallas led by double digits the rest of the way. QUOTABLE II:  "We're losing, No. 1, because we're not playing well; No. 2, because we are injured. So why shake things up if guys are injured? I think you've got to let them get healthy if they can. I think  Danny [Ainge]  is always going to look for trades. I think you know who Danny is. But having said that, I don't think Danny is going to do anything crazy."   -- Celtics head coach  Doc Rivers HOT:  Nowitzki's career average of 26.9 points per game against the Celtics is his highest against any opponent. He had 21 points and 10 rebounds by halftime. NOT:  The Celtics managed only 15 points in the first quarter and 34 points in the first half against the Mavericks, who are No. 1 in the NBA in field-goal defense (41.5 percent). BAD MOVE:  Already playing without Garnett and forward  Brandon Bass  (sore left knee), the Celtics lost two more big men in the third quarter as starters  Jermaine O'Neal  (sprained left wrist) and  Chris Wilcox  (right adductor strain) exited with injuries. "I'm scared to talk to the medical staff because they don't really give you good news," Rivers said. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Terry contributed 16 points, six assists and five boards off the Dallas bench. He was 4-for-7 from 3-point distance, while the rest of the team was 3-for-18. ROOKIE WATCH:  All three Celtics rookies saw action in the lopsided loss.  JaJuan Johnson  had eight points and five rebounds,  E'Twaun Moore  sank two 3-pointers and  Greg Stiemsma  grabbed five boards. NOTABLE:  Boston has already used 11 different starting lineups through 31 games. ... The Mavericks completed their second straight season sweep against the Celtics. ... It was the fourth wire-to-wire victory of the season for Dallas. ... The Mavericks outscored the Celtics 32-18 in the paint and scored 25 points off 17 Boston turnovers. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Wednesday vs. Los Angeles Lakers, Feb. 28 vs. New Jersey, Feb. 29 @ Memphis. For the Celtics, Wednesday @ Oklahoma City, Feb. 28 @ Cleveland, Feb. 29 vs. Milwaukee.
