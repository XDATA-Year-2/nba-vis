  Bulls-Suns notebook   By Mike Tulumello, for NBA.com Posted Thursday November 25, 2010 1:24AM THE FACTS:  The Chicago Bulls, down 25-6 at the game's start, put together rally after rally to narrow the gap, then pull out a dramatic 123-115 double-overtime win Wednesday night at the Phoenix Suns. The Bulls dominated the second overtime, whipping the Suns 12-4, as  Derrick Rose  scored five and  Kyle Korver  went 4-for-4 from the free-throw line. For the game, Rose had 35 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists.  Luol Deng  had 26 points and 10 boards, while Korver added 24 off the bench. For the Suns,  Grant Hill  scored 27 and  Steve Nash  had 14 points and 16 assists. The Suns had led nearly wire to wire, including a 36-13 lead late in the first quarter. The Bulls, playing their fourth game in five nights, narrowed the gap to 62-50 at halftime but they still trailed 99-94 with 2:29 left in regulation. James Johnson 's 3-pointer cut the Suns' lead to 99-97. Then Johnson hit a fast-break layup to give the Bulls their first tie at 99-99 with 46 seconds left. In between, a frantic Bulls' defense forced the Suns into several disjointed possessions, as they only scored two points in the final 2:29, a pair of Nash free throws to give the Suns a brief 101-99 lead with 21 seconds left. Then Rose hit two free throws to tie it with 14.7 seconds left. Hill missed a 17-footer to win it for the Suns at the buzzer. The teams traded hoops in overtime, with the Suns'  Jason Richardson  hitting a huge 3-pointer to give the Suns a 108-107 lead with 1:04 left. But Richardson left an opening by hitting only 1-for-2 free throws with 5.5 seconds left, giving the Suns a 111-109 lead. Rose, taking a perfect pass from  Joakim Noah , hit a reverse layup with .1 second left to send the game to a second overtime. The Bulls'  Taj Gibson  didn't play because of a sore ankle. QUOTABLE:  "We're learning how to win. We're not there yet, but we're moving in the right direction."   -- Bulls coach  Tom Thibodeau . THE STAT:  The Suns turned it over eight times in the fourth quarter, while hitting only six shots (1-for-16) as the Bulls outscored them 29-17 to send the game to overtime. TURNING POINT:  Johnson's 3-pointer with 2:20 left gave the Bulls a chance by cutting the Suns' lead to 99-97. QUOTABLE II:  "Forty eight minutes for Steve Nash is too damn many. ... We've got to get the bench playing well again."   -- Suns coach  Alvin Gentry  on play of bench. Nash's backup  Goran Dragic , in particular has struggled lately. An exception is forward  Hakim Warrick , who scored 23 of the Suns' 28 bench points. HOT:  The 38-year-old Hill, given the Suns' toughest defensive assignment (on Rose, who shot 14-for-33) shot 12-for-20 for 27 points. He'd just finished a four-game road trip in which he averaged 19.0 points on 57 percent shooting. NOT:   Jared Dudley , one of the NBA's better reserves last season, is shooting 33 percent after hitting just 1-for-6 vs. the Bulls. NOTABLE:  The Suns ranked No. 30, yes, that's last place, in the key stat of defensive field-goal percentage heading into Wednesday's game vs. the Bulls. "Our initial defense is pretty good," Gentry said. "Where we run into trouble are the second-chance points. We're not closing out possessions. "Last year, we almost got to the point where we almost made the top 10 (in defensive shooting percentage). If we're a middle-of the pack team, we're in pretty good shape. We can't be dead last." UP NEXT:  The next three games for each team, in this format. For the Bulls, Friday @ Denver, Saturday @ Kings, Wednesday @ vs. Magic. For the Suns, Friday vs. Clippers, Sunday @ Denver and Thursday @ Golden State.
