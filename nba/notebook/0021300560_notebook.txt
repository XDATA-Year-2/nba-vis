 THE FACT:  Since  Nikola Vucevic  (concussion) went down on Jan. 6, the Magic have lost four consecutive games by an average of 20.3 points. 
 
 THE LEAD: Monta Ellis  scored 21 points and  Dirk Nowitzki  added 15 to pace the Mavericks to a 107-88 win over the Orlando Magic on Monday night at the American Airlines Center. 
 Dallas (23-16) jumped out to an early eight-point lead in the first quarter and never looked back, upping the advantage to as many as 22. Six Mavericks scored in double figures, including  Vince Carter , who added 17 off the bench.  Jameer Nelson  led the way for Orlando (10-28), contributing 21 points. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "They're not just going to give you the game, so you've got to play. They made a couple of runs at us. We did a good job of getting the lead back up in the game. It's good. ... We've got a lot of big games coming up." 
 -- Mavericks coach  Rick Carlisle 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Dallas' second unit was stellar all night long, outscoring the Magic's reserves 42-14. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Up by six early in the second quarter, the Mavericks orchestrated a 14-3 run to give them a 44-27 lead. They would lead the rest of the way. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I'm not really happy at all. I'm happy to be alive, I'm happy to be able to breathe, but right now as a competitor I'm not happy at all. It's good to go home, but at the same time it doesn't mean anything if we don't go out there and do what we need to do. We can be home all we want but fans can't play for us." 
 -- Orlando forward  Glen Davis 
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:   Maurice Harkless  filled the stat sheet, posting 13 points, seven rebounds, three assists and two steals. ... Davis tallied 19 points and eight rebounds. ... Carter connected on three 3-pointers and shot 60 percent from the field.  
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:   Victor Oladipo  scored 11 points in 30 minutes. ...  Gal Mekel  posted a team-high seven assists off the bench. 
 
 NOTABLE: Wayne Ellington  recorded a season-high 12 points for the Mavericks. ... Nowitzki became the 24th player in NBA history with 1,400 3-pointers. ... Dallas advanced to seven games over .500 for the first time this season. ... Orlando lost its eighth consecutive game. ... Orlando's  Arron Afflalo  (foot) missed his second consecutive game. ...
