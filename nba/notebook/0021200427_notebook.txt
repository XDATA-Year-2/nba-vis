 THE FACTS :  Backed by a resurgent  Deron Williams  with 19 points and  Brook Lopez  with 26 points and 11 rebounds, the Nets crushed the Bobcats 97-81, sending Charlotte to its 17th-straight defeat. In  P.J. Carlesimo 's coaching debut for the Nets (15-14), they were never really challenged. 
 
 QUOTABLE :  "We got off to a great start. We executed very well and I thought we passed the ball and set screens better than we have been setting them."  
 -- P.J. Carlesimo 
 
 THE STAT : The Nets held the Bobcats (7-22) to 28-percent shooting in the first quarter.   
 
 TURNING POINT : The Bobcats never led. A  Keith Bogans  corner 3, the game's first basket, is where the game turned for the first -- and last -- time.   
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA : Nets owner  Mikhail Prokhorov  gave an interview at halftime to discuss the firing of  Avery Johnson  and his current support of Carlesimo. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "We need to give support to our head coach. I don't want to start any kind of rumors and speculation."  
 -- Mikhail Prokhorov 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH :  Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  (three points, 1-for-6 shooting, four rebounds) struggled for the Bobcats.  Jeffrey Taylor  saw 19 minutes of action for Charlotte. 
 
 NOTABLE :  Williams scored more points in the first half than he did in any of his previous four games. ...  Bogans sank all three of his 3-point attempts. He has now hit 12 of his last 18 from long range. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Bobcats, Saturday vs. New Orleans, Monday @ Chicago, Friday vs. Cleveland. For the Nets, Saturday vs. Cleveland, Monday vs. San Antonio, Wednesday vs. Oklahoma City.
