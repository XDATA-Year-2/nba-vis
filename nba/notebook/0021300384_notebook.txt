 THE FACT:  The Hawks, who set a season high in scoring two nights ago, have now scored more than 110 points in three straight games -- a season best. 
 
 THE LEAD: Lou Williams  scored a game-high 25 points off the bench, and  Al Horford  scored 23 in fewer than 23 minutes, as the Atlanta Hawks led wire-to-wire in routing the Utah Jazz 118-85 Friday night at Philips Arena.  
 The 85 points allowed were a season-low for Atlanta (15-12), which led by as much as 33 in the fourth quarter in extending its current winning streak to three games, all at home. The Jazz (7-22), who had won three of their previous four road games, fell to 4-12 away from home, 1-6 on the road against the East.   
 Hawks forward  Paul Millsap  had his team-best 10th double-double (14 points, 10 rebounds) in his first game against the Jazz, for whom he played for his first six NBA seasons (2006-13). Former Hawk first-round pick  Marvin Williams , who spent his first seven seasons in Atlanta (2005-12), had six points and six rebounds in his return to Philips Arena. 
 
 THE STAT:  8-for-13: Atlanta's top two shooting guards, former Jazz guard  Kyle Korver  and Williams, who replaced Korver, shot a combined 8-for-13 (61.6 percent) from behind the arc, with Williams going 6-for-10 and Korver 2-for-3. The rest of the Hawks went 2-for-13 from 3, while Utah's entire roster made only 3-for-18 of their 3-point attempts. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Utah trailed 18-10 with 4:42 remaining in the first quarter, when Jazz Coach  Tyrone Corbin  took  Trey Burke  out of the game. Burke had picked up his second foul seconds earlier. Utah shot 2-for-11 the rest of the quarter, missing its final seven shots, and Atlanta finished on a 12-6 run, pushing the lead into double-digits, where it stayed the rest of the game.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I made good shots. I missed a few that I thought I should've made ? a few jump shots ? being the perfectionist I am. Our energy was the difference tonight."  
 -- Atlanta forward Al Horford, who missed only four shots all night 
 
 
 HOT:  Horford was unstoppable all night. He hit his first three field goal attempts, went 11-for-15 on the night and never missed back-to-back shots. His 23 points came in 22:38 over the first three quarters.   
 
 NOT:  Utah's back court of Hayward and Burke, which combined for 45 points on 18-for-35 shooting Wednesday night in the win at Orlando, combined for 13 points on 5-for-22 shooting, 1-for-7 from 3...Guard  Alec Burks , who had 13 and finished 6-for-12, made most of that up in the second half, as he had two points and shot 1-for-6 in the first 24 minutes. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Burke had a difficult night against the tandem of  Jeff Teague  and  Shelvin Mack . He had only two points, shooting 1-for-8, 0-for-3 from long range, and didn't get to the foul line. It was his second 1-for-8 night in three games, with the two games sandwiching his incredible Wednesday night in Orlando. His three assists against the Hawks were his fewest in eight games, and his second-lowest total in December. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "They have them, especially after big games. [A Rookie] thinks that things will be the same the next night, but it's a different opponent, different city, and a different flow to the game. He just couldn't get the same rhythm tonight."

 NOTABLE:  The 33-point margin of victory was the largest for the Hawks this season...Korver extended his streak of at least one 3-point basket, to 96 straight games, drilling his first attempt at 7:40 of the first quarter...Marvin Williams' back-to-back 3s came 20 seconds apart in the first quarter. They would be his only field goals of the game...Atlanta dished out 32 assists, it's their NBA-leading sixth game with 30-plus helpers and 25th time in 27 games they had at least 25...Lou Williams hit six 3-point field goals for the second time in four games...Utah shot only 26.1 percent in the first quarter (6-for-23), tying Atlanta's opponent season-low. The Jazz's 37.2 percent shooting for the game was a Hawks season low... DeMarre Carroll  made a career-high four steals...Atlanta is now 5-1 at home against the Western Conference. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Hawks, Monday @ Miami, Thursday @ Cleveland, Saturday vs. Charlotte. For the Jazz, Saturday @ Charlotte, Monday @ Memphis, Friday vs. Los Angeles Lakers
