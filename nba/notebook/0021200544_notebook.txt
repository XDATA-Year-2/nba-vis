 THE FACTS: Jrue Holiday  scored 30 points,  Thaddeus Young  contributed a double-double consisting of 18 points and 12 rebounds and the Philadelphia 76ers snapped a frustrating five-game losing streak with a 107-100 victory over the Houston Rockets on Saturday night at the Wells Fargo Center.  Jason Richardson  scored 16 points,  Evan Turner  had 12 points and  Spencer Hawes  10 for the Sixers, who improved to 16-22. 
 
 James Harden  led the Rockets with 29 points while  Chandler Parsons  had 23 points.  Carlos Delfino  scored 16 points off the bench and  Omer Asik  added 16 points and 10 rebounds, but the Rockets dropped their third in a row to fall to 21-17. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We've been given a great opportunity to be at home and that's what we've got to do." 
 --  Evan Turner , on beginning a stretch of 12 of 13 at home with a victory 
 
 THE STAT:  The Sixers won despite trailing by as many as 11 points in the first quarter. They are now 4-19 in games when they've trailed by double digits this season. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  After the Rockets got within 96-93, the Sixers reeled off a 6-0 run, including four points by Young to help seal the victory. Parsons missed a couple of 3-pointers and Houston misfired on eight straight attempts between 6:13 and 48.9 of the fourth. 
 
 HOT:  Young was 8-for-14 while Turner was 6-for-10. 
 
 NOT: Jeremy Lin  struggled mightily and missed 11 of his 13 shots. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We played with a lot of energy and emotion." 
 -- Thaddeus Young, on what the team needed in order to snap a five-game skid. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Holiday had 30 points, nine assists, four steals, three rebounds and one blocked shot. For the Rockets, Harden had 29 points, nine rebounds, six assists and two steals. Both guards had terrific all-around games for their respective teams. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  It was quite a lively crowd of 17,329 for this matchup against the Rockets. When the game was close down the stretch, there was a major buzz inside the arena. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "You can't just give possessions away." 
 -- Rockets coach  Kevin McHale , on his team committing 17 turnovers. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Holiday had a stellar night and was able to be even more effective with Turner handling the ball for long stretches. That allowed Holiday to roam free and conserve his energy when the Sixers needed him the most in the waning minutes. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Rockets could have looked into the low post more often for Asik. He was playing at a very high level, knocked down six of his seven shots and even hit all four of his free throws.  
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Rockets center  Donatas Motiejunas  was a DNP-CD. For the Sixers, forward  Arnett Moultrie  and guard  Maalik Wayns  each received a DNP-CD. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Holiday reached the 30-point plateau for the second time this season. Over the past 11 games, Holiday is averaging 20.0 points, 8.6 assists and 4.6 rebounds. ... Harden has hit the 20-point mark for the 20th consecutive game. ... Young picked up his 10th double-double after recording just one all of last season. ... The Sixers are 15-0 when leading at the start of the fourth quarter. ... The Rockets lost their third straight after winning five in a row. ... The Sixers had 24 fast-break points, their highest total since scoring 24 against Milwaukee on Nov. 12. ... The Rockets were 8-for-32 from beyond the arc. ... Parsons was responsible for six of Houston's 16 turnovers.
