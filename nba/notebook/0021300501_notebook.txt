 THE FACT:  The Golden State Warriors won their ninth straight game, beating the Washington Wizards 112-96.  
 
 THE LEAD: Klay Thompson  scored 26 points,  David Lee  had 21 points and 11 rebounds to lead the Warriors (23-13) to a 112-96 win over the Wizards (14-17).  
 Golden State outscored the Wizards 30-5 to begin the third quarter. 
 Washington, which was led by Nene and John Wall with 14, has lost three in a row.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It means something because it's history." --  Warriors coach  Mark Jackson  on the team's winning streak  
 
 
 THE STAT:  Golden State's winning streak is its longest single-season streak since it won 10 straight from Dec. 6-Dec. 23, 1975. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  When Lee hit a turnaround jumper with 2:56 left in the third quarter, it capped off the 30-5 run. "Awful," Wizards coach Randy Wittman said.  
 
 QUOTABLE II : "He said we were lackadaisical. We were still asleep. We played a first half, and in the second half, it looked like our dog died or something."  --  Washington's  Bradley Beal  on what Wittman told the team during the 30-5 Warriors third quarter run 
 
 
 HOT:  Golden State's  Andrew Bogut  was 7-for-9 from the floor and had an alley-oop dunk off  Stephen Curry's  pass off the backboard. 
 
 NOT:  Beal hit four of his first six shots in the first quarter. He then missed his final nine to finish 4-for-15. 
 
 GOOD MOVE :  After the Wizards played the Warriors even in the first half, Golden State played extremely hard and made Washington look amateurish in the first 10 minutes of the third quarter. 
 
 BAD MOVE : The Wizards again had an awful start to a second half.  
 "Until we can learn to play through missed shots and not zap your own energy and the energy of your teammates, we're going to play like that. We're too much right now a team of frontrunners. If things are going good, our energy level is really high and when we don't make shots, the energy just zaps from our bodies," Wittman said.  
 
 NOTABLE:  Golden State forward  Draymond Green  sprained his left ankle.  
 
 IN THE ARENA:  Washington has lost six of its last seven at home, and were booed heartily by the crowd. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Warriors: Tuesday @ Milwaukee, Wednesday @ Brooklyn, Friday vs. Boston. For the Wizards: Tuesday @ Charlotte, Wednesday @ New Orleans, Friday @ Indiana.
