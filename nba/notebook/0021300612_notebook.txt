 THE FACT:  Atlanta scored a season-high 71 first-half points on a season-best 58.1 percent shooting to snap seven-game series-home losing streak to Miami. 
 
 THE LEAD:  The Atlanta Hawks felt they let Miami off the hook the last time they played in Miami. On Monday night, in front of a sellout crowd of 19,262 at Philips Arena, they finished the job.  Paul Millsap  scored 26 points and  DeMarre Carroll  added 19 to lead seven Hawks in double figures, as Atlanta (21-19) beat Miami in a 121-114 shootout. The win was Atlanta's eighth in its last nine home games and snapped a nine-game losing streak and seven-game home skid to Miami (29-12).  
 
 LeBron James  scored a game-high 30 to lead the Heat, who finished a six-game, 11-day road trip at 2-4.  Chris Bosh  added 21 and seven rebounds. Both teams shot the lights out in the first half, with Atlanta taking a 71-70 lead into halftime. The Hawks' 71 points were a season-high, as well as the most points allowed in a half by the Heat. Their 58.1 percent shooting also was a season-best for a first half. Miami hung tough, shooting 64.7 percent from 3-point range, and scoring its season-high for a half. The Heat, who trailed by as much as 12 in the first half, took the lead with on a James 3-pointer with 6:25 to play, but the Heat missed their next five shots and shot 2-for-8 with three turnovers the rest of the way, as Atlanta regained the lead and held on.  
 
 THE STAT:  48-34: Atlanta outscored Miami, 48-34, in the paint, while shooting 51.9 percent for the game. The PIPs are a reversal of the last time the teams met, a 121-119 overtime win for Miami, when they outscored the Hawks, 56-50 in the lane. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  LeBron James did what LeBron James does with the game on the line in the fourth quarter. He nailed back-to-back 3-pointers to turn a 104-101 deficit into a 107-104 lead. But with the large Miami contingent in Philips roaring, in celebration of the Heat's largest lead of the game, the Hawks went on a 10-1 run over the next 3:25 to take a 114-108 lead. The Heat went 0-for-5 with a turnover in the run. 
 
 QUOTABLE : " There just wasn't a lot of pride on that side of the court. Not tonight."  --  Miami head  c oach  Erik Spoelstra  on his team's defense 
 
 
 HOT: Ray Allen  was didn't know he was going to make his second straight start for  Dwyane Wade  until just before tip-off, but he was ready. Allen canned all four of his first-half 3-point attempts and all five of his first-half shots. Allen finished 5-for-5, 4-for-4 from downtown. The four 3's matched his season-high (done twice previously). Allen had four 3-pointers in the his previous nine games ? on 34 attempts...."Both Teams for 3eeeeeeee!": Downtown Atlanta took on new meaning in the first half, as the teams shot a combined 56 percent from 3-point range in the first quarter, both shooting identical 5-for-9. Miami's  Shane Battier  nailed his first three 3-point attempts. The Heat stayed hot through the half, making 11-for-17, 64.7 percent.  
 
 NOT:  "NOBODY For Threeeee": The Heat and Hawks were as cold from behind the arc in the third quarter as they'd been hot in the first half. The teams combined to shoot 1-for-11 in the quarter, with only Atlanta guard  Lou Williams  making a shot from behind the arc....Atlanta Hawk point guard  Jeff Teague , who'd come in averaging 17.5 points per game in two games against Miami, scored two points on 1-for-7 shooting. The mitigating factor was he handed out six assists vs. one turnover. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH: Pero Antic  scored a career-high 17 points with a career-best seven FGMs, grabbed six rebounds and was big over the final 8:23 of the game while playing with five fouls. Antic scored 12 of Atlanta's first 15 points on a pair of 3-point baskets and a turnaround jumper and a dunk, all within the first 5:05. He went 4-for-4, 2-for-2 from 3-point range. His playing time was significantly reduced in the second half, due to his picking up his fourth and fifth fouls 1:14 into the third quarter, but he finished the game and had two points and a rebound in the Hawks' decisive run. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "I was almost too open. It was one of those where you're so open and it's the end of the game, you better make it."  --  Atlanta guard  Kyle Korver  on his dagger 3-pointer with 55.1 seconds left that gave the Hawks a 119-114 lead 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  LeBron shot a sizzling 6-for-10 in the second half (2-for-5 from 3)...Millsap scored 20 of his 26 points in the first-half, marking only the second time in his career that he scored 20 points in the first half...The 70 points Atlanta allowed in the first half eclipsed their previous season-high of 65, scored by Brooklyn in Thursday's game in London... Atlanta chalked up 33 assists. It was their 22nd consecutive game with 20 assists and eighth this season with at least 30... Norris Cole  led the Heat with eight assists, doubling his output over his previous two games...Korver extended his streak of one 3-point basket to 109 straight games, drilling a trey 15 seconds into the second quarter...Korver's six assists matched his season high... Shelvin Mack  led Atlanta with seven assists, giving him 14 in his last two games against only three turnovers...All five Heat starters scored in double figures...Miami's bench was outscored 54-21.
