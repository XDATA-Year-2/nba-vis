  Knicks-Grizzlies notebook   By Phil Stukenborg, for NBA.com Posted Thursday March 10, 2011 12:14AM THE FACTS:   Carmelo Anthony  drained a 19-foot jump shot from the left wing with 0.5 seconds left to lift the New York Knicks to a victory over the Memphis Grizzlies. Anthony led the Knicks with 31 points and  Amare Stoudemire  added 26 to prevent a comeback attempt by the Grizzlies, who overcame a 17-point second-half deficit to tie the game at 108 with 14.2 seconds to go.  Tony Allen  led Memphis with 22 and  Darrell Arthur  scored 21. Final score: Knicks 110, Grizzlies 108 in front of 17,512 Wednesday at FedExForum. QUOTABLE:  "It was supposed to be a pick-and-roll but they overplayed it and I got open and away from (Grizzlies defender) Tony (Allen) a little bit. He had been guarding me so close the whole night. I just pulled up and the shot went in. It feels good. It just goes to show we can win games in close situations."   --  Anthony on his game-winning shot with 0.5 seconds left. THE STAT:  The Knicks were limited to franchise-record low four free throw attempts in 48 minutes, but overcame the deficiency by making 12-of-24 3-pointers.  Toney Douglas , starting for the fifth straight game in place of injured point guard  Chauncey Billups , was 4-of-8 and Anthony was 3-of-5. Memphis outscored the Knicks, 33-4, from the free throw line, but made only three 3-point baskets. TURNING POINT:  Memphis rallied from 17 points down in the second half to trim the deficit to 108-105 following an Arthur slam with 1:26 to go. But the Grizzlies turned the ball over on each of their next two possessions, denying Memphis an opportunity to potentially take the lead. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Anthony and Stoudemire have put together solid back-to-back performances. Anthony had 34 in Monday's 131-109 victory over Utah and followed with his 31-point effort against the Grizzlies. Stoudemire had 31 against Utah and 26 against Memphis. GOOD MOVE:  Knicks coach  Mike D'Antoni  elected to not call timeout after Grizzlies forward  Zach Randolph's  free throw with 14.2 seconds left completed a three-point play and tied the game at 108. D'Antoni didn't want to give the Grizzlies the chance to put their best defenders on the floor and he said he likely would have had Anthony take the final shot anyway. HOT:  Randolph finished with 20 points and 11 rebounds, giving him 200 games in his career with at least 20 points and 11 rebounds. NOTABLE:  In its victory over Utah Monday, the Knicks had 32 assists. In Wednesday's win over the Grizzlies, the Knicks had 31 assists on 47 made baskets. Douglas led the Knicks with 10 assists, while Anthony and  Landry Fields  added six apiece. Douglas recorded his second career double-double. UP NEXT:  For the Grizzlies, Saturday @ Miami, Monday vs. Los Angeles Clippers, March 17 @ New York. For the Knicks, Thursday @ Dallas, Sunday vs. Indiana, Tuesday @ Indiana.
