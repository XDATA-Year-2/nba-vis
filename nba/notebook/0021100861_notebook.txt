  Notebook: Knicks 111, Bucks 107 Posted Thursday April 12, 2012 12:33AM By Rick Braun, for NBA.com THE FACTS:   J.R. Smith  swished a go-ahead 3-pointer with 1:04 left, and  Carmelo Anthony  scored 32 points and grabbed 10 rebounds as the New York Knicks rallied for a 111-107 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks Wednesday night at the Bradley Center, strongly boosting their playoff hopes. Smith scored eight of his 14 points in the fourth quarter as the Knicks took a two-game lead over Milwaukee for the eighth and final playoff spot with eight games to play. Monta Ellis  scored 35 points and had 10 assists for the Bucks,  Brandon Jennings  added 22 and  Mike Dunleavy  had 19. But the Bucks wilted down the stretch after leading, 94-86, with 9:23 left. With the Knicks trailing, 107-105, Smith and Anthony played a pick-and-roll off the left wing. When Ellis stepped beneath the pick, Smith let fly with the 3-pointer that gave the Knicks the lead for good. QUOTABLE:  "It was just a regular shot. They went under the screen and pretty much doubled 'Melo' and I was wide open. Those are the shots that we need myself and my teammates to make, and fortunately it went in."   -- Smith on his go-ahead 3-pointer. THE STAT:  After Anthony opened the night with a jump shot, the Knicks' next 14 field goals came on either layups or dunks as the Milwaukee defense was non-existent. After making 17 first-quarter field goals, the Knicks needed 27 and 1/2 minutes to get their next 17 field goals. TURNING POINT:  The Bucks were ahead, 94-86, with 8:53 left when a frustrated Anthony was hit with a technical foul. But Jennings missed the free throw, and a dunk by  Tyson Chandler  and a 3-point play by Anthony started a 10-2 run that tied it at 96.  Steve Novak , who grew up in nearby Brown Deer and played at Marquette, capped the run with a 3-pointer, and the Knicks outplayed the Bucks down the stretch. QUOTABLE II:  "This was probably the biggest win that we've had thus far in the season just for how important it was, on the road, the way we gutted it out, the way we responded being down eight down the stretch and the way we buckled down on the defensive end and won this game."   -- Anthony HOT:  Ellis made 14 of 25 shots, but his percentage paled to Chandler's 6-for-6 night. Chandler leads the league in field goal percentage at 67.8 percent (217 for 320). NOT:  Dunleavy was an uncharacteristic 5 for 15, including 0 for 6 in the fourth quarter. He entered the game shooting 48.7 percent. GOOD MOVE:  Bucks coach  Scott Skiles  inserted second-year man  Larry Sanders  into the game at the start of the second quarter after the Knicks made 17 of 22 first-quarter shots, including 14 layups or dunks. Sanders started defending the bucket and had two of his three blocks in the second quarter as the Bucks pulled to a 62-62 tie at the half after trailing by as many as 14 in the first quarter. BAD MOVE:  When Ellis went beneath Anthony's pick, Smith was wide open for his go-ahead 3-pointer. ROOKIE WATCH:  Guard  Iman Shumpert  played a game-high 42 minutes and had 16 points, six rebounds, five assists and three steals. NOTABLE:  Point guard  Baron Davis  played just 19 minutes and said it was because of the hard fall he took a night earlier in the loss at Chicago. ...  Drew Gooden  started at center for the Bucks but only played the first 5:02 and took a seat for the night. He'd missed two games last week with a bad back. ... Chandler finished with a double-double of 19 points and 11 rebounds. ... The Bucks now trail the Knicks by two games and the 76ers by three games as they're on the outside looking in at the playoff picture. Because they and the Knicks split the season series, 2-2, the next tiebreaker will be conference records. The Knicks are 23-18 and the Bucks are 21-19 in conference play. ... UP NEXT:  For the Knicks, Friday vs. Washington, Sunday vs. Miami, Tuesday vs. Boston. For the Bucks, Friday @ Detroit, Saturday vs. Indiana, Wednesday @ Washington.
