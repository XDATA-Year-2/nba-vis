 THE FACT: The Phoenix Suns snapped the Portland Trail Blazers' 11-game win streak. 
 THE LEAD: The Phoenix Suns (8-7), once again playing without  Eric Bledsoe  and seemingly buried with a 16-point early deficit, came back to roll over the Blazers (13-3) for the second time in a month, 120-106 (the Suns' season-high for scoring) Wednesday night. 
 
 Goran Dragic  had 31 points and 10 assists for the Suns, while  Channing Frye  had a season-high 25 points and nine boards. The Morris twins combined for 34 points off the bench;  Markieff Morris  had 19 points while  Marcus  added 15. 
 For the Blazers,  LaMarcus Aldridge  had 24 points, while  Damian Lillard  had 16 points. 
 The Suns whipped the Blazers on opening night in Phoenix, and had not the Suns' Markieff Morris missed an uncontested follow shot just before the final buzzer at Portland Nov. 13, the Suns would be 3-0 against the NBA's No. 3 team. The Suns also downed the Blazers in an exhibition game in Portland. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I'm glad we don't have to play Phoenix until April. After we got a lead, they completely outplayed us; hats off to them. Playing hard is a talent. It's underrated as a talent."  
 
 --Blazers coach  Terry Stotts 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Suns turned it over only 10 times while getting good shots.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  When Dragic began forcing a fast pace and Frye began hitting outside shots early in the second quarter. The Blazers led 39-23 when Dragic converted a three-point play on a 14-foot bank shot, then -- moments later -- Frye and Dragic nailed 3-pointers. The Suns kept the pace fast and went on a 38-17 run to take a 61-56 lead just before halftime. Frye and Dragic each hit 3-pointers to fuel a 10-0 run to start the second half. That gave the Suns a 71-58 lead; they never were seriously threatened. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "That's typical of coming off a road trip."  
 
 --  Jeff Hornacek 
 
 
 HOT:  Frye shot 10-for-12.  
 
 NOT : Bledsoe missed his sixth straight game with a bruised shin, an injury that was thought to be minor at first. An MRI showed no structural damage. The Suns are 3-3 without him, including wins in three of the past four. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  The Suns'  Archie Goodwin  had three points in 3:42. The Suns'  Dionte Christmas  had zero points in 6:54. The Blazers'  Allen Crabbe  had four points, one rebound and one assist in 5:13. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Frye, who got off to a terrible start this season, is on a tear. Over the past four games, he's averaged 18.8 games while shooting 28-for-49 (57 percent) including 14-for-29 (48 percent) on 3-pointers. Frye missed last season with heart problems. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:   "I'm becoming comfortable with all aspects of the game. I'm getting my rhythm. My teammates are finding me. And the shots are going in."  
 
 --Channing Frye 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Blazers' franchise record for 3-point shooting in a season is 38.3 percent. So far this season, they're shooting 41.5 percent from long range, including Wednesday night. Stotts says five players -- all capable of making them -- are taking the shots, so, "Is 42 percent sustainable? I think it is." ... Stotts also noted, "The 3-point shot is being valued more and more," in part because of the use of analytics. "Analytics is being included [in teams' thinking] more and more. It's hard to ignore."  ... The Suns kept the Blazers' 3-point game within reason (7-for-19 for 37 percent).  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Trail Blazers, Sunday @ Los Angeles Lakers, Monday vs. Pacers, Wednesday vs. Thunder. For the Suns, Friday @ Utah, Saturday vs. Jazz and Tuesday @ Memphis.
