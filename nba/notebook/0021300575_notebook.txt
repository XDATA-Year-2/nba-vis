 THE FACT:   LaMarcus Aldridge 's 3-pointer, which put Portland ahead 94-93 with 3:18 remaining, was his first in seven attempts this season. For his career, Aldridge is 22-for-108 from beyond the arc. 
 
 THE LEAD:  The Trail Blazers closed out the game on a 12-0 run to break a 96-96 tie and pull out a 108-96 victory over Cleveland Wednesday night at the Moda Center. 
 Aldridge scored 32 points -- including nine straight at the front end of the winning run -- and grabbed 18 rebounds for the Blazers (29-9), who also got 28 points, six rebounds and five assists from  Damian Lillard . 
 
 Luol Deng  scored 25 points and guard  Kyrie Irving  added 21 for the Cavaliers (14-25), playing the second of back-to-back games after a 120-118 win over the Los Angeles Lakers Tuesday night.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "At shootaround today, I told him to stop shooting 3's, because he'd never shoot them in a game. And he just happened to make that one." 
 -- Damian Lillard on Aldridge's big 3-pointer 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Over the final 2:31, Portland was 4-for-4 from the field, finishing with back-to-back 3s from  Wesley Matthews  and Lillard. Cleveland was 0-for-6. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Aldridge's big trey -- with the shot clock moving toward zero -- kicked off the Blazers' game-winning late tear. 
 
 HOT:  The Blazers made 12-for-21 shots in the fourth quarter, including their final five in a row. 
 
 NOT:  The Cavaliers were 9-for-26 over the last 12 minutes. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "He hit some tough shots down the stretch, came up with some tough rebounds for kick-out 3's. It discombobulated us a little bit. Then we missed some shots, and there was the ballgame."   
 -- Cleveland coach  Mike Brown  on Aldridge 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  With Irving shadowing a hot Lillard in the third quarter, Lillard rubbed Irving off a screen, took a lob pass from  Nicolas Batum  at the rim and flushed it to draw Portland even at 67-67 in the third quarter. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "We're playing four teams that are in the playoffs right now. Right now, it's San Antonio. You can't look at the whole thing. If you're going to read a 2,000-page book, you can't look at the whole book. You have to read the first chapter."  
 -- Portland coach  Terry Stotts  on the Blazers' upcoming four-game, five-day road trip 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Aldridge had his 22nd double-double and his 16th game with at least 20 points and 10 rebounds. ... Lillard, who was 5-for-10 from 3-point range, has made at least four 3s an NBA-high 17 times this season. ... Deng has averaged 18.5 points in his four games with Cleveland since being acquired in a trade with Chicago.  
 
 NEXT:  For the Cavaliers, Monday vs. Houston, Wednesday vs. Toronto, Friday vs. L.A. Lakers. For the Trail Blazers, Friday @ San Antonio, Saturday @ Dallas, Monday @ Houston.
