 THE FACTS: David Lee  scored 29 points and added 11 rebounds as the Golden State Warriors ended a four-game losing streak with a 125-118 victory against the Toronto Raptors on Monday. 
 
 Stephen Curry , in his first game at home since putting up 54 at Madison Square Garden last week, had 26 points and 12 assists to help the Warriors (34-27) kick off their season-ending run of 16 home games in the final 22 contests with a critical win. With Utah losing to Milwaukee, Golden State moved 1 1/2 games clear of eighth place in the Western Conference. 
 
 Andrea Bargnani  and  Rudy Gay  led the Raptors (23-38) with 26 points each, but combined for only six in the fourth quarter, when Toronto's shooting percentage cratered to 27.6 percent and a seven-point lead after three quarters melted away. 
 
 Klay Thompson  had 10 of his 22 points in the final period, when the Warriors outscored the Raptors 42-28. Golden State finished with a season high in shooting percentage (57.3 percent) and 33 assists. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "There was a sense of desperation, and there needed to be, because if we lose this game tonight, it's a big hit to us. We should have won that Philly game [a 104-97 loss on Saturday where the Warriors blew an 11-point third-quarter lead]. We found a way to win this one." 
 -- David Lee 
 
 THE STAT : The game continued a strange trend for Bargnani and the Raptors; Toronto is now 0-10 this season in games where the former No. 1 overall pick scores 19 or more points. Of course, Bargnani's non-existent defense on his opposite number might have something to do with it. Lee struggled during the Warriors' recent 1-4 road trip, but posted his fifth 25-point, 10-rebound game of the season on Monday, going 12-for-21 from the floor while doing it. 
 
 TURNING POINT : As the Raptors gave Warriors rookie  Harrison Barnes  acres of space as an invitation to shoot, Barnes went ahead and did so at the 5:40 mark, draining a 3-pointer that put the Warriors ahead for good at 103-100. 
 
 GOOD MOVE : It may have been forced on him by Thompson's foul trouble, but Warriors coach  Mark Jackson 's faith in Barnes -- who came into Monday shooting 33.3 percent from the floor after the All-Star break -- paid off in the fourth quarter. In addition to the go-ahead 3-pointer, Barnes delivered the coup de grace with 1:07 left, driving past Gay for a layup and three-point play. The Warriors led 114-105, and Toronto couldn't get closer than four points during a seemingly endless final minute distended by seven Raptors fouls. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "They overplayed  [Jarrett Jack ] and Steph, and I told Harrison that I want him to look for Steph, but I want to make sure his guy defends him. I wanted him to attack if he felt like they fell asleep." 
 -- Mark Jackson 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT : Warriors center  Andrew Bogut  came back after missing six games with back spasms and collected eight rebounds with four points. 
 
 HOT : Sure, plenty of it was down the stretch in the fourth quarter when the Warriors were defending 3-pointers and happy to give up putbacks, but reserve Toronto big man  Amir Johnson  finished 10-for-10 from the floor en route to a 23-point, 15-rebound night. 
 
 NOT : Bargnani was working on one of his best games of the season, with 26 points through three quarters. Then he promptly went ice cold in the fourth quarter, missing all five shot attempts. 
 
 NOTABLE : Gay returned from a one-game absence due to back spasms, but his point total was offset to some extent by six turnovers. . . . Bargnani played despite feeling ill at the Raptors' shootaround and delivered his first 20-point game since Dec. 7 at Utah. He also tied his career-high with five made 3-pointers. . . .  Kyle Lowry  had his second consecutive game with at least 10 rebounds and nearly had another triple-double, falling shy by one assist. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Raptors, Wednesday @ Phoenix, Friday @ Lakers, Sunday vs. Cleveland. For the Warriors, Wednesday vs. Sacramento, Friday vs. Houston, Saturday vs. Milwaukee.
