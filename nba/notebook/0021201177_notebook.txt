 THE FACTS:  Jrue Holiday  scored 22 points,  Thaddeus Young  had 18 points and 13 rebounds, and the Philadelphia 76ers ended a three-game losing streak with a 97-86 win over the Washington Wizards on Friday night. 
 
 Spencer Hawes  and  Damien Wilkins  each scored 15 points for the 76ers (32-47), who had lost four of five games. Hawes scored seven points during a 12-0 third quarter for a 67-59 lead. Philadelphia maintained no less than a six-point cushion from there and Holiday's layup gave the visitors their largest lead at 92-78. 
 
 John Wall  scored 24 points for the Wizards (29-51), who held a 13-point lead in the first quarter, but wound losing up their fourth straight game. Washington committed 17 turnovers and finished 1-for-13 on its 3-point attempts. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "Let's move forward to the basketball game. We have four more games to play. I've told you all along I'm not the topic of conversation. We're going to focus on the games and play those. We'll sit down at the beginning of the season as we've always done. I've got a wonderful season with [76ers owner]  Josh Harris  and we will discuss what we need to do next year." 
 -- 76ers coach  Doug Collins  to reporters before the game asking about conflicting media reports regarding his job security for next season 
 
 THE STAT : In his previous two games, Holiday had only one assist in each. The All-Star guard found his distributing form with seven assists, four coming in the third quarter when the 76ers outscored the Wizards 26-16. Philadelphia finished with 29 assists 
 
 QUOTABLE II :  "It's disappointing. It was our goal after the All-Star break. We came so close. We were playing so well. But we've got two games left, and we can have something to build on for next season." 
 -- Wizards forward  Trevor Booker  on the Wizards falling short of a ninth place goal set after starting the season with a 4-28 record 
 
 HOT : Young knocked down 8 of his 9 shots from field including all four after halftime. 
 
 NOT : 76ers forward  Evan Turner  dished out seven assists, but played a scoreless 24 minutes and missed all 11 of his field goal attempts. . 
 
 QUOTABLE III :  "I think whether it's a conscious thing or a subconscious thing, when you officially get eliminated, it kind of hits you. It takes some of the wind out of your sails, but then you regroup and refocus and try to take out of it whatever you can the last however-many games." 
 -- 76ers center Spencer Hawes on the 76ers scuffling during their previous two games after having been eliminated from the Eastern Conference playoff race 
 
 NOTABLE:  Dorell Wright  scored 13 points for the 76ers. ... Kevin Seraphin  also had 10 for the Wizards. ...Washington needs one victory to reach 30 for the first time since the 2007-08 season. ...The Wizards played without forwards  Martell Webster  (abdominal strain) and  Trevor Ariza  (sore left knee). ...76ers guard  Nick Young  played a scoreless eight minutes in his first game back at the Verizon Center after being traded by the Wizards midway through the 2011-12 season. Young spent 4 1/2 seasons in Washington after being selected in the first round of the 2007 draft. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the 76ers, Sunday vs. Cavaliers, Monday @ Pistons, Wednesday @ Pacers. For the Wizards, Monday @ Nets, Wednesday @ Bulls.
