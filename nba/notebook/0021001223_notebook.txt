  Hornets-Mavericks notebook   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday April 13, 2011 11:35PM THE FACTS:  Just in time for the postseason, the Mavericks proved they can beat a playoff team after all.  Dirk Nowitzki  scored 32 points Wednesday in a 121-89 rout of New Orleans, snapping Dallas' streak of nine consecutive losses to Western Conference playoff teams. Six other players scored in double digits for the Mavs (57-25), who had not celebrated a win against the West's other seven playoff qualifiers since a 109-100 defeat of the Lakers back on Jan. 19. The Mavericks shot 80 percent (12-for-15) in the fourth quarter and outscored the visiting Hornets 63-28 in the second half to run away with their fourth straight victory.  Jarrett Jack  scored 22 points off the bench to lead New Orleans (46-36), which suffered its third straight setback and its most lopsided loss of the season. QUOTABLE:  "Everything was a little too easy for them in the first half and we talked at halftime how we had to step it up and bring a little more energy and really contest shots. We got into them a little more and made it tougher. We were really rotating well."   -- Nowitzki following his 12th 30-point game of the season. THE STAT:  Mavericks forward  Shawn Marion  recorded his 1,500th career steal when he intercepted a pass by Chris Paul with 4:09 remaining in the first quarter. Reaching that milestone also put him into some elite company as just the fifth player with at least 1,500 points and 1,000 blocked shots (1,086) since the NBA began tracking both stats in 1973-74. The others are  Hakeem Olajuwon ,  Karl Malone ,  Kevin Garnett  and  Julius Erving . TURNING POINT:  Nowitzki nearly outscored the Hornets by himself in the third quarter. He scored 12 as Dallas won the quarter, 28-13, and flipped a 61-58 halftime deficit into an 86-74 advantage to start the fourth quarter. QUOTABLE II:  "We're in this position because we've done some things well and we can't lose sight of that. I think it's easy for us to look at the negative, and I do that enough. Coaching makes you emotionally negative, but I'm going to try to focus on the things that we've done to get here and try to make the most of this opportunity."   -- Hornets head coach  Monty Williams HOT:  Dallas point guard Jason Kidd was 4-for-6 from 3-point distance and finished with 12 points, eight assists, four steals, three rebounds and just one turnover. Backcourt partner  J.J. Barea  reached twin figures for the eighth time in his last nine games with 14 points, eight assists and five rebounds. NOT:  The Hornets shot 28.2 percent (11-for-39) from the field in the second half, including 1-for-6 from behind the arc. ... New Orleans was outscored by a combined 66 points during its three-game slide to end the regular season. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Paul finished with seven points (2-for-9 shooting), eight assists and three turnovers. In his past four games, he has averaged just 7.3 points on 30.6 percent shooting (11-for-36). INSIDE THE ARENA:  This was the 399th consecutive regular-season sellout at the American Airlines Center, the longest active streak in the NBA. BAD MOVE:  Mavericks guard  Rodrigue Beaubois  sprained his left foot in a second-quarter collision with a New Orleans player and did not return. X-rays showed no structural damage, but it's a concern since this is the same foot he injured last summer. Beaubois broke the fifth metatarsal bone while practicing with the French national team and missed the first 54 games of the season. He started 26 games and averaged 8.4 points and 2.3 assists. ROOKIE WATCH:  Hornets guard  Quincy Pondexter  reached double figures for the fourth time this season with 10 points and four rebounds. NOTABLE:  Dallas forward  Peja Stojakovic  was not at the game due to undisclosed personal reasons, but is expected to rejoin the team for the start of the playoffs. ... The Hornets and Mavericks split the season series, 2-2. The first three games were decided by a total of six points. ... Sixth man  Jason Terry  was the only Maverick to appear in all 82 games this season. ... Dallas finished 13-1 this season when scoring 110-plus points and 16-1 with six or more players scoring in double figures. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Game 1 of the playoffs against the Trail Blazers on Saturday in Dallas. For the Hornets, Game 1 against the Lakers in Los Angeles on Sunday.
