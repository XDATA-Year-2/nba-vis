 THE FACT: Monta Ellis  (37 points) and  Dirk Nowitzki  (35) became the first Dallas Mavericks teammates to score 35 points in the same game since  Jamal Mashburn  (42) and  Jason Kidd  (38) did it on April 11, 1995, also against the Rockets. 
 
 THE LEAD : Led by season-high point totals from Ellis and Nowitzki, Dallas rallied from an 18-point deficit to knock off the Houston Rockets 123-120 in a thrilling finish Wednesday night at the American Airlines Center.  
 
 Shawn Marion  pulled the Mavericks (8-4) to within one with a dunk with 1:20 left in the fourth quarter, and gave the club its first lead since the opening seconds of the game with a corner 3 with just 47 seconds remaining.  James Harden  drew contact on a drive to the basket on the ensuing possession with nine seconds left on the clock, but could only go 1-for-2 at the line.  Jose Calderon  added two free throws, and a last-second 3-point attempt by  Patrick Beverley  was poked away by Ellis to seal the victory for the Mavericks. 
 Defense proved to be at a premium all night, as both clubs shot better than 55 percent from the field and 38 percent from 3-point distance. Dallas' stoppers turned it on when it mattered most, holding Houston (8-5) to just 19 points in the final frame to cap off the comeback. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We cut it to three and then they went on a run and got it back up over 10. It would have been easy to drop our heads and stop playing, but these guys aren't going to do that." 
 --Mavericks coach  Rick Carlisle 
 
 
 THE STAT:  With 35 points, Nowitzki passed  Reggie Miller  (25,279) to move into 15th place on the NBA's all-time scoring list. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Nowitzki totaled 14 of his 35 points in the fourth quarter, including three straight mid-range jumpers to open the period, sparking a 14-3 run to bring the Mavericks to within three midway through the period. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We never could get a handle on them. All game long they were scoring. We were scoring too. We had a lead in the fourth quarter again ... We just couldn't get them stopped the whole game. Dirk [Nowitzki] and [Monta] Ellis got what they wanted." 
 --Rockets coach  Kevin McHale 
 
 
 HOT:  The Rockets hit its first eight shots from the field, including four from beyond the arc, to jump out to a 21-12 lead early in the first quarter. Houston finished the frame with a 40-29 advantage, marking the first time in franchise history it has scored 40 points in the first quarter in back-to-back games. ...  Dwight Howard, James Harden, Chandler Parsons  and  Terrence Jones  shot a combined 21-for-26 in the first half.  
 
 NOT:   Omer Asik, Jeremy Lin  and  Francisco Garcia  combined for five points on 1-for-9 shooting coming off the bench. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "We stayed together as a team. We got the defensive stops when we needed and came down and made shots on the other end." 
 --Monta Ellis 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT : Howard hit his first 11 shots from the field, connected on 9-for-13 attempts at the free-throw line and finished with 33 points and 13 rebounds. ... Parsons notched 21 points, 11 assists and four threes while shooting 70 percent from the floor. ... Ellis went 13-for-18 and dished out eight assists to go along with 37 points. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH: Shane Larkin  proved to be the go-to backup to Calderon in just his second game and showed off a steady scoring touch, hitting two 3s and amassing eight points in 16 minutes.  
 
 NOTABLE : Dallas has managed to win its last two games despite being outscored in the paint by 48 points. ... Nowitzki trails  Kevin Garnett  by 42 points for 14th place on the NBA's all-time scoring list. ... The Mavericks equaled their best home start (6-0) since 2007-08. ... Houston shot 64.9 percent from the field in the first three quarters but could only manage to hit 26.3 percent of its shots in the fourth quarter.
