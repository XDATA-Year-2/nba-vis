 THE FACT:  The Washington Wizards lost in their fifth attempt this season to go a game over .500. They have not been over .500 since Oct. 31, 2009.  
 
 THE LEAD: Gerald Wallace 's layup with 2.9 seconds to go gave the Boston Celtics a 113-111 overtime win over the Washington Wizards on Wednesday night.  Jeff Green  had a season-high 39 points, and rookie point guard  Phil Pressey  scored a career-high 20 for Boston. The Celtics had lost 15 of their previous 17. 
 Boston (15-29) never trailed in the first three quarters and lost a 19-point lead before Green's 3-pointer with 1:18 to play forced overtime. 
 Washington (20-21) failed in its fifth try this season to get over .500. The Wizards were led by  John Wall , who had his second career triple-double with 28 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists.  Nene  had 17. 
 
 QUOTABLE:   "A lot of reasons to give up, and they didn't do that." 
 -- Celtics coach  Brad Stevens 
 
 
 THE STAT:   Green eclipsed his previous season high of 31 and was just four points away from his career high of 43.   
 
 TURNING POINT:   Washington guard  Bradley Beal  is medically restricted to 30 minutes per game. Coach  Randy Wittman  didn't play him in overtime, and that could have given Boston the game. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:   That's what our guys think. That's exactly what our guys think. ...That is the problem. I can get mine because who we [are] playing? You cannot screw with the basketball gods like that." 
 -- Randy Wittman on his team believing they were overlooking the injury-ravaged Celtics 
 
 
 HOT:   Green, playing in his hometown, was 14-for-26 from the field, including 8-for-16 on 3-pointers. "I put myself in the position where I had to be the man to carry the team, to shoot the ball, and that's what I did," Green said. 
 
 NOT:  Wall missed 20 of his 29 shots, including all four of his 3-pointers. "We get to playing selfishly and it all starts with me. That's the reason why we lost today," Wall said.  
 
 GOOD MOVE:   Stevens started Pressey and Wallace in the backcourt because Boston was missing three guards:  Avery Bradley ,  Jerryd Bayless  and  Rajon Rondo . 
 
 BAD MOVE:   The Wizards playing listlessly in the first half and allowing the Celtics to lead 61-43 at the halftime. 
 
 NOTABLE:   Wall hadn't had a triple-double since Nov. 10, 2010, the sixth game in his career. That, coincidentally, was the final one of  Yao Ming 's career.   
 
 IN THE ARENA:   Three great former Washington Bullets,  Bob Dandridge ,  Elvin Hayes  and  Bernard King  were in attendance. Dandridge and Hayes were members of the 1977-78 Bullets, the last time this franchise won the NBA title.   
 
 UP NEXT:   For the Celtics: Friday vs. Oklahoma City, Sunday vs. Brooklyn, Monday @ New York. For the Wizards: Friday @ Phoenix, Saturday @ Utah, Monday @ Golden State
