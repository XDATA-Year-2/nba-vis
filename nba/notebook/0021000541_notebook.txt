  Grizzlies-Thunder notebook   By Randy Renner, for NBA.com Posted Sunday January 9, 2011 12:02AM THE FACTS:  Oklahoma City's  Kevin Durant  and  Russell Westbrook , the NBA's highest scoring duo, combined for 62 points as the Thunder beat the Memphis Grizzlies 109-100. Durant, the NBA's leading scorer, pumped in 40 while grabbing eight rebounds and dishing four assists. Westbrook had a double-double with 22 points and 11 assists.  Zach Randolph  had another monster game for the Grizzlies with 27 points and 16 rebounds. QUOTABLE:  "We beat a really good team tonight. They're a matchup problem for everyone in the league."   -- Thunder coach  Scott Brooks THE STAT:  Durant and Westbrook combined to miss only one of their 24 free throws. The entire Memphis team was just 19-for-30 at the line.

QUOTABLE II:  "This was a very physical game. Every possession was critical, good teams take advantage of that and we did tonight."   -- Brooks HOT:  In the third quarter Durant scored 18 points on 5-for-8 shooting. NOT:  In the entire game Memphis shot 6.7 percent (1-for-15) on 3-pointers. Coming into the game the Grizzlies were averaging 35 percent from long range.
