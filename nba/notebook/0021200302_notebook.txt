 THE FACTS: O.J. Mayo  led six Dallas players in double figures with 19 points and the Mavericks played some of their stingiest defense of the season Monday, stifling Sacramento for a long stretch of the first half in a 119-96 victory at the American Airlines Center.  Chris Kaman  added 18 points as Dallas (11-10) notched its third straight win to climb back over .500.  DeMarcus Cousins  and  Francisco Garcia  scored 25 each for the Kings (7-13), who had won three straight. 
 The Mavericks scored 32 points off 20 turnovers, doing much of that damage during a drought that saw the Kings go nearly 11 minutes without a field goal.  Jason Thompson  had a tip-in with 2:26 left in the first quarter and Sacramento didn't get another field goal until Thompson's hook shot with 3:33 remaining in the half. Thompson finished with 11 points and 12 rebounds. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We found toughness. We found grit. We found  Derek Fisher . We've won four out of five with him." 
 
 -- Mavericks head coach  Rick Carlisle  on his starting point guard, who had 11 points, six assists and zero turnovers. 
 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Sacramento dropped its 17th consecutive regular-season game in Dallas, the third-longest active streak in the NBA. The Kings' last road win against the Mavericks was on Feb. 27, 2003. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Mavericks broke open a 29-29 tie with a 29-2 run spanning the first and second quarters. The Kings missed 12 straight shots and committed eight turnovers during that stretch. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I think defensively we need to cover each other's back, especially on the road. We really need to work on that and I think we can fix that." 
 
 -- Kings' Francisco Garcia 
 
 
 
 HOT:  Kaman and Mayo combined for 32 points (16 each) on 13-for-16 shooting in the first half. 
 
 
NOT : Sacramento shot 25 percent (4-for-16) from the field and scored only 14 points in the second quarter.  
 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Cousins could be facing a fine from the league office after delivering a below-the-belt punch to Mayo in the second quarter. 
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Following up his 40-point game Saturday at Houston, Mayo led Dallas in points and rebounds (seven) and added four assists. He was 3-for-4 from 3-point distance. Things were going so well for Mayo that he pulled up for a 3-pointer when the Mavericks had a 4-on-1 fastbreak late in the third quarter -- and swished it. 
 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  Dallas forward  Dirk Nowitzki  received the Naismith Legacy Award at halftime.  Jim Naismith,  grandson of basketball inventor  Dr. James Naismith , presented the award, which honors players, coaches and other individuals or organizations for their role in furthering the values of honor, respect and integrity, on and off the court.  
 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Mavericks forward  Jae Crowder  hit all four of his field-goal attempts in the fourth quarter to reach double figures for the first time since Nov. 24. He added four rebounds, four assists and two steals. ... Kings forward  Thomas Robinson  was 0-for-4 with two turnovers. 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Forward  Shawn Marion  (strained right groin) and guard  Dominique Jones  (illness) did not play for the Mavericks and Kings guard  Tyreke Evans  (sore left knee) missed his third straight game. ... Dallas set a season high for first-half points with 65. ... Dallas is 10-1 when shooting 45 percent or better from the field this season (55.2 percent). ... The Mavericks are 10-1 when holding the lead entering the fourth quarter, including 7-0 at home. ... Garcia set a career high with seven 3-pointers (7-for-12). He twice made six in a game. ... Through the first three quarters, the Kings' reserves were 0-for-11 from the field and were outscored 24-2 by the Dallas bench. ... Dallas is 8-1 when scoring 100-plus. 
 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Wednesday @ Boston, Friday @ Toronto, Saturday @ Minnesota. For the Kings, Wednesday @ Milwaukee, Friday @ Oklahoma City, Sunday vs. Denver.
