  Bulls-Warriors notebook   By Steve R. Waterhouse, for NBA.com Posted Sunday February 6, 2011 2:13AM THE FACTS:  The Golden State Warriors played one of their most stout defensive performances of the season as they held the Chicago Bulls to just 18 fourth-quarter points in a 101-90 victory. The Bulls'  Derrick Rose , who came in averaging 24.6 points per game, was held to 14 points on a 6-for-15 effort. QUOTABLE:  "Defensively, we've been doing some great things, but we haven't been able to put it together for an entire game ... Today I think we did that."   -- Warriors coach  Keith Smart . THE STAT:  This was the 13th 30-point game of the year for  Monta Ellis , who scored a game-high 33 points. TURNING POINT:  The Warriors took control of the game with a 16-3 run to open the fourth quarter that gave them a 89-74 lead with 5:49 left. GOOD MOVE:  The Warriors put pressure on Rose all night with Ellis and a rotating defender and that led to nine turnovers -- a season high for a Warriors opponent. QUOTABLE II:  "I thought our guys followed to a 'T' how we were going to play him [Rose] and we kind of bottled him up a little bit. We couldn't let him get his game going early and that's what he's been doing to a lot of teams. He sets the tone with their team."   -- Keith Smart. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Comedian  Dave Chapelle . NOTABLE:  The Warriors have won three straight -- and have held all three opponents to under 100 points. They have won 10 of their last 14 home games and are 5-0 against Eastern Conference Central teams. UP NEXT:  For the Bulls, Monday @ Blazers, Wednesday @ Jazz, Saturday @ Hornets. For the Warriors, Monday vs. Suns, Wednesday vs. Nuggets, Thursday @ Suns.
