 THE FACT:   Portland heads into Christmas with a 23-5 record, percentage points behind Oklahoma City (22-4) for the best record in the league. 
 
 THE LEAD:   Damian Lillard  scored 13 of his game-high 29 points in the fourth quarter of Portland's 110-107 victory over New Orleans Saturday night at the Moda Center. 
 
 LaMarcus Aldridge  added 18 points and eight rebounds and  Wesley Matthews  had 18 points and six boards for the Trail Blazers, who trailed by as many as 13 points in the first half. 
 
 Anthony Davis  collected 21 points and nine rebounds and  Tyreke Evans  contributed 21 points, six rebounds and six assists for the Pelicans (11-14), who dropped their fourth straight game.  Ryan Anderson  and  Eric Gordon  each added 18 points for the losers. 
 
 Nicolas Batum 's two foul shots made it 110-107 with 12.4 seconds remaining. The Pelicans got two 3-point attempts in the closing seconds -- by Anderson and then Evans -- but neither went down. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Believe it or not, we still keep preaching defense. We had a slow start, but one thing about our team -- we keep competing. As a coach, that's what you want your team to do. We keep finding ways to win. We make stops when we need them. We make shots when we need them."  
 -- Portland coach  Terry Stotts 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Lillard joins Golden State's  Stephen Curry  and Oklahoma City's  Kevin Durant  as the only players with three straight games of 29 points and five assists or more this season. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  New Orleans led 49-36 midway through the second quarter before the Blazers went on a 13-0 tear to tie the count at 49-49 with a minute to go before halftime. From there, it was back and forth the rest of the way. 
 
 HOT:  After starting the game 1-for-6 from the field, Lillard made 10 of his final 15 shots. 
 
 NOT:  Aldridge started 2-for-10 and never really warmed up, finishing 8-for-24. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:   "There are a lot of things I'd like to say that wouldn't be appropriate, because I thought our guys battled and some things didn't go our way tonight."  
 -- New Orleans coach  Monty Williams  on the referees 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Davis streaked out to swat Lillard's 3-point attempt away in the first quarter. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Nobody picked up Davis' man, Aldridge. After the Blazers retrieved the rebound, Batum fired a lob pass into Aldridge, who dunked it with Davis flying by in pursuit. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:   "I've been a little surprised. I'm not going to lie. But the second I got here and started playing with the guys, I had a very positive feeling. Chemistry has come together very quickly."  
 -- Portland center  Robin Lopez 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Portland is 6-0 in games coming off losses. ... The Blazers own a streak of 15 consecutive games having scored 100 or more points, the franchise's longest since 1991. ... Davis was making his first start for New Orleans after missing seven games with a broken bone in his left hand. Davis had come off the bench in the Pelicans' 108-95 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers Wednesday night, 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Pelicans, Monday @ Sacramento, Friday vs. Denver, Saturday @ Houston. For the Trail Blazers, Thursday vs. L.A. Clippers, Saturday vs. Miami, Monday @ New Orleans.
