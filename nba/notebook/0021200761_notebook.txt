 THE FACTS: Chris Paul  notched his 18th double-double of the season with 21 points and 11 assists, leading the Los Angeles Clippers to a resounding 107-90 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers Monday night at the Wells Fargo Center.  Blake Griffin  and  Jamal Crawford  scored 20 points each,  Matt Barnes  had 11 and  Eric Bledsoe  10 for the Clippers, who improved to 4-4 on their eight-game road trip and 37-17 overall.  DeAndre Jordan  was active all night and ended up with 10 rebounds. 
 
 Nick Young  scored 29 points for the Sixers, who fell to 22-28.  Evan Turner, Jrue Holiday  and  Jeremy Pargo  scored 10 points each. The Sixers finished their eight-game homestand at 5-3. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We got it going early and kept it going all night. It was great to see, especially on the final game of a very long road trip." --  Crawford. 
 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Clippers shot a season-high 58.7 percent from the field. They are 16-2 when shooting 50 percent or better this season. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Clippers built a 56-33 lead at halftime and never looked back. The advantage eventually swelled to 32. Enough said. 
 
 HOT:  Crawford was 8-for-10, Paul was 9-for-11 and Griffin knocked down nine of his 14 shots. 
 
 NOT:  Holiday and Turner were each 4-for-14 while Pargo was 4-for-12.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I felt they had everything going tonight." --  Young. 
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Paul had 21 points, 11 assists, five steals and two rebounds in 24:34. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The crowd of 17,550 was anticipating this matchup against the Clippers, but those cheers soon turned to boos as the visiting team ran away with an easy victory. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "He controlled the whole game. That's great players do." --  Clippers coach  Vinny Del Negro. 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Clippers kept attacking the rim the entire night. When they weren't penetrating, they were getting wide-open looks, thanks to the brilliant playmaking ability of Paul. Pick-and-rolls resulted in either short jumpers or drives to the basket. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Sixers could have been more aggressive in the low post, both offensively and defensively. They settled for too many jumpers on offense and allowed the Clippers way too many easy baskets. Not a good combination. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Sixers forward Arnett Moultrie had eight points and six rebounds in 26:14. The Clippers have no rookies on their roster. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Injured Sixers center  Andrew Bynum  met with reporters about 45 minutes before tip-off. Bynum had been hoping to make his Sixers debut this month, but nothing is certain. "I'm not sure," Bynum said. "It's all going to depend if I have a setback." Bynum added that his left knee is still sore but there's no swelling. ... Clippers forward  Caron Butler  was out with a sore lower back and was replaced in the starting lineup with Barnes. ... Clippers guard  Chauncey Billups  was scratched just before tip-off and replaced with  Willie Green  in the starting lineup. ... The Sixers never led, marking the fourth time it has happened this season. ... Young has scored 20 or more points in four of the last nine games. ... Over the past two games, Paul is averaging 23.0 points on 67.9 percent shooting. ... The Clippers improved to 24-6 when scoring 100 or more points this season. ... The Sixers dropped to 4-15 when allowing 100 or more points. ... The Clippers had 29 assists and just 13 turnovers. ... The Clippers have won four of the last six games against the Sixers after losing four straight from Feb. 9-Dec. 31, 2008. ... Over the past four games, the Sixers are 10-for-58 from beyond the arc.
