 THE FACT:   Lou Williams  came off the bench to score 10 of his season-high 28 points in overtime -- all from the free-throw line -- to lead the Hawks to victory. 
 
 THE LEAD:  The Atlanta Hawks (17-13) were not sharp in their first game since losing center  Al Horford  to a torn right pectoral muscle, but in the fourth quarter they sank six 3-pointers to force overtime and grab a 118-116 win over the visiting Charlotte Bobcats (14-17) Saturday. It was Atlanta's third overtime game in as many outings. The Hawks have won five of six.  
 Atlanta power forward  Paul Millsap  continued his All-Star caliber campaign with a season-high 33 points and 13 rebounds. Reserve center  Pero Antic  made a long ball with three seconds left in regulation to force the bonus period. He was off-balance on one leg at the time, falling away from the basket as he chucked it up. Williams and point guard  Jeff Teague  (20 points, nine assists) each made four 3-pointers for Atlanta. 
 Charlotte center  Al Jefferson  had his way inside while scoring 24 points and grabbing a season-high 23 rebounds, but the Bobcats blew a 14-point third quarter lead -- and then a six-point lead with 5:53 left in the final period -- in the loss.  Gerald Henderson  scored 22 for the Bobcats, and fellow guard  Kemba Walker  had 16 but shot just 4-for-20. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "People don't know, but Pero practices that shot all the time. I just couldn't believe that he did that. It was a crazy shot. It should be in the top 10." 
 -- Hawks reserve forward  Mike Scott 
 
 
 THE STAT:  100 percent -- The Hawks were 12-for-12 from the free-throw line in overtime, where they won despite shooting just 2-for-8 from the field. Williams made all 10 of his free throws in overtime, and Millsap made both of his. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Both teams were kind of floundering in the fourth quarter before Atlanta warmed up in time to force overtime.  Kyle Korver  hit a 3-point shot with 3:53 left in regulation off an assist from Antic (who had seven) to pull the Hawks within 92-89, and Atlanta tied it on a Scott trey with 1:30. Charlotte took the lead three more times, but when Walker split a pair of free throws with 18 seconds left, the Bobcats missed a chance to take a two-possession lead (99-96) and leave the opportunity for Antic's off-balance tying shot with three seconds to go. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "This is a game we should have won. My guy hits a 3-point shot going left, off one leg, to tie the game. What can you say? It's part of the game, I guess." 
 -- Atlanta's Al Jefferson 
 
 
 HOT:  Over the past three games, Teague averaged 26.7 points, 10.3 assists, 2.3 steals and shot 31-for-58.  
 
 NOT:  Antic's only made shot (in seven tries) was a big one as his 3-pointer with three left in regulation helped force overtime, but he's shot just 2-for-10 in his last three games. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "I just told (players) that we have to get past the point where everybody is happy with the fact that the Bobcats are not getting beat every night because we're better than this." 
 -- Bobcats coach  Steve Clifford 
 
 
 NOTABLE: Elton Brand  made his first start of the season, for Horford, but the Hawks really manned the center position by committee. Brand had three points and four rebounds in 19:03, Antic had three points, four rebounds, seven assists and three blocks in 22:22, and  Gustavo Ayon  had two rebounds and a steal in 4:20.  
 
 UP NEXT : For the Bobcats, Monday @ Utah, Wednesday at L.A. Clippers, Thursday @ Portland. For the Hawks, Sunday @ Orlando, Tuesday @ Boston, Friday vs, Golden State.
