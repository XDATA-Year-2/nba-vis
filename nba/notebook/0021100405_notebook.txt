  Notebook: Mavericks 97, Trail Blazers 94 Posted Sunday February 12, 2012 12:34AM By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  The third time was the charm for  Dirk Nowitzki , who missed potential game-winning shots at the end of regulation and the first overtime Saturday before swishing a fadeaway jumper with 16.9 seconds left in double-overtime to clinch the Dallas Mavericks' 97-94 victory against  LaMarcus Aldridge  and the Portland Trail Blazers at the American Airlines Center. Nowitzki's 20 points paced five players in double figures for the Mavericks, who have won three straight.  Jason Terry  added 19 points and  Shawn Marion  had 14 points and 12 rebounds. Aldridge had a huge night in front of family and friends in his hometown, scoring 33 points on 14-for-26 shooting with 12 rebounds. He scored 15 in the fourth quarter to rally Portland, who trailed by 18 in the first half and didn't take its first lead until the first bucket of overtime.  Jamal Crawford  scored 19 off the bench, but shot just 6-for-23 and was 1-for-7 behind the arc, including a desperation 26-footer at the buzzer that would have forced a third OT. QUOTABLE:  "We've just got to make breaks for ourselves. We had opportunities, and we've had them all season long, where you've got to make plays, you've got to make shots, you've got to get stops. Again tonight, we don't make shots when we have the opportunity."  --  Portland head coach  Nate McMillan , whose team is 0-3 in overtime games. THE STAT:  Despite having the oldest legs in the league (average age 30.3 years), the Mavericks improved to 7-3 this season in the second game of back-to-backs. TURNING POINT:  The game was knotted at 93-93 when Dallas center  Brendan Haywood  rebounded a miss by Marion and stuck the clutch putback with 45.3 seconds left. After a miss by Crawford, Nowitzki drilled his 15-foot dagger from the top of the key over Aldridge's outstretched arm. HOT:  Portland made eight of its last 10 shots in regulation, including a game-tying turnaround jumper by Aldridge with 12.9 seconds left. NOT:  The Trail Blazers scored their fewest points in the first quarter (14) and first half (32) this season, erasing the previous lows of 17 (two times) and 34 (Jan. 6 at Phoenix). BAD MOVE:  Dallas turned the ball over 23 times (six by Terry), leading to 23 points for Portland. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT: Gerald Wallace  had a double-double for Portland with 10 points, 10 boards and four steals.  Nicolas Batum  added 12 points, seven rebounds and three blocked shots.  Lamar Odom  scored 10 points off the bench and  Jason Kidd  tallied eight rebounds and eight assists for the Mavericks.  Delonte West  scored the Mavs' first six points of the second extra session with three straight midrange jumpers and finished with 10 points, four assists and four steals. NOTABLE:  The game featured the last three winners of the NBA Sixth Man of the Year award: Odom (2010-11), Crawford (2009-10) and Terry (2008-09). ... Terry (15,956 points) passed  "Pistol" Pete Maravich  (15,948) for 93rd place on the NBA's all-time scoring list. ... Portland shot 37 percent from the field and just 15 percent (3-for-20) from 3-point range. ... Dallas won the battle of the boards, 57-46. ... The Mavericks improved to 2-0 in overtime games. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Monday vs. Los Angeles Clippers, Wednesday vs. Denver, Friday @ Philadelphia. For the Trail Blazers, Tuesday vs. Washington, Wednesday @ Golden State, Thursday vs. Los Angeles Clippers.
