 THE FACT : The 76ers have lost five of the past six games against the Pistons, including both contests this season. 
 
 THE LEAD: Josh Smith  turned in one of the most impressive performances in the league this season in leading the Detroit Pistons past the Philadelphia 76ers, 114-104, Friday night at the Wells Fargo Center. Smith had 22 points, 13 rebounds, seven assists, five blocked shots and four steals while becoming just the third player in NBA history to post these numbers. The other two? Try  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  and  Hakeem Olajuwon .  Brandon Jennings  scored 19 points, 18 in the second half, while  Kyle Singler  and  Will Bynum  had 16 points each.  
 
 Greg Monroe  had 15 points and 10 rebounds and  Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  added 12 points.  Andre Drummond  had 11 points, 12 rebounds and a career-high six blocked shots. The Pistons snapped a six-game losing streak and improved to 15-22. 
 
 Thaddeus Young  paced the Sixers with 22 points while  Michael Carter-Williams  added 21 points.  Evan Turner  contributed 19 and  Spencer Hawes  had a double-double -- 16 points and 10 rebounds.  James Anderson  also had 10 points for the Sixers (12-24), who lost their third game in a row. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Hopefully, this is a stepping-stone for us to get it going." --  Pistons coach  Maurice Cheeks 
 
 
 THE STAT : The Sixers were outrebounded 62-42. They have been outrebounded by 10 or more in each of the past four games. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Leading 100-98 late in the fourth quarter, the Pistons scored five in a row and pulled away from that point. Jennings' fourth triple of the game gave the Pistons a 105-98 advantage with 3:21 remaining. 
 
 HOT : Monroe was very effective, going 5-for-6 from the field. Bynum knocked down six of his 11 shots off the bench. 
 
 NOT: Tony Wroten  struggled with his shot (1-for-6) in 21:18 for the Sixers. He missed the previous two games with flu-like symptoms and a migraine. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Pistons took 30 shots from beyond the arc, but they also did a great job of attacking the rim at the appropriate times. They had 62 rebounds and got second and third shots on numerous occasions. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Sixers rushed too many shots from the perimeter. While the Pistons are an imposing team with their size in the paint, the Sixers still could have gotten cleaner looks at the basket. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA : There was a lively crowd of 13,742 at the Wells Fargo Center. Former 76ers All-Star guard  Allen Iverson  took in the action and received a standing ovation.  Marion Bartoli , the 2013 women's champion at Wimbledon, attended the game. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I still thought we got the shots we wanted." --  Sixers guard Turner 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Pistons tied a floor record with 25 offensive rebounds. ... The Sixers have allowed at least 10 triples by an opponent in three straight games. ... Hawes posted his 12th double-double of the season. ... Young has scored 20 or more points in eight of the past 10 games. ... The Sixers are 2-7 when being outrebounded by 10 or more. ... The Pistons blocked 14 shots compared to three for the Sixers...Philadelphia has allowed at least 100 points in 32 of its 36 games this season.

 QUOTABLE III:  "In the second half, we turned up our energy." --  Pistons guard Jennings
