  Nuggets-Suns notebook   By Jonathan Dalton, for NBA.com Posted Friday March 11, 2011 1:43AM THE FACTS:   Nene  scored 22 points and  Ty Lawson  added 20 as the Denver Nuggets routed the Phoenix Suns 116-97 on Thursday night to give coach  George Karl  his first win in the Valley of the Sun in more than 13 years. Karl's last victory in Phoenix came on December 28, 1997 as coach of the Seattle Supersonics when  Detlef Schrempf  scored 25 points. The Nuggets snapped a 12-game losing streak at the U.S. Airways Center. Lawson added 11 assists and  Wilson Chandler  scored 16 points for the Nuggets, who led by as many as 24 points en route to their largest margin of victory since a 112-88 win over Golden State. Denver won the season series against Phoenix for the first time since 2003-04. Marcin Gortat  had 14 points and 18 rebounds for his 14th double-double off the bench and  Jared Dudley  added 13 points off the bench for the Suns, whose starters shot just 37.7 percent from the floor (17-for-45). As a team, the Suns finished at 41.1 percent including 22.7 percent -- 5-for-22 -- from beyond the 3-point line. QUOTABLE:  "He [Karl] said he hasn't won here since he was at Milwaukee [actually Seattle] so it was big for coach. Now he can rest easy when he comes to Phoenix."    -- Nuggets guard Ty Lawson. THE STAT:  The Suns turned the ball over 20 times, leading to 32 Nuggets points.  Steve Nash  lead the way with six turnovers to go with his seven assists and seven points. Denver also outscored the Suns 33-10 on the fast break. TURNING POINT:  Trailing 50-38 with 3:51 left in the first half, Nash scored four points and  Hakim Warrick  converted a 3-point play to pull the Suns within 53-49 with 1:25 left before halftime. But three turnovers in the final 6.1 seconds of the half -- two by Warrick, one by  Grant Hill  -- allowed the Nuggets to cap a 6-0 run and take a 59-49 lead into the locker room. QUOTABLE II:  "Once they got inside they picked us apart with layup after dunk after layup."    -- Suns coach  Alvin Gentry . HOT:  The Nuggets roamed free in the key, outscoring the Suns 66-42 in the paint. Nene and  Chris Andersen  (6-for-6, 12 points) were the primary beneficiaries of Phoenix's soft defense inside. NOT:  Denver's victory was only the second by the road team in the teams' series in the last 17 games dating back to the end of the 2006-07 season. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Admiral  Mike Mullen , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was in attendance. NOTABLE:  Gortat is one shy of  Maurice Lucas ' franchise record for double-doubles off the bench despite starting the season in Orlando. ... Every active player on both rosters scored except Denver's  Melvin Ely , who did not play. UP NEXT:  For the Nuggets, Saturday vs. Detroit, Monday at New Orleans, Wednesday at Atlanta. For the Suns, Sunday vs, Orlando, Monday at Houston, Wednesday at New Orleans.
