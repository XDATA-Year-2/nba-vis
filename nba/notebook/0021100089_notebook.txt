  Notebook: Grizzlies 90, Timberwolves 86   By Jim Beilby, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday January 4, 2012 11:42PM THE FACTS:  On the day the Memphis Grizzlies found that they would be without  Zach Randolph  for 6-8 weeks, they found a way to get their first road win of the season, defeating the Minnesota Timberwolves 90-86 on Wednesday night.  While the Grizzlies continued their dominance in the paint (outscoring Minnesota 48-36), it was their defense that made the difference. They held a Minnesota team that had made 57 percent against San Antonio on Monday night to 40.2 percent shooting. They tallied 13 steals and turned 17 Minnesota turnovers into 23 points. And despite playing the night before in Sacramento, Memphis started quickly. Tough defense led to 1-for-16 shooting by Minnesota and a 15 point lead after the first 7:30.  Kevin Love  scored 27 points and grabbed 14 rebounds and  Ricky Rubio  tallied his second double-double (12 points and 10 assists) in the losing effort. QUOTABLE:  "We had the lead at halftime and they came out with a lot of energy and we played tired. . . . But we rose up in the fourth quarter, we made a lot of big stops, got rebounds, and steals. . . We had some guys running on fumes tonight and we just kept battling and hung in there."   -- Memphis coach  Lionel Hollins THE STAT:  Memphis made its free throws down the stretch, going 12-for-13 from the line in the fourth quarter. Minnesota, on the other hand, only made 13-for-24 (54.2 percent). And Memphis' 12 turnovers only led to seven Minnesota points, while Memphis got 23 points off Minnesota 17 turnovers. TURNING POINT:  After trailing by as many as five in the final quarter, Memphis'  Rudy Gay  and  O. J. Mayo  engineered a series of strong offensive possessions. And  Tony Allen  made both free throws on a flagrant-1 call on  Luke Ridnour , giving Memphis an eight-point lead with 4:07 to play. From that point on, strong defense and made free throws gave Memphis the win. NOTABLE:  With his 27 points and 14 rebounds, Love became the first player to start the first six games of the season with at least 20 points and 12 rebounds.  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  was the last to do it in 1975. UP NEXT:  For the Wolves, Friday vs. Cleveland, Sunday @ Washington, Monday vs. Toronto. For the Grizzlies, Friday @ Utah, Sunday @ Lakers, Tuesday vs. Oklahoma City.
