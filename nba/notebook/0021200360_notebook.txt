 THE FACTS: Luol Deng  and  Carlos Boozer  each scored 21 points, and  Joakim Noah  had his second career triple-double with 11 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists as the Bulls dominated the visiting Boston Celtics 100-89 on Tuesday. The Bulls maintained the lead that came from a very well played first half, and never trailed in the second half.  Rajon Rondo  had 26 points for the Celtics, who have lost three games in a row.     
 
 
THE FACTS II : The Bulls played a tremendous first half on the way to a 55-48 halftime lead. They shot 54 percent from the field, made all nine free throws, had only three turnovers, and had 17 assists on 22 baskets. 
 
 
FUN FACTS : The Bulls scored almost as many points in the first half Tuesday (55) as they did in the entire game against Memphis on Monday (71). 
 
 
QUOTABLE I : "We are not a good team right now. This is who we are. We are a .500 team." 
 
-- Boston coach  Doc River s, whose club fell to 12-12 with the loss. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Bulls shot better from 3-point range (56 percent) than overall (50 percent).  Nate Robinson  was 5-for-7 from 3-point range and 1-for-5 from inside the arc.  
 
 
 THE STAT II:  The Bulls outrebounded the Celtics 43-35 and had 10 blocked shots (Noah with three) while the Celtics only had two blocks. 
 
 
 THE STAT III:  The Bulls bench outscored the Celtics bench 37-16, led by Robinson's 18 points. 
 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Bulls scored nine straight points at the end of the third quarter to spread a three-point lead into a 12-point advantage. They led by as many as 21 in the fourth quarter before letting the Celtics have the last 10 points of the game.  
 
 
 INJURY UPDATE:   Kirk Hinrich  of the Bulls played 23-plus minutes in the second game after coming back from a bruised knee. He missed both shots he took and did not score.   
 
 
 HOT:  Boozer was 10-for-17 from the field and added 12 rebounds for the Bulls.  
 
 
 NOT:  The Celtics bench was 5-for-23 from the field for its 16 points.  Jared Sullinger  missed all six of his shots and had more fouls (four) than rebounds (three) in 15 minutes. 
 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Nothing better."  
-- Bulls center Joakim Noah when asked about how it feels to beat the Celtics. Noah was responsible for starting a rivalry between the two teams with a spirited performance in the playoffs several years ago.  
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Uncharacteristically, Bulls coach  Tom Thibodeau  started the second quarter with starting center Joakim Noah and four bench players --  Jimmy Butler, Taj Gibson , Nate Robinson and rookie  Marquis Teague . The Bulls increased a five-point lead to a 13-point edge with the four bench players in.  
 
 
 BAD MOVE:  It's called the Rush Street factor. Chicago is perhaps the most popular city for NBA teams to visit because of its accessible and abundant night life, and the Celtics went straight from San Antonio to Chicago on Sunday, spending three days in town.  
 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Bulls are 4-2 on their current stretch against teams with winning records. They still have four more games against winning or .500 teams before playing Washington Dec. 29. ... The Bulls were credited with 28 assists on 37 baskets. ... The Celtics only had nine turnovers in the game.  
 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Bulls, Friday @ New York, Saturday @ Atlanta, Tuesday vs. Houston. For the Celtics, Wednesday vs. Cleveland, Friday vs. Milwaukee, Tuesday @ Brooklyn.
