  Suns-Kings notebook   By Mike Tulumello , for NBA.com Posted Sunday February 13, 2011 11:42PM THE FACTS:  The Sacramento Kings don't figure to be in a big hurry to reinstate  DeMarcus Cousins . With the talented but temperamental rookie sitting out in the aftermath of a fracas with a teammate, the Kings came through with one of their season's biggest wins Sunday night: a 113-108 shocker over the Phoenix Suns in Arizona. Cousins, the Kings' prize rookie big man, sat out after his role in an altercation with teammate  Donte Greene . The incident took place after Saturday night's narrow loss to the Thunder. The rookie reportedly was upset he didn't get the ball on the game's final play, which ended up as a missed 3-pointer by  Tyreke Evans . Coach  Paul Westphal  declined to say whether Cousins will sit out additional games. As it turned out, Greene played a huge role in the win. He was among a host of Kings who hit clutch shot after clutch shot in the closing minutes to prevent a Suns' rally. With the Kings leading 93-89 with 5:30 left,  Carl Landry  hit a follow shot and a mid-range turnaround, then, with the Suns matching them at the other end,  Beno Udrih  nailed a 27-footer to give the Kings a 100-93 lead. After the Suns'  Grant Hill  hit a short jumper, Greene hit a 10-foot turn-around, then drove to the hoop and coverted a 3-point play for a decisive 107-100 lead with 43 seconds left. Evans led the Kings (13-38) with 21 points.  Samuel Dalembert , who started for Cousins, had 18 points and 15 boards. Green shot 7-for-10 for 19 points. Landry, after shooting 0-for-6 in the first half, finished with 20 points and 10 boards. The loss is crushing for the Suns' playoff hopes. The Suns (26-26) had gone 7-1 after dropping to 20-24 a couple of weeks ago. They'd also gone 11-4 since Jan. 12, the NBA's second-best mark in that span behind San Antonio (13-3). The loss drops them to are three games behind Portland (30-24) for the No. 8 and final playoff spot in the West. "This is a loss where, when you look back, it's going to hurt," Suns coach  Alvin Gentry  said. "We have to leapfrog a couple of teams just to get to the eighth spot. "We have 30 games left. We have to find a way to win a ton of them." Steve Nash  had 22 points and 18 assists while  Marcin Gortat  added 20 points and 12 boards. QUOTABLE:  "There's a lesson to be learned...Basketball is a team game."   -  Westphal. THE STAT:  The Kings outrebounded the Suns 51-36. TURNING POINT:  The Kings, down 81-78 to start the fourth quarter, went on a 15-2 run to take a 93-83 lead with 6:00 left. QUOTABLE II:  "The last six weeks, couple months, he's made great progress. He's a passionate guy, a very talented player. It was a step back...for sure."   -  Westphal on the volatile Cousins . GOOD MOVE:  Westphal gave Green extended time (26 minutes) and was rewarded with the two clutch shots to seal the big road win. BAD MOVE:  Gentry probably stuck with rookie  Zabian Dowdell  too long (11 minutes). Dowdell had three turnovers and kept shooting (2-for-8) instead of passing (one assist). With him running the show, the Suns fell apart to start the fourth quarter. NOTABLE:  The Suns had won 22 straight divisional home games vs. the Kings, Warriors and Clippers since the start of the 2007-08 season. UP NEXT:  For the Kings, Tuesday @ Oklahoma City, Wednesday @ Dallas, Feb. 22. For the Suns, Tuesday vs. Jazz, Thursday vs. Mavericks and Feb. 23 vs. Hawks.
