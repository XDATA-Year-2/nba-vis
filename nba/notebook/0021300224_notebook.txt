 THE FACT:  The Oklahoma City Thunder snapped the San Antonio Spurs' 11 game winning streak while extending their own home court victory streak to seven straight. 
 
 THE LEAD:  On a night when Thunder superstars  Kevin Durant  and  Russell Westbrook  combined to score 30 points on 39 shots, role players  Reggie Jackson  and  Jeremy Lamb  stepped up and took over. They scored 35 points on just 21 shots leading OKC to a 94-88 win over the Spurs. 
 Durant led all scorers with 24 points and all rebounders with 13 boards, but he was just 10-for-23 shooting (1-for-5 on 3-pointers) and Westbrook managed just six points on a horrific 2-for-16 shooting night. But the Thunder point guard dished eight assists and stole the ball twice while defending  Tony Parke r, who led the Spurs with 16 points. 
 Parker also struggled with his shot (6-for-16) with Westbrook in his face most of the night.  Kawhi Leonard  finished with a double-double, 14 points and 10 boards, and  Manu Ginobili  had a dozen off the bench. 
 The story of the night though was the play of Jackson, who tied a career high with 23 points on 10-for-14 shooting. Lamb added 12 on 5-for-7. The OKC defense was stout throughout, holding the Spurs to just 39.1 percent shooting, a season-low. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Reggie Jackson kicked our [expletive] and we didn't shoot the ball very well that's for sure. I thought a pretty good percentage of our (3s) were hurried or frazzled. I didn't like our shot selection." 
 
 --Spurs coach  Gregg Popovich 
 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Our defense was outstanding. They're a hard team to guard but we made them miss shots and that was the key to the game." 
 
 --Thunder coach  Scott Brooks 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Thunder beat the Spurs at their own game, playing better defense (Spurs shot 39.1 percent, OKC shot 46.4 percent) sharing the ball better (OKC had 24 assists to 19 for the Spurs). The Thunder held their own down low (Spurs with 44 paint points, OKC with 40), too. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  A big third quarter for OKC. The Thunder outscored the Spurs 25-15, while holding San Antonio to just 25 percent shooting overall (5-for-20) and 20 percent on 3-pointers (1-for-5) in the quarter.  Serge Ibaka  was huge for the Thunder in the third too, scoring 10 of his 17 points and pulling down five of his 11 rebounds in those 12 minutes. That big third quarter turned a 46-43 Spurs lead into a 68-61 Thunder advantage. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "We hit shots in the third quarter but it's not about offense with us, we really locked in on defense. We played tough, we played physical and I like how we're playing, we're scoring off our defense." 
 
 -- Scott Brooks 
 
 
 HOT:  Jackson was 4-for-4 (nine points) in the first five minutes of the second quarter...through three quarters Lamb was 5-for-6 (2-for-2 on 3s) 12 points...Ibaka was 5-for-8 in the third quarter...Jackson was 6-for-7 (14 points) in the fourth quarter. 
 
 NOT:  Over the first eight minutes the Spurs shot just 28.6 percent (6-for-21)...OKC wasn't much better at 33.3 percent (5-for-15)...Westbrook missed 12 of his first 13 shots...Durant missed seven of his first 10...Leonard and Parker were a combined 0-for-5 in the fourth quarter. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  It was the 120th consecutive sellout (regular season and playoffs) inside Chesapeake Energy Arena. 
 
 GOOD MOVE : Early in the second quarter Thunder guard and Spurs nemesis  Derek Fisher  trapped Ginobili along the right wing with enough tight defense to force a turnover. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Even though the Thunder bench outscored the Spurs bench 18-13 in first half, OKC superstars Durant and Westbrook kept trying to play hero ball putting up 24 of Thunder's 41 shots. The pair combined to miss 18 of those 24 shots. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Thunder center  Steven Adams  played almost 12 minutes scoring two points and grabbing three rebounds. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Thunder are now 42-1 since the start of last season when holding a team to 42 percent or worse shooting...OKC is now 7-0 at home, extending their best start to a season since moving from Seattle. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Spurs, Friday @ Orlando, Saturday vs. Houston, Monday vs. Atlanta.  For the Thunder, Friday vs. Golden State, Sunday vs. Minnesota, Tuesday @ Sacramento.
