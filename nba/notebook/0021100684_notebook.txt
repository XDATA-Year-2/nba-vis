  Notebook: Knicks 82, Sixers 79 Posted Wednesday March 21, 2012 10:50PM By Andy Jasner, for NBA.com THE FACTS:   Amar'e Stoudemire  scored 21 points and  Jeremy Lin  scored 18 points despite shooting 4-for-17 in the New York Knicks' 82-79 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers Wednesday night at the Wells Fargo Center.  Carmelo Anthony  added 10 points for the Knicks, who won their fifth in a row. New York improved to 23-24. Jrue Holiday  paced the Sixers (26-21) with 16 points while  Jodie Meeks ,  Lou Williams  and  Andre Iguodala  had 13 points each. The Sixers struggled offensively all night and shot just 39 percent from the field -- 29-for-75. QUOTABLE:  "It was a good test for us to match up with them and see where we are. I think we got off to a good start and were able to hang on at the end. It was a very good win for our team."   -- Lin on the victory. THE STAT:  The Sixers shot below 40 percent for the fourth time in the last 10 games after doing so just five times in the first 37 games this season. The Sixers are 1-8 when shooting below 40 percent. TURNING POINT:  The Knicks played terrific defense in the final two minutes to pull away for the huge road victory. After Philadelphia climbed within 73-71 with 3:05 remaining, the Knicks' defense tightened and forced the Sixers into a number of extremely difficult shots. HOT:  Stoudemire shot 8-for-14 from the field, including a variety of moves from the low post. NOT:   Evan Turner  and  Spencer Hawes  were each 1-for-7 for the Sixers. Neither players could seem to get in the flow of the game. QUOTABLE II:  "It was a big situation for us. We needed a win and this was very important to keep our momentum going."   -- Stoudemire. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Iguodala had 13 points, eight rebounds and six assists in nearly 39 minutes. INSIDE THE ARENA:  This Knicks-76ers regular season matchup had all the intensity of a playoff game. Fans on both sides were buzzing long before the game tipped off. It wound up being a sellout crowd of 20,470. Sixers co-owner  Will Smith  was in attendance.  Spike Lee  took in all the action adjacent to the Knicks bench. In addition,  Scott Hartnell  and  Wayne Simmonds  of the Philadelphia Flyers showed up, and received a nice ovation. QUOTABLE III:  "We just can't start off like that. It's unacceptable."   -- Sixers forward  Elton Brand , on his team's 0-for-14 performance to start the game. GOOD MOVE:  Even when his shot wasn't falling, the Knicks stuck with Lin. It paid off in the final few minutes as Lin put the game away from the free throw line. He was 10-for-10. BAD MOVE:  The Sixers went small for large stretches with either Brand or  Thaddeus Young  at center. The Knicks took advantage of the small lineup down the stretch. ROOKIE WATCH:  Knicks guard  Iman Shumpert  had four points and eight rebounds while center  Josh Harrellson  didn't see any action. For the Sixers,  Nikola Vucevic  and  Lavoy Allen  didn't play. It was a rare occurrence where neither rookie was inserted into the game. NOTABLE:  The Sixers missed their first 14 shots from the field but only trailed 19-11 after the first quarter. Brand's short baseline jumper with 4:12 remaining in the first snapped the maddening 0-for-14 skid. ... Sixers coach  Doug Collins  was denied his 400th career win as an NBA coach with the Bulls, Pistons, Wizards and Sixers. ... Brand did manage 12 points and 12 rebounds for his 10th double-double this season. ... Lin scored 16 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter. ... The Sixers are 2-14 in games decided by seven or few points and 0-8 in games decided by four or fewer. ... The last time the Knicks won a game scoring fewer than 83 points came on Nov. 14, 2005 at Utah in a 73-62 victory. NEXT:  For the Knicks, Friday @ Toronto, Saturday vs. Detroit, Monday vs. Milwaukee. For the Sixers, Friday vs. Boston, Sunday @ San Antonio, Tuesday vs. Cleveland.
