The Warriors led 84-58 at halftime and by as many as 47 points in the second half. Their 138 points and 61.4 percent shooting set season highs. Seven Warriors scored in double-figures:  Monta Ellis  (27),  Dorell Wright  (26),  Stephen Curry  (23),  David Lee  (21),  Al Thornton  (12),  Ekpe Udoh  (10) and  Reggie Williams  (10). The Warriors beat Toronto for the seventh straight time at Oracle and for the fifth straight time overall.  DeMar DeRozan  and  Leandro Barbosa  led led the Raptors with 19 points apiece. Rookie  Ed Davis  had a double-double with a career-high 18 points and 11 boards. Toronto lost its third straight game and fell for the 17th time in its past 18 road games. QUOTABLE:  "We've got to finish strong. That's our No. 1 goal, going out there each night, playing hard and not giving up."    -- Golden State forward Dorell Wright THE STAT:  The Warriors' 84 first-half points are the most by any team in the NBA this season. Denver held the previous first-half scoring mark of 80, set Jan. 15 against Cleveland. Four Warriors scored in double-figures in the first half: Ellis (20), Curry (19), Wright (15) and Lee (12). As a team, Golden State shot 68.9 percent in the first half. TURNING POINT:  The turning point took place shortly after the opening tip when the Warriors started scoring at an alarming rate. The Warriors scored 45 points in the first quarter -- their highest total for any opening quarter this season. They shot a blistering 81 percent (17-for-21) from the field. Even though the Raptors shot 72.7 percent (16-for-22) in the opening quarter, they still trailed 45-36 entering the second. QUOTABLE II:  "We were six deep already at the wing spot. I asked him to go in, he didn't go in. That's fine. I just went back with Leandro. ... I know he went to the washroom just before that so I don't know if he wasn't feeling well. I still have to talk to him about it. But I would have liked him to go in because we have to rest some guys for the game tomorrow."    -- Raptors coach Jay Triano on forward  Julian Wright  refusing to go in the game in the fourth quarter. HOT:  Warriors guards Curry and Ellis are sizzling seemingly every time they face the Raptors. In Golden State's 109-102 win at Toronto on Nov. 8, Curry (34) and Ellis (28) combined for 62 points. This time they teamed up to score 50 on 16-for-30 shooting. Curry entered the game averaging 32.7 points in three career games against Toronto, one of his father,  Dell's , former NBA teams. NOT:   Andrea Bargnani , who averaged 23.3 points over his previous six games, had another tough night against the Warriors, scoring just seven points on 2-for-10 shooting. He entered the game averaging 13 points over nine career games against Golden State and has yet to crack the 20-point mark in a game against the Warriors. He had zero rebounds Friday night. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Golden State's Wright continued to produce big numbers for fantasy team owners. Coming off a career-high 34-point game at Houston on Wednesday, Wright poured in 26 on 9-for-11 shooting against Toronto. He has scored at least 30 points in three of his past nine games. ROOKIE WATCH:  Raptors rookie forward  Ed Davis  got his ninth start of the season, replacing the injured  Amir Johnson  (left ankle), and had a big night, scoring a career-high 18 points and grabbing 11 rebounds. Warriors rookie forward  Ekpe Udoh , starting his fifth straight game, had 10 points, five rebounds and four blocks. NOTABLE:  Toronto starting guard  Jose Calderon  suffered a left hamstring strain with 3:04 left in the first half and did not return to the game. ... The Raptors were without injured backup forward  Reggie Evans  (right foot), as well as backup forward  Joey Dorsey  (flu). ... Barbosa played despite battling a sore left ankle. ... The Warriors had just 10 turnovers. It marked their ninth game with 10 or fewer. ... Lee missed just one shot all night. He was 8-for-9 from the field, 1-1 from 3-point range and 4-for-4 from the free-throw line. UP NEXT:  For the Raptors, Saturday @ L.A. Clippers, Wednesday vs. Milwaukee, Saturday @ Chicago. For the Warriors, Sunday vs. Washington, Tuesday @ Oklahoma City, Wednesday @ Memphis.
