 THE FACTS : Dallas Mavericks forward  Shawn Marion  looked as fresh as ever in his 1,000th career regular-season game. His former team looked exactly like it was playing its fourth game in five nights. Marion tallied 18 points, nine rebounds and five assists to lead the Mavs over the Phoenix Suns in a 110-95 victory Sunday at the American Airlines Center. It was the Suns' 10th straight loss in Dallas. 
 Marion, who played his first 660 games with Phoenix from 1999-2008, is the 107th player to reach that plateau. He wasn't the only player for the Mavericks (19-25) to reach a milestone at the Suns' expense.  Dirk Nowitzki  scored 18 points and passed  Allen Iverson  for 18th place on the NBA's all-time scoring chart. Also,  Elton Brand  played in his 900th game and  O.J. Mayo  delivered his 1,000th assist. 
 The Suns (15-30) fell to 2-2 under interim coach  Lindsey Hunter .  Goran Dragic  paced four Phoenix players in double figures with 18 points and eight assists.  
 
 QUOTABLE : "[Shawn Marion] played extremely well. He stepped up his game tonight, and I thought he was very aggressive from start to finish." 
 --Mavericks coach  Rick Carlisle 
 
 
 THE STAT : It was the eighth consecutive game with at least five Mavericks scoring in double figures. In addition to Marion and Nowitzki,  Vince Carter  added 15 points, Brand finished with 12 and  Dahntay Jones  had 11. 
 
 TURNING POINT : Exhaustion seemed to catch up with the Suns after they made a charge early in the fourth quarter to pull within five. The Mavericks answered with a decisive 10-0 run featuring a 3-pointer by Nowitzki and a three-point play by  Brandan Wright , taking a 91-76 lead with 8:42 to play. During that Dallas surge, the sluggish Suns turned the ball over four times and missed four shots. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "They beat us in every statistical category and we can't possibly manage to win games that way. They capitalized on all of our mistakes. They played with a great sense of urgency and I think -- it's been a long road for us and we've played a lot of games -- we kind of felt sorry for ourselves." 
 --Suns coach Lindsey Hunter 
 
 HOT : The Mavericks shot 51.1 percent and improved to 10-1 this season when they shoot at least 50 percent from the field. They were 5-for-11 from downtown. 
 
 NOT : The Suns shot 23.5 percent (4-for-17) from behind the arc. They are 0-13 on the road this season when making fewer 3-pointers than their opponent. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT : Nowitzki passed Iverson (24,368 points) with a 15-foot jumper with 5:38 left in the third quarter, giving Dallas a 70-60 lead. Nowitzki was 7-for-14 from the field and 3-for-4 at the line with seven rebounds. Next up is Patrick Ewing (24,815) in 17th place. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH : Center  Bernard James  made his first career start for the Mavericks and finished with two points and three rebounds in just under 11 minutes. He ended up with less playing time than backups Brand (16:56) and  Chris Kaman  (11:05). ... Phoenix guard  Kendall Marshall  saw action for the first time since Jan. 12 and scored six points in 14:42 off the bench. He was 2-for-3 from 3-point distance. 
 
 NOTABLE : Official  Leroy Richardson  suffered a left calf strain and left the game at the 8:15 mark of the first quarter.  Derrick Stafford  and  Brian Forte  worked the rest of the game as a two-man crew. ... The Mavericks have scored 100-plus points in eight straight games (6-2 record). ... Dallas used its 17th different starting lineup, the most in the league this season. ... Battling foul trouble all night,  Darren Collison  saw his streak of 16 consecutive games in double figures come to an end with eight points and six assists. ... Phoenix hasn't won in Dallas since March 14, 2007. ... The Mavs are 10-1 when they dish out at least 25 assists (26). ... Dallas has committed fewer turnovers than its opponents in six straight games. ... Phoenix fell to 1-9 on the road against the West. ... The Suns are 2-9 on the second night of a back-to-back. ... Carlisle announced after the game that point guard  Mike James ' contract has been guaranteed for the rest of the season. His second 10-day contract was set to expire Monday.
