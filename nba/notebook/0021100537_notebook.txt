  Notebook: Suns 81, Clippers 78 Posted Saturday March 3, 2012 1:56AM By Mike Tulumello, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  Only the Phoenix Suns and Los Angeles Lakers have won the Pacific Division since the NBA realigned the divisions before the 2004-05 season. The Los Angeles Clippers, leading the division heading into Friday, would like to change that. But they didn't help themselves Friday night when the Suns came from behind then held on for a gritty 81-78 win in Arizona. "Our defense rescued us," Suns coach  Alvin Gentry  said. The Suns limited  Blake Griffin , guarded by  Channing Frye , and  Chris Paul , covered by  Grant Hill , to a combined 12-for-34. The Suns (16-20) shot only 35 percent themselves but got 22 points from  Jared Dudley  and 18 points and 14 boards from  Marcin Gortat .  Steve Nash  had just six points, six assists and seven turnovers. The Clippers (21-13) got a fine game from  Kenyon Martin , 34, who bounced around the floor with great energy in scoring 14 on 7-for-11 shooting and grabbing eight boards. The Suns, who trailed 35-32 at halftime, got their ninth straight home win vs. the Clippers. QUOTABLE:  "I felt like we were dead. We didn't have it."    -- Clippers' Blake Griffin. THE STAT:  The Suns won even though they'd only scored 23 points with three minutes left in the first half. TURNING POINT:  With the score tied 70-70 with 2:40 left, Gortat hit a layup, then, moments later knocked down two free throws to give the Suns a 74-70 lead with 1:57 left. Then, with 30 seconds left and the Suns leading 76-72, Gortat blocked a shot near the hoop by the Clippers'  Caron Butler  to preserve the win. QUOTABLE II:  "They're going to be a very tough out in the playoffs because of Chris Paul and the most athletic player....maybe in the history of sports [Griffin]."   -- Suns coach Alvin Gentry. HOT:  Nobody. NOT:  Frye shot 2-for-18. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Suns rookie  Markieff Morris  has gone south. In the past five games, he's averaged 5.0 points on 8-for-39 shooting. NOTABLE:  The Suns are 4-1 on their six-game homestand. UP NEXT:  For the Clippers, Sunday @ Houston, Monday @ Minnesota and Wednesday @ New Jersey. For the Suns, Sunday vs. Sacramento, Wednesday @ Oklahoma City and Thursday vs. Dallas.
