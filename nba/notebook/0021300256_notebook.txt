 THE FACT:  The Washington Wizards are at .500 for the first time since Nov. 3, 2009 after their 98-80 win over the Orlando Magic. They're 9-9.  
 
 THE LEAD:   Trevor Ariza  scored 24 points,  John Wall  had 16 and 13 assists as the Wizards beat the Magic 98-80 on Monday night.  
 Ariza was 8-for-9 from the field, hit all four of his 3-pointers and his four free throws. Washington led 52-41 at halftime and was never seriously threatened in the second half.  
 
 Arron Afflalo  led Orlando with 21. He had 17 in the first half.  Maurice Harkless  had 16. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "500: It's just something that we knew we could do. We're not satisfied again. We want to continue this winning thing and make it a tradition around here." --  Ariza on the Wizards reaching .500 for the first time in more than four years.  
 
 
 THE STAT:  Orlando's 80 points were the fewest the Magic scored this season and the fewest the Wizards have allowed. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Washington outscored Orlando 17-6 in the last 4:30 of the first half to take an 11-point halftime lead. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I just see the emotion and the happiness that we have in this organization. Obviously, it's big. If you're winning, nobody talks about the small problems, nobody talks about the small problems, nobody talks about the little screw ups and stuff like that." --  Marcin Gortat  on Washington playing cohesively. 
 
 
 HOT:  Ariza is 15-for-19 from the field over the last two games.   
 
 NOT:  The Magic's  Glen Davis  was just 1-for-8 from the field in just his sixth game of the season. Davis missed the first 11 games of the season with a left foot injury. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Wizards coach  Randy Wittman  playing Ariza in place of the injured  Bradley Beal . In the five games that Beal has missed, Ariza has averaged 17.8 points. Beal is the team's leading scorer at 20.6 points per game. 
 
 BAD MOVE : Davis was critical of the team's play-calling. "They're tall. They're real, real tall. I think we should have run more pick-and-rolls. I think it's hard for bigs to guard the pick-and-rolls. This first game was a lesson. They have a big front line. We have to make sure and find their weakness," Davis said. 
 
 NOTABLE:  This was the first of a six-game road trip for the Magic. After playing four sets of back-to-backs to close November, Washington has just four games in the first 13 days of December. 
 
 IN THE ARENA:   Victor Oladipo , the second overall pick in last June's draft, played as a professional for the first time in Washington. Orlando's rookie guard had lots of friends and family on hand and his father saw him play for the first time as a pro. Oladlipo had 13 points on 4-for-12...Afflalo recorded his ninth 20+ point game of the season...The Wizards have won five straight at home...This is the first time the Wizards have boasted a .500 record since November 11, 2009...Ariza has first back-to-back 20-point games for first time since April 2010.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Magic: Tuesday @ Philadelphia, Friday @ New York, Sunday @ Houston. For the Wizards: Friday vs. Milwaukee, Dec. 9 vs. Denver, Dec. 13 @ Atlanta
