  Notebook: Pacers 90, Raptors 85   By Duane Watson, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday December 28, 2011 10:01PM THE FACTS:  Despite leading for much of the game, the Indiana Pacers held off a late fourth quarter run by the Toronto Raptors to defeat them in their home opener, 90-85. The effects of a shortened training camp and brief preseason were on display as the Pacers shot 39.5 percent from the floor while the Raptors were marginally better, shooting 45.6 percent. The Pacers balanced attack was led by  Danny Granger  with 21 points.  Paul George  scored 18 points, and  David West  contributed 14. The Raptors were paced by  DeMar DeRozan  with a game-high 22 points, and  Andrea Bargnani  scored 21 points. The Pacers went on a 15-8 run to end the third quarter, giving them a 63-55 lead going into the final frame that never relinquished. QUOTABLE:  "They've heard for 48 hours since the last game, that every time we run the pick and roll and we hit the pop man and force rotations, we get good stuff. And Danny's 3 was a result of the same thing."   -- Pacers head coach  Frank Vogel  on the key to the game winning shot by Danny Granger. THE STAT:  39.5 percent. The Pacers shot poorly from the field for the game yet were 43 percent from the 3-point line and 86.4 percent from the line to win the game. TURNING POINT:  The Raptors made a run in the fourth quarter to tie the game 83-83 with 1:30 left, despite being down for much of the game. However, Danny Granger's corner 3-pointer with 1:15 in the fourth put the Pacers ahead for good. HOT:  DeRozan went 0-for-4 from the field in the first half, but shot 9-of-12 in the second. Including 12 points in the fourth quarter, finishing with a game-high 22 points. NOT:  The Raptors shot 53.8 percent on 7-of-13 shooting from the free throw line, including an uncharacteristic 2-of-5 from the stripe by Andrea Bargnani. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Pop sensation  Justin Beiber  and rapper  Kardinal Offishall  were in attendance for the Raptors home opener. NOTABLE:  Despite winning only two quarters in the game, the Pacers outmatched the Raptors in second-chance points, scoring 22 to the Raptors 12.
