 THE FACTS:  Unsung Thunder players  Thabo Sefolosha  and  Kendrick Perkins  combined to score 35 points (more than three times their combined averages) to lead Oklahoma City past Phoenix 127-96. Sefolosha had a season-high 18 points on 7-for-11 shooting (4-for-6 on 3-pointers) and Perkins had a season-high 17 points on 8-for-9 shooting. He also pulled down nine rebounds, handed out three assists, blocked three shots and had two steals.  Kevin Durant  (21 points) and  Russell Westbrook  (17 points) did not have to play in the fourth quarter.  Kevin Martin  added 16 points giving the Thunder five players with 16 or more for the first time since Nov. 20, 2009 against Washington. All 13 Thunder players scored and OKC shot 57.5 percent. 
 The Suns trailed by only five at halftime but were blown out 72-46 in the second half.  Michael Beasley  came off the Phoenix bench to score a game-high 25 points on 10-for-16 from the floor. Point guard  Goran Dragic  had 13 points in the first six minutes of the game but finished with just six more.  Jermaine O'Neal  was the only other Suns player in double figures (12 points). 
 The Thunder crushed Phoenix on the fast break scoring 30 points on 13-for-15 shooting and in the paint where OKC outscored the Suns 62-42. 
 After having not won consecutive games since mid-January, the Thunder have taken three straight just this week to sweep their home stand. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We pride ourselves on defense, we consider ourselves a defensive team but this is one of the few games where you can say we won the game with our offense. We were clicking on all cylinders tonight." 
 
 -- Thunder coach  Scott Brooks 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Thunder shot 72.7 percent in the fourth quarter and 63 percent in the second half. Their 72 second-half points were the most scored by Oklahoma City in any half this season. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Thunder came out to start the third quarter determined to put the Suns away and they did. OKC outscored Phoenix 24-5 over the first eight minutes of the quarter while holding the Suns to just 2-for-11 shooting (18.2 percent). 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I love not having to play in the fourth quarter. It's good for my legs and it's good for my body. Scotty (Brooks) always says we have to be ready for the fourth quarter but we haven't had to play one this week." 
 
 -- Westbrook on not having to play in the fourth quarter of any of OKC's three games this week. 
 
 
 HOT:  Oklahoma City hit its first six shots of the game, including two 3-pointers. ... Dragic was 6-for-7 (13 points) in the first six minutes of the game. ... Beasley was 5-for-7 (11 points) in the first half. ... Perkins was 4-for-4 (nine points) in the first half and 4-for-5 in the third quarter. ... The Thunder were 4-for-5 on 3-pointers in the fourth quarter. 
 
 NOT:  After going 6-for-7 in the first six minutes, Dragic finished the rest of the first half 1-for-5. ... Phoenix shot 40.0 percent in the second half. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  Detroit Lions tight end and former Oklahoma State star  Brandon Pettigrew  sat courtside and was part of the 92nd straight sellout inside Chesapeake Energy Arena.  
 
 GOOD MOVE:  After the Suns turned the ball over their first two trips down court leading to five Thunder points, Hunter called a timeout to get his team back on track just 1:07 into the game. The rest of the first half the Suns played the Thunder even-up (50-50). 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Coming out of a timeout in the third quarter the Suns broke the huddle and had six players on the court when play resumed. Durant hit the free throw after the technical foul was called capping off a 15-2 Thunder run. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Thunder are now 17-1 at home against teams from the Western Conference. 
 
 UP NEXT:   For the Suns, Sunday vs. Oklahoma City, Tuesday @ L.A. Lakers, Feb. 19 @ Portland. For the Thunder, Sunday @ Phoenix, Tuesday @ Utah, Thursday vs. Miami.
