  Kings-Knicks notebook   By Adam Zagoria, for NBA.com Posted Friday January 14, 2011 10:56PM THE FACTS:   Beno Udrih  scored a game-high 29 points on 11 of 14 shooting New York shot just 32 percent from the field as the Sacramento Kings knocked off the Knicks 93-83 at Madison Square Garden. QUOTABLE:  "I'm just trying to be aggressive. I'm just trying to find my teammates. And if they [the Knicks] make a mistake on defense, try to take advantage."    -- Beno Udrih THE STAT:  After arriving from Utah at 6 a.m. Thursday morning, none of the Knicks' starters shot better than 50 percent from the field.  Amar'e Stoudemire  was 6 of 22 but still scored 20 or more points (25) for the 24th straight game.  Wilson Chandler  shot 4 of 14,  Raymond Felton  went 2 of 15,  Landry Fields  was 3 of 9 and  Ronny Turiaf  1 of 3. TURNING POINT:  Udrih scored nine points in the third quarter, when the Kings outscored the Knicks 23-16 to go up 69-58. QUOTABLE II:  "He's a slick little dude. He comes off those screens. He's a good passer. He can get to the basket and finish."    -- Kings coach  Paul Westphal  on Beno Udrih HOT:  The Knicks' bench combined for 32 points.  Toney Douglas  put up 21 points on 9 of 17 shooting and  Billy Walker  continued to play well, scoring 11 points on 4 of 6 shooting. NOT:  The Knicks' starters. Aside from Stoudemire, the other four starters combined for just 26 points on 10 of 41 shooting. ROOKIE WATCH:  Kings rookie big man  DeMarcus Cousins  contributed 16 points on 7 of 20 shooting, 10 rebounds and 3 blocks. INSIDE THE ARENA:   C.C. Sabathia  of the Yankees and musician  John Mayer  were courtside. NOTABLE:  Knicks coach  Mike D'Antoni  said of  Danilo Gallinari  and his sprained left knee: "He should be ready [Monday against Phoenix] if practice goes well on Sunday."
