 THE FACT:    Josh Smith  struggled in his return to Atlanta, where Hawks power forward  Paul Millsap  -- who replaced Smith in an offseason swap of free agents --  scored 19 points to lead the home team to a 93-85 win. Smith scored 11 points on 5-for-15 shooting. 
 
 THE LEAD:  This game began miserably as both teams played a night earlier, and energy and focus was absent as the Hawks took a 15-13 lead while the squads combined to shoot 12-for-44. 
 The Pistons (4-7) led 46-43 at halftime, but went cold in the second half while shooting just 16-for-43, or 37.2 percent. Detroit was 2-for-13 on second-half 3-pointers while Atlanta beat the Pistons for the 10th straight time in Philips Arena.  
 
 Rodney Stuckey  was solid off the bench, scoring 18 points, but Detroit starters other than  Brandon Jennings   (game-high 21 points on 9-for-21 shooting) and  Andre Drummond  (10 points on 5-for-11 shooting) were just 9-for-32 combined. Jennings, though, struggled terribly at times defending Atlanta's  Jeff Teague   (18 points, seven assists).  
 Rookie guard  Kentavious Caldwell-Pope , who played at the nearby University of Georgia, scored four points on 1-for-9 shooting. Drummond put together his sixth straight double-double, and eighth overall, with 10 points and 12 rebounds.  
 The Hawks (7-5) had success throughout with the pick-and-roll, and the Pistons -- among the NBA's least effective defensive teams by several metrics -- never figured it out.  
 Small forward  DeMarre Carroll  was quite the complement, scoring 11 points with a career-high 12 rebounds for his first career double-double. The four-year veteran also did a nice job defending Smith much of the time, as Smith has been playing chiefly small forward for the Pistons while  Greg Monroe   has worked most at the power spot.  
 Beyond Millsap, who shot 8-for-14, Atlanta's Teague  shot 8-for-14 and repeatedly found holes in the Detroit to defense from which to score or pass to scorers.  
 Atlanta put the game out of reach with a 22-9 run in the fourth quarter after the game was tied at 68. Teague and sub forward  Mike Scott  scored six points each in that stretch. 
 Detroit struggled not only with its shot after halftime, but in defending. The Pistons took 16 more shots than Atlanta, but surrendered a 50.7 shooting percentage (36-for-71).  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It's important during the season to find a way to win ugly games. I think our group found a way to do that, found some energy when it probably wasn't easy for either group." 
 -- Hawks coach  Mike Budenholzer 
 
 
 THE STAT:   The Pistons entered the game second in the NBA averaging 50.6 points in the paint and they matched that with 50. Problem was, Atlanta also scored 50 in the lane after entering with an average of 42.7 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It was what I expected: a few cheers and some boos, but it's all good. I took shots that I normally take, but they just didn't drop tonight." 
 -- Josh Smith, who played for the Hawks from 2004-'13 
 
 
 TURNING POINT:   When the Hawks began their 22-9 burst in the fourth quarter to break open a tie game, their bench was big. Scott scored the first three points when he was fouled by Stuckey on a layup. Soon after his free throw, reserve guard  Lou Williams  added another three-point play, reserve big man  Gustavo Ayon  tipped in a missed shot and Scott added yet another three-point play to push the score to 79-74 with 6:33 left in the game.  
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "We wanted to get more inside, and didn't get as much as we like to. That was the difference. [The Hawks] got a lot inside and then they got the pick-and-roll going." 
 -- Pistons coach  Mo Cheeks 
 
 
 HOT:  After shooting 2-for-3 from distance, Hawks guard  Kyle Korver  is 36-for-62 (51.6 percent) on 3-pointers for the season. ... Millsap made seven of his final nine shots over the final three quarters after a 1-for-5 first quarter. He was 4-for-4 with 11 points in the second quarter. ... Stuckey scored 12 points in the second quarter, as the Pistons too the lead to halftime. He made 4-of-5 shots in the period, including the only trey he tried, and all three of his free throws.  
 
 NOT:  Atlanta's  Cartier Martin  is in a modest slump. After scoring 16 and 13 points back-to-back against the Bobcats and Knicks, he's gone for zero, eight, five and then two Wednesday. After shooting 1-for-3, he's 5-for-20 over the past four games. He also had three turnovers in just 9:45. In his fourth start, Caldwell-Pope not only shot 1-for-9 but missed all six of his 3-pointers.  
 
 NOTABLE:   Korver's 3-pointer with 2:38 left in the second quarter stretched to 85 his streak of consecutive games with at least one trey made. That ranks second longest in NBA history to  Dana Barros ' run of 89 games. . . . Atlanta's Williams scored six points on 2-for-6 shooting in his second game back after undergoing ACL knee surgery last winter. He scored seven in his first game last Friday, and was then held out of two games. Williams also had five assists in just 14:39. . . . Carroll's previous career high in rebounding came when he grabbed 10 against the Bobcats on Nov. 11. . . . Detroit guard  Chauncey Billups  (left knee) and  Will Bynum  (left hamstring) remained out.  
 
 UP NEXT:   For the Pistons, Friday vs. Atlanta, Sunday at Brooklyn, Monday vs. Milwaukee. For the Hawks, Friday at Detroit, Saturday vs. Boston, Tuesday vs. Orlando.
