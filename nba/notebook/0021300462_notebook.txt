 THE FACT:  The Warriors stayed red-hot, making eight straight shots in the first quarter and breezing to their sixth straight victory. 
 
 THE LEAD:   David Lee  had 22 points and nine rebounds and the Golden State Warriors broke out to a 24-point lead before the end of the first half en route to a 94-81 win over the Orlando Magic. 
 Lee,  Andrew Bogut  and  Draymond Green  helped the Warriors (20-13) dominate the boards and beat the Magic for only the second time in their last 10 meetings. 
 
 Arron Affalo  led Orlando with 15 points, but saw his streak of five games with 20-plus scoring and 50-plus shooting come to a halt. 
 The Magic (10-21) lost center  Nikola Vucevic  to an ankle injury in the first quarter. 
 
 THE STAT:  The Warriors had a 56-37 rebound edge. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Nik being out of the game contributed to us being out-rebounded. At the same time, their ability to shoot the basketball and spread the floor gets us in scramble situations. So now it's me vs. you a lot of times, and if you're faster/quicker/stronger than me, you might get the rebound." 
 -- Magic coach  Jacque Vaughn 
 
 
 TURNING POINT:   Klay Thompson 's 3-pointer broke an 8-8 tie, and by the time the Warriors missed another shot, they had a 13-point lead. 
 
 HOT:  Lee and Bogut combined on 15-for-20 shooting, partly because they crashed the offensive boards. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "[Lee and Bogut] do a great job of handling the paint. ... They sacrifice their bodies in cleaning it up and getting guys in transition." 
 -- Warriors guard  Stephen Curry 
 
 
 NOT:  Afflalo could have become the first player since  Detlef Schrempf  in 1995 to post six straight games of 20 points and shooting at least 50 percent, both overall and from 3-point range. But he fell short on all three counts, shooting 7-for-18 overall and 0-for-4 from long range while scoring 15 points. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "This is not Disney World. People think this is Disney World when they come here; we're 10-21. Yeah, the East sucks, but at the same time, we haven't been competing at all." 
 -- Magic forward  Glen Davis 
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Curry picked the right night for a sub-par game, compiling only nine points (14.4 below his average) and six turnovers. He had eight assists. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  The Magic's  Victor Oladipo  played only 17:23, the second least of his rookie season. 
 
 NOTABLE:  A replay overturned a call of a foul on  Maurice Harkless  as Thompson ended the third quarter with a 3-point attempt. The officials ruled that the contact came after the horn. ... The Warriors closed out the 2013 calendar year at 46-38, the Magic 18-64. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Warriors: Thursday @ Miami, Friday @ Atlanta, Sunday @ Washington. For the Magic: Thursday @ Cleveland, Saturday vs. Miami, Monday @ L.A. Clippers.
