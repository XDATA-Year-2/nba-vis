  Notebook: Lakers 99, Knicks 82   By Dan Arritt, for NBA.com Posted Friday December 30, 2011 2:30AM THE FACTS:  Even if the Lakers don't have a championship-caliber roster, they continue to display championship-style defense, forcing their second consecutive opponent to miss more than a third of their field-goal attempts in a 99-82 victory Thursday night against the visiting Knicks at Staples Center. QUOTABLE:  "I thought our guys were very active defensively, so it was fun to watch ... To hold a team to 82 points on 31 percent from the floor and then only give them nine offensive rebounds, with their size on the front line, was pretty impressive."  --  Lakers coach  Mike Brown  on his team's defensive effort. THE STAT:  The Knicks, coming off a 40 percent shooting performance the night before in a 92-78 loss at Golden State, did not shoot better than 40 percent in any quarter against the Lakers, finishing 21-for-67 from the floor, their worst shooting performance in four years. The 21 field goals were just four off the NBA record for fewest field goals in the shot-clock era. That mark was set by the Heat in an 88-62 loss to the Celtics on March 30, 2008. TURNING POINT:  Brown called timeout with his team trailing, 19-14, and 5:52 remaining in the opening quarter. His message must have gotten through because the Lakers followed with a 13-0 run to take the lead, and the Knicks never got closer than five points the rest of the way. The Lakers took control of their 96-71 victory Tuesday against the visiting Jazz with a 13-0 second-quarter surge. HOT:  Lakers guard  Kobe Bryant , torn wrist tendon and all, scored a game-high 28 points on 10-for-17 shooting. He did most of his damage in the third quarter, scoring 13 points of his team's 17 points on 5-for-8 shooting. His four-point play with 2:25 left in the third gave the Lakers a 78-63 lead. NOT:  Last game it was  Al Jefferson  of Utah who couldn't buy a basket, making a career-worst 2-for-16 shots from the field. This time it was New York power forward  Amar'e Stoudemire  who struggled with his shot throughout the game, missing 13 of 17 field-goal attempts, his worst shooting night in eight years when taking at least 10 shots. His effort came on the heels of a 5-for-14 shooting performance against the Warriors. GOOD MOVE:  Kings power forward  Josh McRoberts  has done an admirable job holding down the starting role while  Andrew Bynum  served a four-game suspension. He brought out the biggest roar from the crowd in the first half when he slammed home a lob from  Steve Blake  to give the Lakers their biggest lead of the first half, 45-29. McRoberts finished with 10 points, six rebounds and three steals in what will likely be his last start for a while. BAD MOVE:  The Knicks finished the third quarter on a 6-0 run to pull within eight points and had the ball after Blake missed a 19-footer to open the fourth, but  Carmelo Anthony  threw the ball away, leading to a 15-footer by  Jason Kapono . The Knicks would commit six more turnovers before they finally got on the board in the final quarter. By then, the Lakers were back up by 12. QUOTABLE II:  "The Lakers are good and we're awful."  --  New York coach  Mike D'Antoni . NOTABLE:  The Knicks haven't defeated the Lakers since February 2007. Bryant has averaged 34 points against the Knicks during that span ... The Lakers shot 23-for-32 in the first half, their highest shooting percentage in a half in 13 years. The Lakers made 77 percent of their shots in the second half against Orlando in March 1999. UP NEXT:  For the Lakers, Saturday vs. Denver, Sunday @ Denver, Tuesday vs. Houston. For the Knicks, Saturday @ Sacramento, Monday vs. Toronto, Wednesday vs. Charlotte.
