 THE FACTS: Russell Westbrook  scored 33 points ? 17 of them in a decisive third quarter ? as Oklahoma City blew out the Portland Trail Blazers 106-90 Friday night at the Rose Garden.  
 Leading 55-54 at the half, Oklahoma City took control in the third quarter, outscoring Portland 26-7 for an 81-61 lead heading into the final period.  
 
 Reggie Jackson  came off the bench for 17 points and  Kevin Durant  added 16 points, six assists and five rebounds for the Thunder (59-21), who moved 1 1/2 games ahead of San Antonio in the battle for the best record in the Western Conference. 
 Rookie  Will Barton  scored 18 points to lead the Trail Blazers (33-46), who suffered their 10th straight defeat and their seventh straight at home, the latter a franchise record. 
 
 QUOTABLE :  "I don't know if we can take all the credit. They missed shots they've been making all year, but our defense was outstanding. Any time you can hold a team under 10 points, you're doing something right." 
 --OKC coach  Scottie Brooks  said of the third-quarter swing 
 
 THE STAT : The Thunder shot .650 in the first quarter, .550 in the first half and .519 for the game ? the seventh Portland opponent in its last eight games to finish at better than 50 percent. 
 
 TURNING POINT : OKC opened the third quarter on a 13-2 run to go on top 68-56. It was all she wrote for the Blazers. 
 
 QUOTABLE II :  "It's tough. I hate losing, especially with the type of season we had. I don't want to go into the offseason on a [13-game] losing streak. I want to win at least one [more] game. It's frustrating to be losing."  
 --Damian Lillard 
 
 HOT : Westbrook made 6 of his 10 shots from the field and 4-for-4 shots from the line in personally outscoring the Blazers 17-7 in the third quarter. 
 
 NOT : Portland made 3 of his 21 field-goal attempts in the fateful quarter. 
 
 GOOD MOVE : The Thunder jumped Lillard on every pick-and-roll opportunity and made him either pass or force up a contested shot. 
 
 BAD MOVE : Three times, Barton simply lost the ball in the dribble while trying to make a move at the basket. 
 
 QUOTABLE III : "He was efficient. He took great shots. He was attacking and putting pressure on [Damian] Lillard and their point guards. He had the hot hand. All night we were trying to feed him."  
 -- Kevin Durant on Westbrook, who outscored Lillard 33-10 and held the likely Rookie of the Year to 3-for-14 shooting 
 
 NOTABLE : The Thunder clinched the Northwest Division championship for the third straight year. They can guarantee themselves homecourt advantage throughout the Western Conference playoffs by winning out against non-playoff opponent Sacramento and Milwaukee (37-41), the latter ticketed for eighth place in the East. ... OKC swept the season series and has won seven consecutive games against Portland. ... Both teams were shorthanded. The Thunder were without starting center  Kendrick Perkins  (hamstring) and sixth man  Kevin Martin  (back). Portland was minus two starters ? shooting guard  Wesley Matthews  (ankle) and small forward  Nicolas Batum  (shoulder). ...  ... Portland's 10-game losing streak is its longest since late in the 2005-06 season. ... During their current five-game road win streak, Thunder have beaten the opposition by an average of 15.6 points. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Thunder, Monday vs. Sacramento, Wednesday vs. Milwaukee. For the Trail Blazers, Sunday @ Denver, Tuesday @ LA Clippers, Wednesday vs. Golden State.
