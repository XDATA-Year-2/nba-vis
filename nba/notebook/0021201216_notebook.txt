 THE FACTS : The Toronto Raptors (34-48) won their season-high tying fifth game in a row by defeating the Boston Celtics (41-40) 114-90 at Air Canada Centre on Wednesday.  
 With the Celtics locked in for the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference, they had very little to play for.  Kevin Garnett  and  Jason Terry  weren't with the team and  Paul Pierce  was limited to only the first of half of basketball due to rest. Toronto was only concerned with finishing the season strong by winning seven of the last eight games and only needed one quarter to assert themselves.  
 The Raptors went on a 10-0 run with 5:44 in the second quarter and took a 59-49 lead into halftime. They continued that same intensity starting the third on a 16-4 run, widening the gap to a 74-56 lead. Toronto extended it to as much as a 27-point lead in the quarter, making it an early night.  DeMar DeRozan  scored 15 in the quarter and finished with a game-high 24 points.  Rudy Gay  added 19 points and nine rebounds, while Jonas Valanciunas had 18 points and three blocked shots. 
 The Celtics were led by  Jordan Crawford 's 16 points and  Terrence Williams ' 12 points, both coming off the bench. Pierce scored 11 points in only one half of play and  Avery Bradley  added 11. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "Three different seasons: a 4-19 start, .500 after that where we had the sixth-best record in the Eastern Conference after the terrible start, then 30-29. If you disregard the 4-19, then we are knocking on the door of the playoffs. We have to get ready for that next step." 
 -- Raptors coach Dwane Casey summing up the season. 
 
 THE STAT : The Raptors shot an impressive 12-for-21 from behind the arc, for .571 percent. Gay made 4-for-6, while DeRozan was perfect shooting 3-for-3. 
 
 TURNING POINT : The Raptors took a 59-49 lead into halftime, with Celtics coach  Doc Rivers  resting Pierce for the second half and Terry and Garnett absent. The Celtics were had pressed to find some offense and defense, and Toronto took the quarter convincingly outscoring them 33-21 for a commanding 96-70 lead after three. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "I wanted to win still, I think you should try and win whenever you have guys. I thought a couple of our guys didn't handle the minutes well, but at least they got to play and that's good."  
 -- Doc Rivers on what he took from the game 
 
 NOTABLE : Both teams and coaches gathered at center court for a moment of silence to honor the Boston Marathon bombings. ....Raptors rookie  Terrence Ross  missed the game with a sprained left ankle. ...  Shavlik Randolph  (lower back) and Pierce (rest) did not return in the second half. ... With the win, the Raptors finished 21-20 at home, their first time over .500 at home since the 2009-10 season. ... Toronto is 25-7 this season when holding opponents under .450 shooting and 32-13 when holding opponents under 100 points. 
 Up Next: For the Raptors, end of season. For the Celtics, at Knicks, TBA (playoffs).
