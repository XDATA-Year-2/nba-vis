  Knicks-Mavericks notebook   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Friday March 11, 2011 1:05AM THE FACTS:   Dirk Nowitzki  scored 23 points,  Shawn Marion  added 22 and  Jason Terry  had 21 as the Mavericks exploded for a season high in points and snapped the Knicks' three-game winning streak with a 127-109 victory Thursday in Dallas.  Amar'e Stoudemire  tallied 36 points and  Carmelo Anthony  had a double-double (18 points, 10 rebounds) for New York, which has dropped 17 of its last 19 meetings against the Mavericks. QUOTABLE:  "I just don't think we had enough energy. We came out like we've played seven games in 10 nights, but that sometimes happens. ... We were just flat at the beginning and it got away from us."   -- Knicks head coach  Mike D'Antoni . THE STAT:  Dallas also registered its highest-scoring quarter (41 points in the second) and its highest-scoring half of the season, taking a 72-51 lead into intermission. The Mavericks shot 58.6 percent (17-for-29) in the second period, including 5-for-6 from downtown. Terry led Dallas with 11 in the second quarter and 14 in the opening half. TURNING POINT:  After calling his team "soft" following Wednesday's late collapse in New Orleans, head coach  Rick Carlisle  encouraged the Mavericks to show more toughness and stop teams from taking "physical liberties" with them. They rose to the challenge and outplayed the Knicks inside. Dallas posted a 47-37 rebounding edge and outscored New York 52-40 in the paint and 30-16 on second-chance points. HOT:  The Knicks (22-for-22) and the Mavericks (9-for-9) made all 31 of their combined free-throw attempts during the first half. New York was 35-for-37 for the game and Dallas finished 20-for-24. NOT:  Coming off back-to-back 30-point games, Anthony was just 5-for-15 from the floor in a relatively quiet performance. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Stoudemire picked up right where he left off in Dallas. After averaging 29.6 points in his last eight visits here while playing for Phoenix, he overcame a 1-for-7 shooting start and collected his 22nd 30-point game of the season. He scored 18 in the third quarter. ... With starter  Tyson Chandler  battling foul trouble all night,  Brendan Haywood  came through with 12 points, eight rebounds (five offensive) and two blocks. INSIDE THE ARENA:  New York Jets running back  LaDainian Tomlinson , who starred collegiately at TCU in Fort Worth, was sitting courtside. The five-time Pro Bowler and 13,000-yard rusher is a native of Rosebud, Texas. GOOD MOVE:  After New York's  Anthony Carter  rebounded a missed jumper by Nowitzki early in the second quarter, Dallas forward  Corey Brewer  picked Carter's pocket in the backcourt, turned around and flushed a one-handed tomahawk slam to put the Mavericks up 36-23. ROOKIE WATCH:  Knicks guard  Landry Fields  had a solid outing with 19 points, six rebounds and four steals. He was 6-for-9 from the field and 6-for-6 at the stripe. NOTABLE:  Forward  Peja Stojakovic  (neck stiffness) missed his second straight game for Dallas and point guard  Chauncey Billups  (bruised left quadriceps) missed his sixth straight for New York. ... The Mavericks improved to 22-8 against the Eastern Conference and the Knicks dropped to 13-16 against the West. ... Dallas was 11-for-24 from behind the arc and has made at least six 3-pointers in 35 consecutive games, the longest active streak in the NBA. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Saturday vs. Los Angeles Lakers, Tuesday @ Portland, Wednesday @ Golden State. For the Knicks, Sunday vs. Indiana, Tuesday @ Indiana, Thursday vs. Memphis.
