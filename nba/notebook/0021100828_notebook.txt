  Notebook: Magic 88, Sixers 82 Posted Saturday April 7, 2012 11:42PM By Mike Radano, for NBA.com THE FACTS: Dwight Howard  scored 20 points and pulled down a game-high 22 rebounds and  Glen Davis  scored a game-high 23 points as the Orlando Magic ended a five-game losing streak with the win. The Philadelphia 76ers loss was their third straight and left them clinging to just a 1 1/2 game lead over Milwaukee for the eighth and final playoff spot. Orlando (33-23) held an early 10-point lead but found itself down ten in the third before it rallied for the win. Thaddeus Young  led the 76ers with 20 points as they fell to 29-26. QUOTABLE:  "I think Glen has played four excellent games in a row. He's been able to shut out all of the distractions. He's not trying to do anything but play the game the best way he can and that's it."  --  Magic head coach  Stan Van Gundy . THE STAT: J.J. Redick  scored 11 of his 19 in the fourth quarter as the Magic rallied for the win. TURNING POINT:  After the 76ers took a 73-72 lead with 6:26 left in the game, Howard made 1-of-2 from the line and Redick hit a pair of 18-foot jumpers in a 5-0 run that gave the Magic the lead for good at 77-73. HOT:  Redick went 4-for-6 from the field in the fourth quarter. NOT: Andre Iguodala  went 2-for-9 from the field. He was far from alone in his struggles as not one starter scored more than seven points for the 76ers. QUOTABLE II:  "It's disappointing to me for us to waste that type of defensive effort. We had 82 points but it's league-wide I guess."  --  76ers head coach  Doug Collins. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Howard's 22 rebounds were a big part of a 53-41 advantage the Magic held on the glass over the 76ers. Howard added a pair of blocks and six assists. INSIDE THE ARENA:  The Wells Fargo Center was ready for a national television audience as the attendance was 19,775. QUOTABLE III:  "Every team in this league has to deal with drama. That is except for the San Antonio Spurs."  --  Collins before the game. GOOD MOVE:  Collins gave his bench significant minutes as  Lou Williams, Jodie Meeks  and Young all played more than 27 minutes and scored a combined 51 points. NOTABLE:  Howard's 22 rebounds were the most by a 76ers opponent this season . . . Local product  Jameer Nelson  (Chester Pa., St. Joseph's University) struggled as he scored eight points on 2-for-12 shooting . . . The 76ers have now lost 10-of-17 at home after opening the season 12-2 at home. . . . The 76ers have held opponents under 100 points in 24 of their last 25 games . . . The Magic went 24-of-31 from the line compared to the 76ers 15-of-20. Over the last 24 games, the 76ers have seen opponents make as many or more free throws then they have attempted . . . NEXT:  For the Magic, Monday vs. Detroit, Tuesday @ Washington, Friday vs. Atlanta. For the Sixers, Sunday @ Boston, Tuesday @ New Jersey, Wednesday @ Toronto.
