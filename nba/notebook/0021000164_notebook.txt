  Rockets-Thunder notebook   By Randy Renner, NBA.com Posted Wednesday November 17, 2010 11:17PM THE FACTS:  Six Oklahoma City Thunder players scored in double figures and 17 Houston Rocket turnovers led to 26 Thunder points as OKC cruised to a 116-99 win before 17,509 fans inside Oklahoma City Arena.  Kevin Durant  and  Russell Westbrook  led the Thunder with 24 and 21 points. Westbrook also added 12 assists. Houston's  Luis Scola  led all scorers with 26.  Kevin Martin  added 19 for the Rockets. QUOTABLE:  "We shared the ball really well tonight, as well as we have all season. Tonight the hustle game was a big factor for us."  -- Thunder coach  Scott Brooks THE STAT:  Oklahoma City turned the ball over a season-low eight times while dishing out a season-high 26 assists. TURNING POINT:  Scola began the game 8-for-12 keeping the Rockets close. But when Scola left the game at 9:30 to go in the second quarter the Thunder took advantage, going on a 10-2 run and pushing a 33-30 lead out to 43-32. QUOTABLE II:  "Our defense was much better in the second half and our bench was just great."  --  Brooks HOT:  Thunder bench players  Nick Collison,   James Harden ,  Eric Maynor  and  D.J. White  shot a combined 15-for-25 and scored 40 points. NOT:  Rockets forward  Shane Battier  was just 1-for-6 for three points. Battier missed all three of his 3-point attempts and was just 1-for-4 from the line. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Scola filled the stat sheet with 26 points on 12-for-19 shooting. He also pulled down eight rebounds. GOOD MOVE:  In the third quarter Westbrook had the ball stolen from him by Rockets point man  Kyle Lowry  but Westbrook refused to give up, stealing the ball back from Lowry and racing down court for a slam. BAD MOVE:  When Houston coach  Rick Adelman  took Scola out early in the second quarter, he was 8-for-12 with 16 points and the Rockets trailed 33-30. Over the rest of the game Scola was 4-for-7 with 10 points and a three point OKC lead became 20 midway through the fourth quarter. ROOKIE WATCH:  Rockets guard  Ish Smith  played 25:31 and scored 12 points on 5-for-6 shooting. Thunder center  Cole Aldrich  was inactive for the game. NOTABLE:  After losing 13 in a row to the Rockets the Thunder franchise has now won two straight, both blowouts. 122-104 last March and 116-99 tonight. UP NEXT:  For the Rockets, Friday @ Toronto, Monday vs Suns, Wednesday vs Warriors. For the Thunder, Friday @ Boston, Saturday @ Milwaukee, Monday vs Timberwolves.
