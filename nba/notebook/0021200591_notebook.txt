 THE FACTS: Bradley Beal  scored 23 points and  John Wall  added 14 points and 12 assists as the Washington Wizards rallied to beat the Denver Nuggets 112-108 for their second road win of the season Friday night. 
 
 Kevin Seraphin  also made a big impact for Washington, scoring 18 points, including an important putback in the final minute. Wizards power forward  Nene  had seven points and four rebounds in his first game at Pepsi Center since being traded from Denver to Washington last spring. 
 Denver point guard  Ty Lawson  scored 23 of his 29 points in the third quarter, but had his shot blocked by Wall with the Nuggets trailing by two with 2.7 seconds remaining. Denver lost for just the third time at home this season. 
 The Wizards, who lost their first 12 games to start the season, have won four of their past five. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It feels great. Honestly, in my mind, we are 5-0 right now, win-streak-wise. It feels good because this is a great team and it shows that we are capable of competing and beating anybody. As long as we keep doing what we are doing and competing every night and playing hard, with passion and integrity, we are going to be fine."  --  Beal. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Wizards prevailed despite committing 21 turnovers that led to 28 point for Denver. They offset the miscues by making 11 of 23 3-pointers. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Trailing by seven at the end of the third quarter, the Wizards opened the fourth on a 12-0 run. The Nuggets seemed stunned by the blitz and never regained the lead in the game's final 10 minutes. 
 
 HOT:  Lawson scored only two points in the first half but exploded for 23 on 8-of-8 shooting in the third quarter. The outburst was reminiscent of two years ago when he hit 10 consecutive 3-pointers against the Minnesota Timberwolves. 
 
 NOT:  At one point in the first half, the Nuggets and Wizards both were 5-for-12 from the free-throw line. The charity stripe has been a trouble spot for Denver all season; the Nuggets are shooting .681 -- last in the NBA. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I was worried the whole game. I thought they were playing better basketball in many ways. Ty has an incredible third quarter that gives us a little bit of fool's gold that we're going to be okay. We've had similar games of not having enough effort, not having enough serious basketball. We've been messing with fire and tonight we got burned."  --  Nuggets coach   George Karl . 
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  In deeper leagues, Nuggets forward  Corey Brewer  can be a valuable contributor. Brewer scored 17 points and added three steals off the bench, raising his scoring average to 11.0. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  With his 23 points, Beal reached double figures for the fifth straight game. He is averaging 20.8 points on .617 (37-of-60) shooting during that stretch. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Washington entered the night last in the NBA in scoring at 90.3 points per game and last in field-goal percentage at 41.5 percent. The Wizards had 92 points less than three minuets into the fourth quarter and finished 41-of-80 (.513) from the field .... Denver had won 24 straight home games when scoring at least 100 points. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Wizards, Saturday @ L.A. Clippers, Monday @ Portland, Wednesday @ Utah. For the Nuggets, Sunday vs. Oklahoma City, Wednesday @ Houston, Saturday vs. Sacramento.
