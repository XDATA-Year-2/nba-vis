  Notebook: Trail Blazers 99, Mavericks 97 Posted Friday April 6, 2012 11:53PM By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com THE FACTS: LaMarcus Aldridge  drained a stepback 16-footer over  Brendan Haywood  as the buzzer sounded to give Portland a hard-fought 99-97 victory in overtime Friday in Dallas. Aldridge scored six of the Trail Blazers' eight points in the extra session and finished with 25 points and 12 rebounds. Raymond Felton , whose perimeter shooting helped Portland overcome a 15-point deficit, had a season-high 30 points, seven rebounds and six assists.  Jamal Crawford  scored 11 of his 14 points during the fourth quarter. Dirk Nowitzki  led six Mavericks in double figures with 23 points and 14 rebounds.  Jason Terry  scored 18,  Brandan Wright  had 13 on 6-for-7 shooting and  Shawn Marion  tallied 12 points, including the game-tying layup that forced overtime with 15.9 seconds left.  Delonte West  and  Rodrigue Beaubois  each scored 10. QUOTABLE:  "We wanted LaMarcus to get the ball. LaMarcus is our All-Star, and he's working his tail off. To his credit, he hit a big-time shot tonight."  --  Portland head coach  Kaleb Canales . THE STAT:  Coupled with Wednesday's 101-88 defeat of New Jersey, Portland has won back-to-back games for the first time since Jan. 23-24. TURNING POINT:  After rebounding a missed 3-pointer by Felton with 22 seconds left and the game tied at 97-97, Nowitzki overthrew a wide-open Marion with a long pass for a critical turnover. Following a timeout by Portland with 3.7 seconds left, Aldridge knocked down the winner. QUOTABLE II:  "They picked up their intensity, their level of play, and we didn't."  --  Mavericks head coach  Rick Carlisle  on the team's dismal third quarter. HOT:  Felton outscored Dallas 16-10 in the third quarter, with 12 points coming during the Blazers' 16-0 run to end the period. He sank three 3-pointers and added a three-point play in that spurt. For the game, Felton was 12-for-18 from the field and 5-for-8 behind the arc. NOT:  The Mavericks were outscored 30-10 in the third, their lowest-scoring quarter of the season. They shot 22 percent (4-for-18) and were killed on the boards (16-8) during the period. GOOD MOVE:  Wright flushed several crowd-pleasing dunks, including an athletic alley-oop finish that put Dallas ahead 41-26 with 7:42 left in the second quarter. He received a pass from Terry with his right hand, then windmill dunked it with his left. INSIDE THE ARENA:  The sellout crowd at the American Airlines Center included a group of exchange students from Nowitzki's hometown in Wurzburg, Germany. NOTABLE:  Mavericks point guard  Jason Kidd  (right groin strain) missed his third straight game and backup center  Ian Mahinmi  was not with the team to attend the birth of his child. ... Terry's 3-pointer in the first quarter was the 1,761st of his career, passing former Maverick  Peja Stojakovic  for fifth place on the NBA's all-time list.  Chauncey Billups  is fourth with 1,783. ... Interim Portland coach Canales went to school and worked as an assistant coach nearby at the University of Texas at Arlington. ... The Blazers won their first overtime game of the season (1-3) and the Mavericks lost their first (3-1). Dallas beat Portland in double-OT on Feb. 11.
