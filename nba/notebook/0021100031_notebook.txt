  Notebook: Sixers 103, Suns 83   By Mike Tulumello, for NBA.com Posted Thursday December 29, 2011 1:54AM THE FACTS:  The Phoenix Suns, synonymous in the NBA with high-powered offense through the decades, can't score these days. The latest team to take advantage was the Philadelphia 76ers, who breezed to a 103-83 win in Phoenix Wednesday night. The game wasn't nearly this close; the Sixers led by as many as 34, 70-36, midway through the third quarter. The Sixers, who evened their record at 1-1, got 15 points each from  Andre Igoudala ,  Jrue Holiday  and  Thaddeus Young . Ronnie Price , the Suns' backup point guard, had 16 points. The Suns, who averaged 105 points last season, are averaging 83.5 after two games and have opened the season 0-2 for the first time since 1996-97. That's the season they started 0-13. QUOTABLE:  "Our defense was superb ... it's what created all of our offense, got us in the open court."    -- Sixers coach  Doug Collins THE STAT:  In rolling to a 48-34 lead, the Sixers had only four turnovers in the first half. TURNING POINT:  Pretty much when the teams took the floor. The Suns had three turnovers (two by  Steve Nash ) and one basket in their first 10 possessions and fell behind 11-1. They recovered to lead, briefly, 16-15 and 17-16. The Sixers dominated the rest of the way. QUOTABLE II:  "It's so hard for us to get a shot off and to get a rhythm. I'm really disappointed, but you can't stay there. I've got to start thinking about what we are going to do in the next game ... We don't have time to linger in pity. We've got to regroup and figure out what we can do."    -- Suns coach  Alvin Gentry HOT: Evan Turner  was 6-for-9 off the Sixers' bench for 12 points. He also had seven rebounds and zero turnovers. NOT:  Nash had one of his worst games as a Sun. He shot 2-for-11 for four points. He also had six turnovers, and -- most stunning -- just one assist. Nash said: "I wasn't able to get it going, and that put a lot of pressure on the offense. We couldn't loosen them up or break them down to create easy opportunities." FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Through two games, Igoudala is averaging 18.5 points on 12-for-21 shooting (57 percent). By contrast, the Suns'  Channing Frye  is averaging 1.5 points on 1-for-10 shooting plus 6.0 rebounds. GOOD MOVE:  None of the Sixers played more than 32 minutes. BAD MOVE? : So far, the signing of free agent  Shannon Brown  has produced little for the Suns. Through two games, Brown has shot 4-for-15 for eight points in 41 minutes. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Suns fans appeared too bored to boo, at least until the Sixers' lead approached 30 points in the third quarter. ROOKIE WATCH:  The Suns  Markieff Morris  shot 4-for-5 for nine points. He is averaging 8.0 points and 6.0 reboounds. In his NBA debut, the Sixers  Nikola Vucevic  shot 3-for-6 for six points plus six boards. NOTABLE:  Collins said he emphasizes the importance of halftime warmups and a strong start in the third quarter. Wednesday, this worked in spades. The Sixers outscored the Suns, 22-2, to start the second half to stretch their lead to 34 (70-36). UP NEXT:  For the 76ers, Friday @ Utah, Saturday @ Golden State and Wednesday @ New Orleans. For the Suns, Friday @ New Orleans, Saturday @ Oklahoma City and Monday vs. Warriors.
