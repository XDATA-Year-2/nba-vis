 THE FACTS: Charlie Villanueva  capped a big night with a tie-breaking 3-pointer with 9.7 seconds left, lifting the Detroit Pistons to a 105-100 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks Saturday night at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. 
 Villanueva finished with 18 points and 13 rebounds, and his 3-pointer made up for a big turnover with 55 seconds left. The giveaway led to a  Brandon Jennings j umper to give the Bucks a 100-98 lead with 47.7 seconds left. 
 
 Jose Calderon  led the Pistons (20-32) with 23 points and 10 assists, and his driving layup with 41.2 seconds left pulled the Pistons into a 100-100 tie.  Rodney Stuckey  added 19 points off the bench, and  Greg Monroe  had 14 points and 13 rebounds for the Pistons, who won for the second time in two nights. 
 Jennings led Milwaukee (25-24) with 26 points and seven assists, but the Bucks lost their third straight and fifth in their last six games. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "I just put it behind me. The intention was right, but I was a little bit off target. But, next play ... I was glad to hit that big shot." 
 -- Charlie Villanueva on his big shot making up for his turnover 
 
 THE STAT : After building a 10-point lead in the third quarter and leading, 82-81 entering the fourth, the Bucks missed 10 of their first 11 shots in the fourth quarter and went just 5-for-21 (23.8 percent) in the final 12 minutes. 
 
 TURNING POINT : Milwaukee used a 10-0 run to take a 72-62 lead in the third quarter when Calderon stopped the momentum with a 3-pointer. Stuckey and Villanueva added 3-pointers over the next couple minutes and the Pistons chopped the lead down to one entering the fourth quarter. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "They're a better team than their record indicates and they're well-coached and stuff, but I don't think I'm reaching when I say we're obviously not on the same page right now. We're in a funk, and we've had a tendency to do that all year. We've gone up and down in waves -- win four or five in a row and then lose four or five in a row. Hopefully, we can snap out of it, but we're not on the same page right now." 
 --  Mike Dunleavy  on the Bucks' poor performance of late 
 
 HOT : Calderon went 10-for-13, including 3 of his 4 attempts from behind the arc, and is 23-for-38 (60.5 percent) in his four games with the Pistons. 
 
 NOT : Jennings (8-for-27),  Monta Ellis  (3-for-9) and  Beno Udrih  (1-for-7) logged all the minutes at guard for Milwaukee and made a combined 12-for-43 (27.9 percent).  
 
 GOOD MOVE : Pistons coach  Lawrence Frank  stuck with Villanueva after his pass went into the fifth row with 55 seconds left, and Villanueva rewarded his coach's confidence with the game-winner. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH : Forward  Kyle Singler  had 11 points and five rebounds in 29 minutes for the Pistons, while Milwaukee's  John Henson  had seven points and three rebounds in just 6 ½ minutes.  
 
 NOTABLE : Bucks center  Larry Sanders  missed his second straight game with a bruised back he suffered Tuesday in Denver. Sanders leads the league in blocked shots at 3.16 per game. ... Bucks forward  Marquis Daniels  missed his second game in the last three to attend to an ill relative. ... Pistons rookie center  Andre Drummond  missed his second game with a stress fracture in his back and will miss 4-6 weeks. ...  Ersan Ilyasova  (15 points, 10 rebounds) and  Samuel Dalembert  (14 points, 12 rebounds) had double-doubles for the Bucks. Dalembert also blocked five shots. ... The Pistons won the season series, 3-1, including both games in Milwaukee. ... Detroit had 16 fast-break points in the first quarter but just one more the rest of the way. ... The Pistons made seven more field goals to offset a 25-15 deficit in free throws made. ... The Bucks were just 19-for-47 in the paint as the Pistons enjoyed a 52-38 edge on points in the paint. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Pistons, Monday vs. New Orleans, Wednesday vs. Washington, Feb. 19 vs. Memphis. For the Bucks, Monday vs. Washington, Wednesday vs. Philadelphia, Feb. 19 @ Brooklyn.
