 THE FACT:  After losing the first two games on their season-long six game road trip, the Philadelphia 76ers have now won three straight.  
 
 THE LEAD:  Philadelphia (11-21) survived a late run by  Jimmer Fredette  and the Sacramento Kings (10-21) and came away with the 113-104 road victory.  
 
 Thaddeus Young  ran circles around the Kings bigs, finishing with a team-high 28 points, seven rebounds and six steals.  Evan Turner  added 24 points, 10 rebounds and six assists, while  Tony Wroten  dropped in 21 off the 76ers bench.   
 
 DeMarcus Cousins  dominated the post, scoring a game-high 33 points and grabbing 14 rebounds.  Isaiah Thomas  scored 14 of his 23 points in a wild third quarter and handed out seven assists in the loss.  Rudy Gay  added 18 points and seven rebounds, while Fredette scored 15 points, all in the fourth quarter.  
 
 QUOTABLE : "He's playing with a high level of confidence first, and then support it by his skill package that's getting better.  You just can't say enough about his game over the recent four or five game stretch."   --  76ers head coach  Brett Brown  on Young's play 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Philadelphia forced 23 Sacramento turnovers that led to 27 points on the other end.  
 
 TURNING POINT : Sacramento cut the 76ers lead down to five in the mid-fourth quarter, but Philly responded with a late run to finish off the Kings. 
 
 HOT : Philadelphia had no answer for Jimmer in the fourth quarter.  The third-year guard scored 15 points on 5-for-8 shooting and knocked down 3-of-6 3-pointers in the final frame.  
 
 QUOTABLE II :  "Too little, too late."  --  Fredette on the Kings' late run 
 
 
 NOT: Marcus Thornton  struggled again this evening for Sacramento, scoring just two points on 1-for-6 shooting in 21 minutes of play.   
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Philadelphia went at Cousins all night long, resulting in five personals for the Kings big man in just 29 minutes of play. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Cousins got into a skirmish with Turner in the second quarter and picked up his 10th technical foul of the season. 
 
 NOTABLE : Young set a new career-high in steals with six. Fredette scored a season-high in points with 15 off the Kings bench.   
 
 UP NEXT : For the Philadelphia, Saturday @ Portland, Monday vs. Minnesota, Tuesday @ Cavs. For the Kings, Saturday vs. Charlotte, Tuesday vs. Portland, Friday vs. Orlando.
