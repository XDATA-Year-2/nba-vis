 THE FACTS:  The Memphis Grizzlies finally got All-Star forward  Zach Randolph  back on track. Going to their big man early and often, Randolph scored 11 of his 21 points in the opening quarter as the Grizzlies snapped their two-game slide with a 103-94 win over the Houston Rockets in front of a sellout crowd of 18.119 at FedExForum Friday night. Randolph also had a game-high 12 rebounds. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I just had to come out and be myself. That's what I tried to do, get post position, get easy baskets and get rebounds."  
 -- Zach Randolph 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Randolph topped the 20-point mark for the first time since scoring 22 against Dallas on Feb. 22. It was just his second 20-point performance since the All-Star break. Randolph had 10 such performances before the All-Star break. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Grizzlies led just 48-47 with just under four minutes remaining in the first half before a tip-in by Randolph ignited a 13-6 run to end the half, giving the Grizzlies a 61-53 lead. From there, the Rockets never got closer than eight points as the Grizzlies led by as many as 17. 
 
 HOT:  The Rockets has no answer for the Grizzlies offense as all five starters, along with backup guard  Jerryd Bayless , scored in double figures. Center  Marc Gasol  picked up where Randolph left off in the second half, scoring 12 of his 21 points, while  Tony Allen  had 16 and  Mike Conley  15. The Grizzlies shot 50.6 percent from the floor, scoring 56 points in the paint. They are now 14-1 when shooting 50 percent or better. 
 
 NOT:  It was an off-night for the Houston backcourt of  James Harden  and  Jeremy Lin . Harden was just 3-for-9 from the floor for seven points, while Lin was 3-for-9 for eight points. For Harden, it was just his second single-digit game of the season, the other coming when he had six against Utah on Nov. 19. Harden entered the game fifth in the NBA with a 26.2 average. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "The Grizzlies took entire control of the tempo. When they played us earlier in the season, we had control of the tempo. We took away their first options on offense. However, they still had open cutters and had open 3-point shots. That is an example of a team that has been playing together, a team that is well-disciplined and well-coached." 
 -- Jeremy Lin 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Houston forwards  Donatas Motiejunas  and  Chandler Parsons  were responsible for keeping the Rockets close in the first half. Both players led the Rockets with 16 points with Chandler going 3-for-5 form 3-point range and Motiejunas making 2-for-3. ... The Grizzlies announced their third consecutive sellout crowd. They last time they had three straight packed houses was during the 2004-05 season, which were the first three games ever played in FedExForum. The Grizzlies are now 5-0 this season in front of home sellout crowds. ... The Grizzlies have won 11 in a row at home, tying the second-longest home winning streak in franchise history. ... The Rockets entered the game second in the league in scoring at 106.1 ppg.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Rockets, Saturday vs. L.A. Clippers, Monday vs. Orlando, Wednesday at Sacramento. For the Grizzlies, Saturday at Minnesota, Monday vs. San Antonio, Wednesday at Portland.
