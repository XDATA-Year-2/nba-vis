 THE FACTS:   Gerald Henderson  scored 27 points to lead all scorers and paced seven Charlotte Bobcats in double figures as they picked up a 119-114 win over the Washington Wizards.  John Wall  scored a team-high 25 points for the Wizards, who had its three-game win streak snapped. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We've got a lot of fight. We had a little bit of a lull in the fourth quarter, but we pulled it back and came together. We got sharp on offense and defense and got it done tonight. We've kept working and it played hard. It feels good." 
 --  Henderson 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Charlotte made 14 trips to the free throw line in the fourth quarter alone and a total of 33 for the game. The Wizards had 29 attempts at the charity stripe, but only four in the final period. The Bobcats were 78.8 percent (26-of-33) from the line for the game including 10-of-11 from Henderson. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Bobcats used a 12-0 run late in the fourth quarter to fight back and secure the win over Washington.  Kemba Walker  started the run with 2:34 to play in the game and Henderson drained a three with :55 to play to cap the run and give Charlotte a 118-111 lead.  
 
 HOT:  First half offense. The Bobcats and Wizards combined for 122 total points. The 63 points by Charlotte matched its highest total this season. The teams shot a combined 59.8 percent (49-of-82) from the floor and 43.8 percent (7-of-16) from behind the arc. Each team had three players in double figures with Henderson leading the way at the half with 14 points.  
 
 NOT:  Washington's bench scored just 22 points and shot 40 percent (10-of-25) from the floor while the Bobcats bench accounted for 44 points Monday night. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Jannero Pargo  has burst onto the scene for Charlotte. Pargo was signed to a 10-day contract on March 14. Pargo led the Bobcats in scoring Saturday in Boston and netted 11 points against Washington Monday night. Pargo has connected on 7-of-12 threes and is averaging 14.5 points over the last two games for Charlotte.  
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The Bobcats and TV partner Fox Sports South had guard Walker wired for sound throughout the game.  
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:   Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  scored 11 points and grabbed seven rebounds for the Bobcats while fellow rookie  Jeffery Taylor  did not play. Washington's  Bradley Beal  was held to five points and four assists. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Bobcats posted season highs in points (119), field goal percentage (.532) and assists (32).  Henderson scored 20 or more for the fourth time in six games and tied a career-best with eight assists.  Ben Gordon  was in double figures for the seventh time in the last eight games. Walker was in double figures for the 14th time in the last 15 games.  Josh McRoberts  is averaging 12.3 points and 9.0 rebounds over the last four games.
