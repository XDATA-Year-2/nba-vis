 THE FACTS:  The Toronto Raptors (15-26) snapped a four-game losing streak defeating the Los Angeles Lakers (17-23) 108-103 at a sold out Air Canada Centre on Sunday afternoon. The Raptors built up a 19-point lead in the fourth quarter and while the Lakers rallied, they didn't squander it. The Lakers have now lost eight of their last ten games and their fifth in a row on the road, with two more to play in Chicago and Memphis. 
 
 Jose Calderon's  22 points and nine assists led the Raptors, while  Landry Fields  added a double-double of 18 points and 10 rebounds along with four steals.  Ed Davis  scored 18 points with eight rebounds and  Alan Anderson  contributed 14 points and eight assists off the bench. 
 After a first quarter where the Raptors led by as many as 16 points, the Lakers made a 17-7 run in the second to bring it to a 53-49 game at halftime. However, the Lakers'  Dwight Howard  was ejected in the second quarter after he earned his second technical foul in the game.  Pau Gasol  scored 10 points and added three rebounds in the third but an 11-3 run by the Raptors to close out the quarter widened their lead to 83-70 after three quarters. The Raptors opened it up to a 19-point lead in fourth, but the Lakers took an 18-6 run to bring the game to six points at 103-97 with 1:35 left. However, Anderson's lay-up and  Kobe Bryant's  subsequent 3-point shot that caught all air, secured the Raptors eleventh home victory. 
 Bryant's game-high 26 points led Los Angeles, while Gasol added 25.  Steve Nash  scored 16 points with nine assists and  Earl Clark  came off the bench with a double-double of 14 points and a game-high 14 rebounds. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It's tough, but as I said, we have to keep competing. We can compete against anybody in this league, we have to do it for 48 and try to minimize those mental mistakes we have sometimes." --  Raptors guard Calderon on his team closing out games. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Raptors free throw shooting was .588 percent, they shot 3-for-7 during the fourth quarter while the Lakers made their run. No team shooting that poorly should win, but the Raptors did. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  With the Lakers on a 18-6 run with 55.9 seconds left in the fourth, Bryant airballed a three-point attempt that deflated the comeback and allowed the Raptors to cling to a  105-97 lead, that subsequently led to a free throw match which Toronto the prevailed. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I've just got to rest my legs. My legs are a little tired. My shots are just short. That's on me. I'll take this loss on me, gladly. There were a lot of easy shots, a lot of them, that I should have put down." --  Kobe.  
 
 
 HOT:  Fields did a solid job of containing Bryant on defense, but also contributed offensively shooting 8-for-11 from the field for 18 points with a double-double of 10 rebounds and added four steals. 
 
 NOT:  Despite his 24 points, Bryant took 32 shots to get them. He had a difficult time dealing with the length of Fields on defense, shooting 10-for-32 from the field and 3-for-12 from the three-point line, with five assists and six turnovers. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  With 1:18 left in the second quarter, Anderson and Howard were hit with double technical fouls. Unfortunately for Howard, it was his second of the game after arguing with officials and led to an automatic ejection. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Raptors are 1-20 when opponents score 100 points or more against them. The Lakers have lost their fifth game in the road in a row for the first time in six years. The Raptors ended a four-game losing streak to the Lakers. Calderon has totaled 72 points and 27 assists while shooting 30 of 47 from the field in his last three home games against Los Angeles. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Raptors: Wednesday @ Miami, Thursday @ Orlando, Saturday vs. Cleveland. For the Lakers: Monday @ Chicago, Wednesday @ Memphis and Friday vs. Utah.
