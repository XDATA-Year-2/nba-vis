
 Bobcats-Pacers notebook   By John Oehser, for NBA.com Posted Friday December 10, 2010 10:16PM THE FACTS:   Danny Granger  scored 18 points and  Brandon Rush  continued to produce off the bench with 16 points, and the Indiana Pacers held off a fourth-quarter surge by the Charlotte Bobcats in a 100-92 victory at Consceo Fieldhouse Friday. Mike Dunleavy  hit three 3-pointers for Indiana, with the biggest coming with 3:51 remaining in the game to push the Pacers' lead to 91-83. Forward  Gerald Wallace  had 26 points and 13 rebounds to lead the Bobcats, who trimmed a 10-point Indiana lead to four at 87-83 with 4:26 remaining before a free throw by Granger and Dunleavy's 3-pointer. Granger shot 7-for-19 from the field for Indiana, but just 1-for-5 from 3-point range. Rush made 4-for-8 3-pointers for Indiana (11-10), which shot 44.2 percent from the field for the game and 13-for-31 from 3-point range (41.9 percent). Charlotte (8-14) never cut the lead below eight after Dunleavy's late 3-pointer. QUOTABLE:  "It was kind of an ugly game. We grinded it out. We didn't shoot particularly well, but we made it happen."   -- Pacers' Danny Granger THE STAT:  Pacers forward  James Posey 's statistics didn't leap from the box score Friday, but what statistics the 11-year veteran had were critical. His nine points came on 3-for-6 shooting from 3-point range and he also had four rebounds. He also continued to be the leader in what Granger said is becoming a team-wide competition for the team lead in charges taken. Posey entered the game with a team-high 12, and Pacers coach  Jim O'Brien  said he had at least four Friday. "The chargers he takes are back-breakers for the other team," O'Brien said. TURNING POINT:  The Pacers never trailed after the first quarter and aside from a Bobcats mini rally midway through the fourth quarter, it never felt as if they were in real danger of losing. But when Wallace tipped in a rebound of his own miss, Charlotte trailed just 66-64 with a little more than seven minutes remaining in the third quarter. Indiana outscored Charlotte 13-5 the rest of the quarter to take a 10-point lead entering the fourth quarter, a margin the Pacers maintained most of the period.  Josh McRoberts  and Dunleavy hit back-to-back 3-pointers during the stretch for Indiana. Charlotte never cut the lead below five in the fourth quarter. QUOTABLE II:  "We are not a .500 team. We are bad."    -- Bobcats coach  Larry Brown HOT:  Bobcats center  Nazr Mohammed  shot 5-for-6 from the field and finished with 13 points and five blocks. NOT:  Charlotte forward  Stephen Jackson  started the game hot and kept the Bobcats close early with 12 first-quarter points on 6-for-9 shooting from the field. He shot just 1-for-8 thereafter, finishing with 15 points. "I got cold in the second half," Jackson said. "I couldn't hit a shot." FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Rush continues to be a major reason for the Pacers' early-season improvement. The third-year veteran forward has been inconsistent his first two NBA seasons, but he has emerged as a reliable scorer this season, and on Friday, he helped the Pacers take control of the game's momentum in the first three quarters. He had all 16 of his points entering the fourth period and had shot 6-for-10 from the field at that point to help Indiana to a 79-69 lead. He finished with 16 points on 6-for-13 shooting from the field. He is averaging 16.6 points in the last five games and has shot 17-for-29 from 3-point range during the span. NOTABLE:  Bobcats sixth man  Tyrus Thomas  missed the game after sustaining a left quadriceps injury against Denver this past Tuesday. . . . The Pacers moved above .500 at home for the first time since starting the season 2-1. They are now 6-5 and have on three of four home games. . . . Pacers point guard  Darren Collison  tied a season high with seven assists. . . . Bobcats center  Kwame Brown  had 12 rebounds, the first time this season he has had more than 10 in a game. . . . Indiana is 7-1 this season when it has 10 or more 3-pointers. . . . Pacers center  Roy Hibbert  had 14 rebounds, including a season-high 12 on the defensive end. He also had six assists and three blocked shots. UP NEXT:  For the Bobcats, Saturday vs. Boston, Tuesday vs. Toronto, Wednesday @ Memphis. For the Pacers, Saturday @ Atlanta, Monday @ Chicago, Wednesday vs. Lakers.
