 THE FACT:  The Trail Blazers tied the franchise record by making 21 3-pointers and became the first NBA team to have two games with 20 or more treys in a season. 
 
 THE LEAD:   Wesley Matthews  and  Damian Lillard  combined for 49 points as Portland dismantled Charlotte 134-104 Thursday night at the Moda Center. 
    Matthews (25 points) and Lillard (24) were the catalysts for the Blazers (26-7), who were 21-for-33 from beyond the arc. 
   Portland's starting backcourt combined to make 17-for-24 shots from the field and 11-for-12 on 3-point attempts. The Blazers' third guard  Mo Williams  came off the bench for 15 points and 10 assists. 
 
 Chris Douglas-Roberts  came off the bench to lead Charlotte (14-20) with 20 points while  Al Jefferson  added 19. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I'm not going to lie to you. I felt 'on' when I woke up from my nap today."  
 -- Wesley Matthews 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Portland shot a season best .581 from the field, including .636 from 3-point range. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Blazers established momentum early, using a 24-4 run to bolt ahead 33-13. Charlotte never got closer than 17 points the rest of the way. 
 
 HOT:  Portland made 11 of its first 13 shots from the field and was 7-for-8 from 3-point range in the first quarter. 
 
 NOT:   Kemba Walker , who came into the game leading the Bobcats in scoring at 18.5 points a game, was 2-for-10 from the field and scored only six points. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:   "We came out sluggish. [Portland] is too good to come out sluggish. We weren't ready to play. They hit [more than] 20 3's, and that was the game."  
 -- Chris Douglas-Roberts 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Portland knew Charlotte was focusing its defense on slowing down  LaMarcus Aldridge . That meant there was room to maneuver beyond the 3-point arc. The Blazers took full advantage.   
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Bobcats never adjusted their defense to attempt to throttle Portland's game from downtown. The Blazers just kept bombing away with little resistance. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "I like being part of history. I think that's pretty cool. It's good to do something that's never been done before."  
 -- Portland coach  Terry Stotts  on the Blazers becoming the first team to make at least 20 3-point shots twice in a season 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Portland came within two of matching the NBA record for 3-point makes of 23 co-held by Orlando (2005) and Houston (2013). ...  Portland matched its season-high score for the first quarter (39 points) and reached a season high for any half (70 in the first half). ... The Blazers have the best record in the Western Conference and lead the NBA in victories. ... It was the second-highest scoring total of the season for Portland, which beat Philadelphia 139-105 on Dec. 14.  
 
 NEXT:  For the Bobcats, Saturday @ Sacramento, Tuesday vs. Washington, Friday @ Minnesota. For the Trail Blazers, Saturday vs. Philadelphia, Tuesday @ Sacramento, Wednesday vs. Orlando.
