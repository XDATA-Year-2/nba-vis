  Nets-Mavericks notebook   By Darrin Scheid, for NBA.com Posted Thursday December 9, 2010 11:50PM THE FACTS:  The Dallas Mavericks matched a season high with 55 points in the first half and held on for their 11th consecutive victory, 102-89, against the New Jersey Nets at the American Airlines Center. Mavericks forward  Dirk Nowitzki  had his seventh double-double this season with 21 points and 10 rebounds, and backup point guard  J.J. Barea  dished out a career-high 13 assists.  Brook Lopez  had 24 points and  Kris Humphries  had 16 points and 13 rebounds for the Nets, who played three quarters without injured starter  Devin Harris . QUOTABLE:  "I thought [ Anthony ]  Morrow  shot the ball really well, but for our team to win, we have to have everybody playing good. We can't shoot 41 percent as a team and expect to beat a championship-caliber team like the Mavericks."    -- Nets coach  Avery Johnson . THE STAT:  The Dallas bench outscored New Jersey's 52-24 led by  Shawn Marion 's 18 points. Dallas was balanced from the beginning. A  Brendan Haywood  dunk with 3:10 left in the first quarter gave seven Mavericks at least one basket. Of the Dallas players who saw action to that point, only  Jason Kidd  didn't have a field goal, and he hadn't attempted any. Kidd's first points came on a buzzer-beater before halftime to put Dallas up 55-40. TURNING POINT:  Dallas opened the second half with a 7-1 run, extending a 15-point lead to 62-41 with 9:53 left. New Jersey got within five at the 2:13 mark, but a Dallas spurt to end the quarter pushed the lead back to double digits. QUOTABLE II:  "Well, give credit to the defense. That's something we've honed in on since training camp. And we're doing a great job of capitalizing on playing home games and winning home games."    -- Mavericks forward  Caron Butler . HOT:  Dallas shot 41-for-75 from the field, matching a season high at 54.7 percent. Marion and Nowitzki were 8-for-10 each and Butler was 7-for-11. NOT:  Both teams combined to go 8-for-32 from the 3-point line. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Harris sprained his left shoulder in the first quarter and missed the remainder of the game. Harris fell to the floor trying to knock away an alley-oop pass. Harris entered the game as New Jersey's second-leading scorer at 17.1 points. ... Humphries had his fifth double-double of the season with 16 points and 13 rebounds. ... Morrow was 8-for-17 from the field and 2-for-4 from the 3-point line for 21 points. ROOKIE WATCH:  In the first start of his career, Nets forward  Damion James  scored four points in 23 minutes. He had one assist and three turnovers. NOTABLE:  Barea's career-high 13 assists was only his second double-digit assist night of his career. His previous high was 12 in November 2009. Barea scored four of his six points during an 8-2 run early in the fourth quarter to thwart a New Jersey comeback attempt and pushed the Mavericks lead from eight points to 87-73 with 9:50 left. Barea got assist No. 10 on a no-look pass to Marion for a wide-open dunk. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Saturday vs. Jazz, Monday vs. Bucks, Wednesday vs. Blazers.
