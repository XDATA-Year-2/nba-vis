  Trail Blazers-Mavericks notebook   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday January 5, 2011 12:05AM THE FACTS:  With another late surge sparked by  Jason Terry , the resilient Dallas Mavericks overcame the absences of  Dirk Nowitzki  and  Caron Butler  and another big homecoming by Dallas native  LaMarcus Aldridge  to earn an 84-81 victory against visiting Portland on Tuesday. Terry scored 12 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter.  DeShawn Stevenson  scored 18 and  Tyson Chandler  tallied 14 points and 13 rebounds for the Mavs. Aldridge (28 points, 10 rebounds) and  Marcus Camby  (10 points, 20 boards) turned in double-doubles for the Trail Blazers. QUOTABLE:  "He was huge for us and I was happy for him to get his rhythm back. When he makes shots like that, we're deadly. It was great to see him in the fourth quarter back to his usual self."   -- Tyson Chandler on Jason Terry THE STAT:  The Mavericks improved to 7-0 this season when Terry scores 10-plus points during the fourth quarter. TURNING POINT:  After falling behind 77-72, Dallas used a 12-4 run over the final 4:08 to win for the 19th time in its last 23 games. Terry, taking the lead with Nowitzki (sprained right knee) missing his fifth straight game and Butler (right knee surgery) out for the season, scored seven points in the run. QUOTABLE II:  "Defensively, we've been a top team in the league all year long and we can't let up now because we're missing two of our main pieces. We have to really, really concentrate on defense now. We shut them down in the half-court defense in the final quarter, so that was big."   --  Jason Terry HOT:  Chandler made his first six field-goal attempts and finished 7-for-9 as the Mavericks improved to 6-0 when he registers a double-double. In his last eight games, the Dallas center is shooting a scorching 85.4 percent (35-for-41) from the field. ... Aldridge had 35 points (20 in the fourth quarter) and 10 rebounds in his last visit to Dallas, a 103-98 loss on Dec. 15. NOT:  Other than his banked 3-pointer with 33.9 seconds remaining in the game, Portland's  Wesley Matthews  had another tough shooting night. He was 3-for-11 against the Mavericks after going 3-for-12 in Sunday's victory against Houston. ... Dallas point guard  Jason Kidd  contributed eight points, eight assists and six rebounds, but also turned the ball over five times and shot 3-for-12 (1-for-5 on 3-pointers). FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  For the second time in his last three games, Camby pulled down 20 rebounds to match his most as a Trail Blazer (Dec. 30 vs. Utah). Working primarily against a smaller  Shawn Marion  in Nowitzki's absence, Camby also scored 10 points for his eighth double-double of the season. ... Stevenson finished 4-for-9 from 3-point range and is shooting 46.3 percent (50-for-108) from behind the arc this season. INSIDE THE ARENA:  LSU football coach  Les Miles , whose Tigers (10-2) take on Texas A&M (9-3) in the Cotton Bowl on Friday night at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, was in attendance. NOTABLE:  Nowitzki missed his fifth consecutive game and remains day-to-day. The last time the perennial All-Star missed more than five games during a season was in 2001-02, when he played 76 of 82 games. ... The Trail Blazers have dropped 19 of the last 22 meetings in Dallas. ... The Mavericks are 8-1 when guard  J.J. Barea  (10 points) scores in double figures. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Thursday vs. Oklahoma City, Saturday vs. Orlando, Wednesday @ Indiana. For the Trail Blazers, Wednesday @ Houston, Friday @ Minnesota, Sunday vs. Miami.
