
 Wolves-Hawks notebook   By Matt Winkeljohn, for NBA.com Posted Sunday November 14, 2010 6:14PM THE FACTS:   Al Horford  scored 28 points and  Josh Smith  added 23 as the Hawks snapped a four-game losing streak Sunday with a 111-105 win over visiting Minnesota, the last team they beat before their skid.  Michael Beasley  scored 25 for Minnesota, giving him 102 points over his past three games (34.0 ppg), and  Kevin Love  added 22 points and 17 rebounds two nights after going 31-31 in a win over the Knicks. Minnesota's two-game win streak ended. QUOTABLE:  "It was important; it doesn't matter who we played, we had to stop the bleeding. Losing four games in a row isn't fun." --  Jamal Crawford  on snapping a four-game losing streak THE STAT:  Minnesota entered the game leading the NBA in total rebounding percentage (54.0), but the Hawks held a 40-39 edge on the boards. TURNING POINT:  In the first 4:03 of the game, Love scored eight points as the Wolves took a 17-7 lead, but over the final 43:51, Love scored 14.  QUOTABLE II:  "We have to continue to be a blue-collar team that has a mentality of securing the rebound and going back the other way."  -- Hawks coach  Larry Drew   HOT:  Beasley has scored 42, 35 and 25 points in the past three games on 43-for-76 shooting (56.6 percent). . . . Love's averaging 18.2 rebounds over the past six games with efforts of 12, 16, 9, 24, 31 and 17.  NOT:  Atlanta's  Mike Bibby  shot just 1-for-4 , leaving him 2-for-9 over the past two games with six total points in that time.  Josh Smith  committed nine turnovers over the past two games, including five Sunday. ROOKIE WATCH:  Minnesota forward  Wes Johnson  scored 10 points, and after making 4 of 8 shots he has made 15 of 25 over the past three games, averaging 12.3 points in that span. He entered the game fourth in the NBA in scoring among rookies (10.8). NOTABLE:  Minnesota guard  Luke Ridnour  missed his fourth straight game with a strained left hamstring, and will be re-evaluated Tuesday. With Ridnour out,  Sebastian Telfair  has had eight assists in each of Minnesota's last two games. He added 18 points Sunday after going scoreless Friday against the Knicks ... With five of his 10 rebounds coming on the defensive end, Smith moved past  John Drew  and into seventh place in franchise history in that category with 2,557.  Kevin Willis  is atop the franchise chart with 4,717. UP NEXT:  For the Wolves, Monday @ Bobcats, Wednesday vs. Clippers, Friday vs. Lakers. For the Hawks, Tuesday @ Pacers, Saturday vs. Mavericks, Nov. 22 (Monday) vs. Celtics.
