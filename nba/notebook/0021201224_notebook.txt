 THE FACTS: Darren Collison  scored 25 points off the bench Wednesday as the Dallas Mavericks avoided their first losing season since 1999-2000 with a 99-87 victory against the New Orleans Hornets at the American Airlines Center.  Dirk Nowitzki  added 16 points and nine rebounds and  Shawn Marion  had 15 points for Dallas (41-41). 
 All five starters scored in double figures for the Hornets in their final game before taking flight as the Pelicans in 2013-14.  Al-Farouq Aminu  led New Orleans (27-55) with 16 points and a career-high 20 rebounds and  Robin Lopez  tallied 14 points and 13 boards. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I thought we would be a playoff team. I felt like we could do something special, but when Dirk missed like 20-some games, that obviously didn't go our way." 
 
 -- Collison, who was 10-for-15 with four assists, two steals and a block. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Dallas won relatively easily despite the Hornets setting season highs for offensive rebounds (25) and total rebounds (58). They outscored the Mavericks 27-9 in second-chance points. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  After New Orleans cut the Mavericks' lead to 77-71 with nine minutes left, Marion made back-to-back buckets to spark an 18-4 run. The Hornets missed eight straight shots during that stretch. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We had a lot of turnovers. It's not really how we wanted to end the season. They really pushed the ball and we let them get to the paint too much." 
 
 -- Lopez 
 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "[Owner  Mark] Cuban  and [GM]  Donnie [Nelson]  have got some work to do this summer to get us back to where we want to be and where we should be." 
 
 -- Marion, who added seven rebounds, three assists and two steals. 
 
 
 HOT:  Aminu grabbed 13 rebounds in the first eight minutes of the game and finished with 14 in the first quarter, six more than the entire Mavericks team. He had 17 boards by halftime. His previous career high was 16. 
 
 NOT:  New Orleans shot 37 percent and turned the ball over 21 times, leading to 26 Dallas points. Eric Gordon was 4-for-17 with four turnovers. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  Before the game, Nowitzki greeted the crowd on Fan Appreciation Night. "Thanks for the all support throughout the whole year. We hope to see you next year," he said. It was the 473rd consecutive regular-season sellout at the AAC, the longest active streak in the NBA. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:   Brian Roberts  started his fifth game in place of injured guard  Greivis Vasquez  (right ankle) and finished with 13 points on 5-for-17 shooting with six assists. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Lopez was the only player to start and play in every game for New Orleans this season, just the ninth player in franchise history to accomplish the feat and first since Emeka Okafor in 2009-10. ...  O.J. Mayo  was the only Maverick to start and appear in all 82 games. ...  Vince Carter  extended his streak to 25 straight games with at least one made 3-pointer and finished the season with 162 treys, matching his career high set with Toronto in 2000-01. ... New Orleans was 3-42 this season when trailing after the third quarter. ... Dallas improved to 21-3 when shooting 50 percent or better. ... The Mavericks took three out of four in the season series. ... Dallas had zero turnovers in the first half.
