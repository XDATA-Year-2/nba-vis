 THE FACTS: Al Horford  had 20 points and 10 rebounds for his 13th double-double of the season, and in the middle of the second quarter the Hawks broke open a tight game and went on to rout the visiting Bulls 92-75. 
 Every Atlanta starter hit double figures as  Lou Williams  had 16 points in his first start of the season for the Hawks,  Kyle Korver  added 13 against his former team,  Josh Smith  had 12 and  Jeff Teague  11 in a game that changed dramatically in the second period. 
 
 Luol Deng  (11 points) and  Joakim Noah  (10) were the only Chicago players to score in double figures, and one night after the Bulls were spectacular in beating the Knicks in New York, the visitors looked like they ran out of gas in the middle of the second period. 
 The Hawks (16-9) were miserable Friday in a 99-80 loss in Philadelphia, but they outscored Chicago 25-6 over the final 6:58 of the second quarter to take a 53-37 halftime lead. The Bulls (15-11) never drew closer than 14 points in the second half. 
 Atlanta snapped a two-game losing streak while winning for just the second time in five games, and the Bulls saw a two-game winning streak end. 
 Hawks coach  Larry Drew  moved his career record to 100-73. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "That was probably one of our most energized wins thus far. I thought our defense triggered our offense. We were energized defensively, and it carry over right to the other end." 
 -- Drew 
 
 THE STAT:  0 -- That's how many fast-break points the Bulls scored in the first half while the Hawks scored 10 on the break in one of the most obvious signs of the disparity in energy levels the teams had. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Hawks trailed 31-28 in the second quarter before going on that 25-6 run. Atlanta shot 15-for-23 in the period, and forced seven Chicago turnovers. 
 Williams, whom Drew started because, "we need to play with more energy, more up-tempo," and because  Devin Harris  missed his third straight game with a sore left foot, scored 11 points in the period while playing each guard spot at different times. Horford added 10 in the quarter. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "One night you come out and play so well and you feel great, and then the next night you come out with the wrong mindset and don't play well. When you're tired, sometimes you just have to move the ball around, and we didn't do that." 
 -- Noah 
 
 HOT:  Horford shot 9-for-12 on the way to his 13th double-double of the season. He made all five of his shots in the second period. ... Korver shot 4-for-8, and 3-for-6 on 3-pointers and grabbed six rebounds. In the past three games, he's averaging 12.3 points and 5.8 rebounds while shooting 47.8 percent from distance (11-for-23). ... 
 
 NOT:  The Bulls were outscored 61-33 in the middle two quarters, when they shot 14-for-37 (37.8 percent) as the Hawks were 25-for-42 (59.5 percent). Atlanta won 22-15 on the boards in that time. ... Deng missed all five of his shots in the third quarter. ... Noah had six turnovers. 
 
 ROOKIE REPORT:  Bulls guard  Marquis Teague  didn't play in the first half, but after he entered the game in the third quarter he was often but not always matched against his brother, Hawks point guard Jeff Teague. The younger Teague was a little wild at times, but finished with a respectable eight points and three assists. ... Atlanta rookie guards  John Jenkins  and  Mike Scott  each played more than six minutes, but neither scored. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Hawks guard Devin Harris missed his third straight game with a sore left foot. ...  DeShawn Stevenson  was in uniform for Atlanta but did not play. Drew prefers not to play the guard/forward on back-to-back days because of back issues and he played Friday in Philadelphia. ... Former world heavyweight boxing champion  Evander Holyfield  was at the game. ... Drew is the second-fastest coach in Hawks history to 100 wins. He reached the mark in his 173rd game.  Lenny Wilkens  needed 166 contests. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Bulls, Tuesday vs. Houston, Wednesday @ Indiana, Saturday vs. Washington. For the Hawks, Wednesday vs. Detroit, Friday @ Cleveland, Saturday vs. Indiana.
