  Notebook: Bucks 106, Spurs 103   By Rick Braun, for NBA.com Posted Tuesday January 10, 2012 11:20PM THE FACTS:   Stephen Jackson  had his best game by far with Milwaukee as he scored 34 points and dished out eight assists to lead the Bucks to a 106-103 victory over the San Antonio Spurs Tuesday night at the Bradley Center. QUOTABLE:  "We won. That's what we did different. And that's all that matters to me. We found a way to win; we closed the game out."   -- Stephen Jackson, whose previous bests were 18 points and five assists this season. THE STAT:  The Bucks were outshot (60 percent to 51.8) and outrebounded 35-30, but went 9-for-14 on 3-pointers while the Spurs went just 4-for-14. TURNING POINT:  The Spurs had cut a seven-point deficit to one and had the ball in the final minute when  Brandon Jennings  reached around and poked the ball away from  Tony Parker . The ball went to Jackson, who fed Jennings upcourt for a dunk that made it 106-103 with 50.1 seconds left. QUOTABLE II:  "It's the worst defensive team we've ever had. We've got a long way to go."   -- Spurs coach  Gregg Popovich , who is in his 16th season as the team's head coach. HOT:   Tim Duncan  and rookie  Kawhi Leonard  both were 9-for-12 for the Spurs. Jackson was 12-for-17 for the Bucks after entering the game at 32 percent for the season. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Jennings had his first double-double with 15 points and 11 assists. INSIDE THE ARENA:   Andy North , the 1978 and '85 U.S. Open golf champion, was in courtside seats and chatted with Bucks forward  Jon Leuer  at halftime. North lives in Madison, Wis., and is a big-time booster of the University of Wisconsin, where Leuer played last season. GOOD MOVE:  After the Spurs made 12 of their first 15 shots, Bucks coach  Scott Skiles  made four substitutions at a timeout with 3:28 left in the first quarter and the Bucks trailing, 25-18. Skiles inserted Leuer for  Ersan Ilyasova ,  Drew Gooden  for  Andrew Bogut , rookie  Tobias Harris  for  Carlos Delfino  and  Shaun Livingston  for Jennings. Over the next 10 minutes, the Spurs went 6-for-16 and the Bucks took a 44-41 lead. ROOKIE WATCH:  Leonard had season highs of 19 points and four steals as he went 9-for-12 from the field for the Spurs. NOTABLE:  Leuer, a second-round pick, appears to be nudging Ilyasova out of playing time. Leuer replaced Ilyasova with 3:28 left in the first quarter and played the rest of the half and all of the third quarter before Ilyasova saw the court again. Leuer logged 29:43 at power forward, posting 10 points and five rebounds. Ilyasova played the other 18:17, posting seven points and four rebounds. ... Spurs backup point guard  T.J. Ford  left late in the first quarter with a pulled left hamstring and did not return. He had to be helped from the court and was putting almost no weight on the leg. ...  Manu Ginobili  (broken hand) missed his fifth straight game for the Spurs, while  Mike Dunleavy  (groin pain) missed his sixth straight game and  Luc Richard Mbah a Moute  (right knee tendinitis) missed his fourth straight game for the Bucks. UP NEXT:  For the Spurs, Wednesday vs. Houston, Friday vs. Portland, Sunday vs. Phoenix. For the Bucks, Thursday vs. Detroit, Friday @ Dallas, Monday @ Philadelphia.
