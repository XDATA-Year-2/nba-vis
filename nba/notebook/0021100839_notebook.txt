  Notebook: Spurs 114, Jazz 104 Posted Sunday April 8, 2012 10:42PM By Tim Price, for NBA.com THE FACTS: Tony Parker  scored 28 points, including all 10 tries from the foul line, and  Manu Ginobili  went for 23 points with 14-of-15 free throws as the San Antonio Spurs won their 11th-straight game with a 114-104 decision over the Utah Jazz on Sunday at AT&T Center. The West-leading Spurs (40-14) matched the league's longest win streak of the season -- San Antonio also won 11 in a row from Jan. 30-Feb. 20 -- and shot better than 50 percent for the third-straight home game (50.7 percent). Utah (29-28) got double-doubles from  Al Jefferson  (19 points, 10 rebounds) and  Derrick Favors  (14 and 12), but dropped to 1 1/2 games behind Denver for the final playoff spot. QUOTABLE:  "(Parker and  Tim Duncan ) have been on the same page for a long time. That's the key why we're now No. 1 in the West. Tony has been unbelievable the whole season. TD in the last 30 games has been playing great, so it's about time for me to join in. I'm starting to feel better."   --  Ginobili. THE STAT I:  Parker, Ginobili and Duncan scored 23 of the final 25 points for the Spurs. Duncan had a double-double for the night (13 points, 16 rebounds). THE STAT II:  The Spurs easily surpassed a season-high for free-throw attempts, hitting 38-of-43 tries for 88 percent. The Jazz faltered at the line, hitting 16-of-26, and even though they put up 24 more shots from the floor (93 to 69) they still lost. TURNING POINT:  The Spurs led by as much as 19 points in the first half, but Utah cut it to single digits when Favors scored inside the paint to make it 93-84 with 8 1/2 minutes left. The Spurs responded with a 10-2 run over the next the next three minutes. Utah was 4-of-11 from the foul line in the fourth quarter. QUOTABLE II:  "We had a chance, and the free throws cost us a little bit in a tight ball game. We pulled to about seven or eight points (behind the Spurs) then we missed four or five in a row. That hurts you."   --  Jazz head coach  Tyrone Corbin. HOT:  You have to go back 10 games to find when Ginobili had missed a free throw. But he only took 12 free throws in that stretch. He missed tonight, but he went 14-of-15. That's the most free-throw attempts for him this season the next highest being eight on opening night. NOT: Paul Millsap  went 1-of-8 from the floor until finally being sat down on the bench for the entire fourth quarter. Favors was 7-of-10 from the floor, including 4-of-5 in the fourth quarter in place of Millsap. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Ginobili scored 23 points and had five rebounds. It's his first time to hit the 20-point mark since March 28. It's only his third time in 20 points in the last 14 games. GOOD MOVE: Boris Diaw  was inserted into the starting lineup for the first time since the contract buyout in Charlotte cleared him to come to the Spurs. He hit 4-of-5 shots for nine points, but he took a hit by engaging in Utah's physical play. He fouled out, the first disqualification for the Spurs this season. BAD MOVE:  When the Jazz lost  Earl Watson  to right knee soreness in the first half, it forced Utah to spend most of the rest of the game using  Devin Harris  to guard Parker. It was a glaring mismatch late when Parker drove in for two layups in the final two minutes after the Jazz had cut the Spurs' lead to eight points. ROOKIE WATCH: Kawhi Leonard  hit 3-of-4 shots for six points, had four rebounds, a block and a steal in 26 1/2 minutes.  Alec Burks  was 1-of-5 and had three turnovers.  Enes Kanter  played 10 minutes and had three fouls. NOTABLE:  Besides Watson, Utah had to sit  C.J. Miles  in the first half after he sustained a left calf strain. ...There were three technical fouls in the game ( Gregg Popovich , Millsap, Duncan), all for arguing calls. ...  Jamaal Tinsley  was called for a clear-path foul in the fourth quarter when he shoved Parker from the side as Parker was beginning to head down the court with a steal. ... These teams play again Monday in Utah, and the Spurs will be going for a series sweep, having won all three meetings so far this season. UP NEXT:  For the Jazz, Monday vs. San Antonio, Wednesday @ Houston, Friday @ New Orleans. For the Spurs, Monday @ Utah, Wednesday vs. Lakers, Thursday vs. Memphis.
