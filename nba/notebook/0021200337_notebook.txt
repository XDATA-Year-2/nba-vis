 THE FACTS : Maybe it's time to stop being surprised by Golden State.  
 
 David Lee  had 20 points and 11 rebounds in his seventh straight 20-point/10-rebound game, and the Warriors had season highs in points and assists (32) as the most surprising team in the West whipped the most surprising team in the East with a 115-93 win over the host Hawks Saturday night.  
 Golden State (16-8) swept the Hawks (14-7), who had won 11 of 13 since losing 92-88 to the Warriors in Oakland on Nov. 14. Rookie  Harrison Barnes  had 19 points,  Stephen Curry  added 18 points and 11 assists and the bench pitched in, too.  Carl Landry  had 19 points and seven rebounds, and  Jarrett Jack  added 13 points and eight assists. 
 This game was tied at 26 after a quarter, but Golden State opened the second period with a 16-5 run as Barnes scored 10 of his 19 points, and the Warriors looked nothing like a squad that lost 102-94 a night earlier in Orlando while the Hawks were idle. 
 Golden State led 62-49 at halftime against an Atlanta team that entered the game with the NBA's fifth-stingiest defense, allowing an average of 93 points per game. 
 The Warriors shot 8-for-12 from 3-point territory over the first two quarters with Jack going 3-for-4 on trey tries and fellow guard Curry going 3-for-5. 
 
 Al Horford , who missed the Hawks' loss at Golden State, led Atlanta with 17 points and nine rebounds, but all other Atlanta players combined to shoot 24-for-73 (32.9 percent). The Hawks were just 5-for-26 (19.2 percent) on 3-point shots.  
 
 Josh Smith  missed his first nine shots and finished 1-for-12, as Atlanta dropped its third straight game to Golden State. The Hawks' shooting percentage (36.9) was a season low.  
 
 QUOTABLE : "I've got an all-time great group of guys. Even my young guys are old guys . . . It was important for us to bounce back tonight and show everyone that we're in this for the long run.  . . . I told [players] before the game that I'm tired, so I know they're tired. But that's no excuse. I'm proud of my guys once again because we could have used the excuse of being tired. I'm extremely happy about being part of this group." 
 -- Warriors coach  Mark Jackson 
 
 
 THE STAT :  +18 -- The Warriors made 18 more shots than the Hawks in going 49-for-99 from the field to Atlanta's 31-for-84. That more than offset the Hawks' 19-point edge from the free-throw line. Golden State did it by doing a much better job rebounding Atlanta's missed shots than did the Hawks. The Warriors had 44 defensive rebounds on the Hawks' 53 missed shots. ... Saturday completed the most successful road trip of seven or more games since the Warriors moved from Philadelphia to the West Coast in 1962. In a 6-1 blitz of the East, Lee had at least 20 points and at least 10 rebounds in every game for Golden State, which won six games on a road trip for the first time since the East-West move. 
 
 TURNING POINT : The game swung for good over the first half of the second quarter. The Hawks opened the period with one starter in shooting guard  Kyle Korver  and the Warriors had three (Barnes, Curry and  Klay Thompson ) on the floor.  
 Horford had nine points in the first quarter, but by the time he re-entered for Atlanta in the second, Golden State had seconds earlier pushed the lead to 42-31 on Lee's 17-foot jumper with 6:29 left.  
 
 QUOTABLE II : "We played so well the first five games, and then didn't show up last night in Orlando. So to come out on the road, back-to-back, when you're tired and then play this well is big for us. Being on the road this long together definitely brings us closer together." 
 -- Warriors guard Stephen Curry 
 
 HOT : Lee was 10-for-14, and remains the only player in the league averaging at least 19 points, 11 rebounds and three assists (19.3, 11.4, 3.4). He had four assists Saturday.  
 
 NOT : Curry was 2-for-10 in the second half and missed all six of his 3-point shots after halftime. ... Atlanta players other than Horford and  Ivan Johnson  shot 17-for-63 (27 percent).  
 
 QUOTABLE III : "When they punched us in the mouth, we did not respond. That was very disappointing." 
 -- Hawks coach  Larry Drew 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE :  Drew benched Smith about four minutes into the third quarter, at which point Smith was 1-for-12 with three turnovers, in favor of Johnson. 
 
 ROOKIE REPORT : Barnes took advantage of his matchup against  Korver in the second quarter, when he scored 10 with a combination of athletic moves in the post a few jumpers from afar. ... Atlanta guards  Mike Scott  (nine points, three rebounds in 9:41) and  John Jenkins  (eight points, two rebounds in 16:58) each scored career highs as they saw their most extensive time once Drew began emptying his bench by the middle of the third quarter. ... Warriors reserve forward  Draymond Green  was just 2-for-8 with five points, but he added eight rebounds, two steals, an assist and a blocked shot. 
 
 NOTABLE :  The Warriors have played 15 road games and just nine home games. They are 10-2 against teams from the East (6-1 on the road) and 6-6 against the West. Since starting 3-4, they have gone 13-4. ... Golden State learned shortly before the game that  Andris Biedrins  would make his first start at center because rookie  Festus Ezeli  was a late scratch because was bothered by a knee that he bruised a night earlier in Orlando.  Biedrins did not score, but grabbed seven rebounds in 14 minutes. ...  Anthony Morrow  did not dress for the Hawks because of a sore back. ... The Warriors are 2-2 with  Andrew Bogut  (out with a balky left ankle) starting at center, 13-6 with Ezeli starting at center, and 1-0 with Biedrins. Jackson has not made any other changes to his starting lineup as Curry and Thompson have started all 24 games in the backcourt, and Lee and Barnes have started every game at the forward spots. ... The Hawks have been among the NBA's best teams at forcing turnovers, but Golden State did not turn the ball over in the third quarter and had just 11 in the game.  
 
 UP NEXT : For the Warriors, Tuesday vs. Hornets, Wednesday @ Kings, Friday vs. Bobcats. For the Hawks, Tuesday @ Wizards, Wednesday vs. Thunder, Friday at 76ers.
