 THE FACTS:  The San Antonio Spurs overcame a 13-point deficit to start the fourth quarter and beat the Memphis Grizzlies 99-95 in overtime. The Grizzlies led by as many as 14 points in the period.  Tony Parker  led the Spurs with 30 points on 11-20 shooting, six assists and four rebounds.  Tim Duncan  scored 27 points, grabbed 15 rebounds and handed out four assists. 
 The Grizzlies outscored the Spurs by 12 points in the third quarter to build a big lead, but uncharacteristically couldn't finish off San Antonio in the fourth.  Marc Gasol  led Memphis in scoring with 20 points and had eight rebounds.  Mike Conley  scored 18 points and dished 12 assists for the Grizzlies. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Playing in the half court doesn't work real well against [the Grizzlies]." -- Spurs head coach  Gregg Popovich. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Spurs 5-9 from the 3-point line in the fourth quarter to erase Memphis' 13 point lead. The Spurs hit two 3-pointers in all other periods. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Spurs bench went on an 8-0 run in the fourth quarter when the Grizzlies had a 14-point advantage.  Patty Mills  hit a 3-pointer, then stole a rebound from  Quincy Pondexter  and laid the ball in to cut the lead to five points. On the next possession,  Matt Bonner  hit a 3-pointer to bring the Spurs within six points. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It was very much like a playoff atmosphere. It always is in this matchup and we knew it was going to be a tough game." -- Grizzlies point guard   Conley. 
 
 HOT:  Duncan made the most of his extra rest, scoring 21 points on 9-12 shooting in the first half against Memphis and pulling down eight rebounds. 
 
 NOT: Zach Randolph  was a monster on the boards again for Memphis, grabbing 15 on the night, but the Grizzly big man shot just 5-21 on the evening for 17 points. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Parker had 30 points, six assists and four rebounds for the Spurs. Duncan had 27 and 15 with four assists and a blocked shot.  Gary Neal  his three 3-pointers en route to 13 points and five rebounds. Randolph's 17 points and 15 rebounds, Conley's 18 points and 12 assists and  Rudy Gay's  15 points and 10 rebounds all highlight solid fantasy nights for Memphis. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH: Nando De Colo  had four rebounds and one assist in almost six minutes of action for the Spurs. The Grizzlies'  Tony Wroten  is currently on a D-League assignment. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Memphis shot 4-25 in the fourth quarter against the Spurs. San Antonio outscored Memphis 10-0 on the fast break in the period. The Spurs'  Danny Green  left the game in the third quarter with tightness in his hamstring.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Grizzlies, Tuesday vs. Phoenix, Friday @ New Orleans, Saturday vs. Atlanta. For the Spurs, Wednesday vs. Milwaukee, Friday vs. Houston,  Saturday @ Charlotte.
