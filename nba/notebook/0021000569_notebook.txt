  Nets-Suns notebook   By Mike Tulumello, for NBA.com Posted Thursday January 13, 2011 1:01AM THE FACTS:  The Phoenix Suns, using a four-guard lineup, frantically erased a 15-point, fourth-quarter deficit and edged the visiting New Jersey Nets 118-109 in overtime Wednesday night. The Suns (16-21), fighting to keep their playoff chances realistic, used a lineup of forward-center  Channing Frye  plus guards  Steve Nash ,  Vince Carter ,  Goran Dragic  and  Jared Dudley  to pull off the improbable comeback. Nash had 23 points, 16 assists and seven rebounds. Carter also scored 23, while Frye added 21. For the Nets (10-28),  Sasha Vujacic  hit 5-for-8 on 3-pointers to lead the Nets with 19 points off the bench. The Suns outscored the Nets 15-6 in overtime with Nash scoring 10 (including 8-for-8 on free throws). Carter made a key play, grabbing an offensive rebound (on a shot that didn't hit the rim) and scoring an instant before the shot-clock expired. That gave the Suns a 111-106 lead with 1:57 left. QUOTABLE:  "From here on out, whatever it takes to win a game, that's what we're going to do. ... We have to play like a desperate team. We  are  a desperate team."    -- Suns coach  Alvin Gentry  on Nash playing 41 minutes and his decision to go with a four-guard lineup. THE STAT:  The Suns hit 35-for-42 free throws to 17-for-22 for the Nets. TURNING POINT:  The Suns, trailing 90-75 early in the fourth quarter, went on an 18-2 run to take the lead, 93-92, and eventually force overtime. QUOTABLE II:  "We have to start playing like it means something."    -- Gentry's message to his team during a timeout, while trailing 90-75 with 10:40 left in regulation. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT: Mickael Pietrus  is out of the Suns' rotation. He has played poorly since the Suns acquired him in a big trade with the Magic last month. Grant Hill  sat out his second straight game with an ankle injury. He is expected to return Friday night at home vs. the Trail Blazers.  Josh Childress  made his second straight start in his place. Childress could stay in the rotation. Gentry announced that he will go with the same starting lineup for the next 10 games: Hill and Frye at forward,  Robin Lopez  at center and Nash and Carter at guard. If he goes with a 10-man rotation, he would have Dragic and Dudley at guard, Childress and  Hakim Warrick  at forward and  Marcin Gortat  at center. But Gentry cautioned that in addition to dropping Pietrus, he might tighten the rotation further because, "We have a lot of perimeter guys." He also said, "We want to get Hakim on the floor with Steve" because of Warrick's ability to run screen-and-rolls. So it would seem Dudley , Dragic and Warrick will play for sure off the bench. NOTABLE:  By hitting all 11 of his free throws, Nash surpassed  Mark Price  to stand as the all-time percentage leader in NBA history. For his career, Nash is 2,711-for-2,999 for a percentage of .9039679. Price was 2,135-for 2,362, a percentage of .903895. UP NEXT:  For the Nets, Friday @ Los Angeles Lakers, Saturday @ Portland , Monday @ Golden State. For the Suns, Friday vs. Trail Blazers, Monday @ New York , Wednesday @ Cleveland.
