  Suns-Rockets notebook   By Matt Miller, for NBA.com Posted Tuesday November 23, 2010 12:22AM THE FACTS:  On a night when  Steve Nash  reached another career milestone, the Phoenix Suns halted a three-game losing streak by defeating the Houston Rockets 123-116 before a crowd of 15,080 at Toyota Center. Nash, who scored 24 points and dished out a game-high nine assists, became the 16th active NBA player to reach 15,000 career points Monday when he knocked down a 17-foot jumper with 6:05 remaining in the fourth quarter. That bucket accounted for two of his 14 points in the second half. Jason Richardson  led Phoenix (7-7) with 26 points, while  Grant Hill  filled the stat sheet with 17 points, seven rebounds, and seven assists. Houston (3-10), led by  Kevin Martin's  19 points, lost its fourth consecutive game and fell to 1-4 at home this season. QUOTABLE:  "He's everything. He's the engine that drives the car. ... We have to have him on the floor." --  Suns coach  Alvin Gentry  on the importance of having Nash in the lineup. THE STAT:  The Suns shot 53.8 percent from the field, including a 7-for-13 performance from 3-point range. The sizzling shooting effort helped offset Houston's dominance in the paint (62-42) and second-chance points (24-7). TURNING POINT:  The Rockets cut a 14-point deficit down to three with less than three minutes to play, but couldn't secure the defensive rebound off a missed 3-pointer by  Jason Richardson  that would have given them a chance to tie the game with a trey on the next possession.  Hedo Turkoglu  snatched the offensive board for Phoenix and nailed a 3 to put Phoenix ahead 109-103. QUOTABLE II:  "He's a great scorer and a great shooter, but when you add in the assist total he has ... that's another 15,000 points. He's at 30,000, so he's almost catch  Kareem [Abdul-Jabar]  now." --  Gentry on Nash reaching 15,000 career points . HOT : Richardson shot 7-for-11 from the field for the game and 10-for-10 from the free-throw line in the fourth quarter. NOT:  The Rockets shot 0-for-12 from behind the arc in the first half and finished the game 6-for-26. Including Monday's performance, Houston has connected on only 30 of its last 94 3-point attempts. QUOTABLE III:  "My [strained groin] wasn't bothering me, but I somehow bruised my heel or something in the first quarter so I was limping around. ... The soreness is gone."  -- Nash on his strained groin, which kept him out of three straight games prior to Monday. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Hill has had the hot hand for the Suns of late, as he scored 17 points for the third straight game Monday. Hill actually topped the 20-point mark in the previous two games, but a 7-for-12 effort from the field Monday shouldn't scare fantasy players from utilizing him. "[Hill] has been really, really solid -- probably our most consistent player in the last 10 or 12 games," Gentry said. GOOD MOVE:  Rockets coach  Rick Adelman  started  Chuck Hay es at center instead of  Brad Miller,  but chose to go with Miller for most of the fourth quarter. Miller didn't disappoint his coach, scoring 10 of his 12 points in the final period to keep Houston within striking distance. NOTABLE:  Monday's win marked the Suns' sixth straight victory over Houston. ... Houston is 3-10 for the first time since beginning the 2005-2006 season 3-11. ... The Suns have scored 110 or more against Houston in seven straight meetings. ... Rockets forward  Jordan Hill  recorded his first career double-double, scoring 14 points and grabbing a career-high 10 rebounds. Rockets point guard  Kyle Lowry  notched a career-high six steals.
