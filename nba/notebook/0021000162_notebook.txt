  Clippers-Wolves notebook   By Tom Coyer, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday November 17, 2010 11:34PM THE FACTS:   Michael Beasley  hit the game-winning shot with 2.3 seconds remaining as the Minnesota Timberwolves beat the L.A. Clippers 113-111. Beasley, who led all scorers with 33, carried the Timberwolves to their second consecutive home win while extending the Clippers to 0-6 on the road this season. QUOTABLE:  "I'm not  Kobe Bryant  or  Dwyane Wade  so no, not at all."   -- Beasley on if he was surprised the Clippers didn't come with a double team on that final possession.  THE STAT:  The Clippers dominated the paint, scoring 62 points in the lane compared to the Timberwolves' 28. That kind of advantage in the paint is hard to overcome, but Minnesota's shooting (53.4 from the floor) was strong enough to overcome its lack of inside scoring. TURNING POINT:  The easy answer would be Beasley's game-winner with 2.3 seconds left, but the real turning point was on the Clippers possession prior to that. On that critical possession  Kevin Love  took a charge on  Al-Farouq Aminu , turning the ball back over to Minnesota for its final possession. HOT:  Over the last five games, Beasley is averaging 32.6 points while shooting 55.6 percent. NOTABLE:  Love recorded his ninth double-double of the season which ranks second in the NBA behind  Pau Gasol . Gasol and the Lakers come to Minnesota on Friday. NOTABLE II:  The Timberwolves are 4-9. Minnesota did not record its fourth win last season until December 14. UP NEXT:  For the Timberwolves Friday vs. LA Lakers, Monday @ Oklahoma City, Wednesday vs. San Antonio. For the Clippers Thursday @ Indiana, Saturday vs. New York Knicks, Monday vs New Orleans
