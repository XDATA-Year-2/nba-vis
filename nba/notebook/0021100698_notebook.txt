  Notebook: Blazers 97, Grizzlies 93 Posted Friday March 23, 2012 1:34AM By Kerry Eggers, for NBA.com THE FACTS: Wesley Matthews  and  Jamal Crawford  combined to hit six straight free throws in the final 21 seconds to cinch Portland's 97-93 victory over Memphis Thursday night at the Rose Garden. Nicolas Batum  scored 17 of his game-high 24 points for the Blazers (22-25), who also got 18 points and nine rebounds from Matthews. Marc Gasol  collected 22 points and nine boards for the Grizzlies (25-20), who lost for the fourth time in five games. QUOTABLE:  "The last two games, I didn't play aggressive. Now I have to step up. I'm the No. 2 option now. I have to do a better job. I have to play like a go-to guy almost. I just tried to be aggressive all night."    -- Batum, who had scored 18 total points in the previous games against Oklahoma City and Milwaukee. THE STAT:  Portland won the game at the 3-point and free-throw lines. The Blazers made 10 of 25 attempts from beyond the arc and were 25 of 25 from the foul line. Memphis was 3 for 8 on 3-pointers and 16 for 23 on gift shots. TURNING POINT:  Memphis led 71-66 early in the fourth quarter when the Blazers, fueled by Matthews, Crawford and Batum, went on a 15-3 run. The Grizzlies never again got even. HOT:  Memphis'  Zach Randolph  was 5 for 5 and scored 12 points in the first half. NOT:  Randolph was 0 for 5 and went scoreless in the second half. QUOTABLE II:  "We're a little dead right now ... we relax too much (on defense). It's energy and effort, our focus and our discipline. Our discipline is out the window."    -- Memphis coach  Lionel Hollins . INSIDE THE ARENA:  The crowd announced at 20,636 is the 182nd straight sellout dating to December 2007. GOOD MOVE:  The Blazers found Matthews at the 3-point line three times in the fourth quarter. He sank all three. BAD MOVE:  The Grizzlies twice fouled Crawford in the game's closing seconds. Crawford -- third in the NBA in free-throw percentage at .915 -- calmly swished four in a row from the line. QUOTABLE III:  "We came to defend for 48 minutes. We were what we needed to be tonight. We played with resolve. We executed. We got the ball to the people we wanted to get the ball to down the stretch."    -- Portland interim head coach  Kaleb Canales . NOTABLE:  It was only the fourth win in the last 11 home games for Portland, now 15-8 at the Rose Garden. UP NEXT:  For the Blazers, at L.A. Lakers Friday, Golden State Sunday, Oklahoma City Tuesday. For the Grizzlies, at L.A. Clippers Saturday, at L.A. Lakers Sunday, Minnesota Tuesday.
