 THE FACTS:   Damien Wilkins  and  Jrue Holiday  each scored 18 points and  Spencer Hawes  continued his torrid play with 15 points and a career-high 17 rebounds as the Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 100-92 on Wednesday night.  Dorell Wright  and  Thaddeus Young  each scored 14 points and  Evan Turner  added 13 for the Sixers, who improved to 28-43 and avoided a four-game sweep by the Bucks this season. 
 
 Monta Ellis  led the Bucks with 29 points,  Larry Sanders  scored 15 points while  Ersan Ilyasova  had 13 points and 18 rebounds. The Bucks have lost four in a row, falling to 34-36. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It's a great feeling. We were locked in and communicating. We're focused on winning." 
 -- Young 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Sixers outshot Milwaukee 47.2 percent to 41.6 percent and improved to 25-8 when outshooting the opposition this season. Over the past 11 games, the Sixers are shooting 47.3 percent. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Trailing 83-76 early in the fourth, the Sixers responded in a big way. They eventually reversed the trend and went ahead 98-87 with a 15-0 run in the middle. It was more than enough to pull away from the Bucks. 
 
 HOT:  Young was 7-for-12 and Hawes was 7-for-14. 
 
 NOT:  Ilyasova missed 12 of his 17 shots and J.J. Redick was 2-for-12 for the Bucks. Brandon Jennings was virtually invisible, going scoreless (0-for-3) in 17:16. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We did a great job on Jennings. He never got started." 
 -- Sixers coach  Doug Collins 
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Hawes had 15 points, 17 rebounds and four assists in 35:06. It was his fifth double-double over the past seven games. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The crowd of 16,640 was rather lively for this late season matchup at the Wells Fargo Center. When the Sixers made a late run in the fourth quarter, the fans came alive in a big way. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "You can point to a lot of things. We've got to bounce back and get a win." 
 -- Bucks forward  Mike Dunleavy 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Hawes is playing at an extremely high level and the Sixers continue to run much of their offense through him. The plan worked against the Bucks. Hawes knocked down clutch shots, was physical in the low post and made all the right passes. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Bucks coach  Jim Boylan  sat Jennings for most of the game. Jennings has played very well against the Sixers all season. This was a curious decision. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Bucks forward  John Henson  received a DNP-CD. For the Sixers, forward  Arnett Moultrie  had four points and three rebounds in 6:27. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Sixers have won four of their last five at home, including three straight, after dropping four of their previous five. ... Hawes is averaging 14.7 points on 53.8 percent shooting and 10.2 rebounds over the past 14 games. ... Jennings didn't play past the 9:37 mark of the third quarter. It's the first time he's gone scoreless in his career. Over the past three games, Jennings is averaging 5.3 points on 5-for-33 shooting. ... Over the past 12 games, Wilkins is averaging 13.9 points on 53.7 percent shooting. ... The Sixers reached the 100-point plateau, marking the third time getting there over the past four games. Over the past 15 games, the Sixers are averaging 96.7 points. ... Bucks forward  Luc Mbah a Moute  returned after missing the past eight games with a sprained toe. He didn't start but was effective in 13:33, scoring seven points on 3-for-3 shooting. ... All five Sixers starters scored in double figures. ... The Bucks were 6-for-24 from beyond the arc. Ellis was 2-for-9 and Redick was 1-for-6. 
 
 NEXT:  For the Bucks, Thursday vs. L.A. Lakers, Saturday vs. Oklahoma City, Monday vs. Charlotte. For the Sixers, Friday @ Cleveland, Saturday vs. Charlotte, Wednesday @ Charlotte.
