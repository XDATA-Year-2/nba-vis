  Notebook: Pistons 116, Cavaliers 77 Posted Tuesday April 17, 2012 11:09PM By Dana Gauruder, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  Rookie guard  Brandon Knight  scored a career-high 28 points, including 19 in the third quarter, and added seven assists as the Detroit Pistons rolled to a 116-77 victory over the depleted Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday at The Palace. Center  Greg Monroe  added his 29th double-double this season with 12 points and 13 rebounds for the Pistons, who led 100-50 after three quarters. Reserve guard  Manny Harris  led the Cavaliers with 18 points. QUOTABLE:  "The game is slowing down for him. It takes a little time to get all the way acclimated to the NBA game. He's getting to the point where he's real comfortable and the game is slower. The first few months in the league, everything is moving at 100 miles an hour. Now, everything is slowing down for him and that's what you're seeing right now."   -- Monroe on Knight's progress THE STAT:  39. The margin of victory was the Pistons' largest since Dec. 31, 2007, when they defeated Milwaukee by 45, 114-69. Detroit's biggest margin of victory this season prior to Tuesday was 24 against Charlotte on April 12. Until the Cavaliers outscored the Pistons 27-16 in the fourth quarter, Detroit threatened to collect its first 50-point victory since it defeated Boston 118-66 on Jan. 31, 2003. The 39-point loss tied Cleveland's most lopsided defeat this season; it also lost by 39, 114-75, to Chicago on Jan. 20. TURNING POINT:  This one got away from the Cavaliers in the opening minutes. The Pistons went on a 16-3 run to take an 18-5 lead, sparked by power forward  Jason Maxiell 's steal against Cavs guard  Anthony Parker , which he turned into a fast-break dunk. Maxiell had another dunk while forward  Tayshaun Prince  scored six of his 15 points. QUOTABLE II:  "It means nothing, really. You enjoy it while you can but we have a game (Wednesday) against the Hawks and it really means nothing to be up 50. We want to continue to look at what we did well tonight and make sure it translates over to tomorrow when we play a playoff team."   -- Knight on Detroit's huge lead HOT:  Knight has scored at least 23 points in three of four games against the Cavaliers this season. He is finishing the season with a flurry, averaging 21.8 points and 7.3 assists over the last four games. That has boosted his season averages to 13.0 points and 3.8 assists. Knight was 8-for-9 during his third-quarter outburst, including three 3-pointers. NOT:  Cavs veteran forward  Antawn Jamison  had one of the worst nights of his career, missing all 10 of his field-goal attempts while making four turnovers. Jamison's plus-minus rating of minus-47 was the worst in the NBA this season. ROOKIE WATCH:  Cleveland's  Tristan Thompson  recorded his eighth double-double with 12 points and 13 rebounds. He's playing out of position at center because of injuries. NOTABLE:  Cleveland's star rookie, point guard  Kyrie Irving , could return to action against Philadelphia on Wednesday after participating in Tuesday's shootaround. He has missed nine consecutive games with a sprained right shoulder. "We'll see how he feels (Wednesday) morning," coach  Byron Scott  said. "He's pretty close." ... Cavs forward  Alonzo Gee  was a late scratch with a sprained left ankle.  Omri Casspi  had 11 points while replacing him in the lineup. ... Detroit's 60-percent shooting was a season high. ... Pistons reserve forward  Jonas Jerebko  had 14 points. UP NEXT:  For the Cavaliers, Wednesday vs. Philadelphia, Friday vs. New York, Sunday @ San Antonio. For the Pistons, Wednesday @ Atlanta, Thursday vs. Minnesota, Sunday vs. Toronto.
