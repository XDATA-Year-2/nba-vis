
 Knicks-Timberwolves notebook   By Tom Coyer, for NBA.com  Posted Saturday November 13, 2010 1:21AM THE FACTS:   Kevin Love  took the Minnesota Timberwolves on his back in the second half as they overcame a 21 point third quarter deficit to beat the New York Knicks 103-112 in Minneapolis tonight. Love dominated the second half and finished the game with the NBA's first 30-30 night since  Moses Malone  last pulled off the rare statistical feat in 1982. Love finished the night with 31 points and 31 rebounds. QUOTABLE:  "K-Love just whispered in my ear and said, 'I'm going for 30 tonight.' I was like 30 what? I didn't know he had 18 at the time."   --  Michael Beasley  telling us what Love told him on the bench in the third quarter THE STAT:  31 points, 31 rebounds and five assists are the stats of the night. TURNING POINT:  With 7:10 remaining the Timberwolves held a one point lead 91-92. A missed Micheal Beasley shot was rebounded by Kevin Love and put back in to start a 14-3 run that the Knicks could not recover from. QUOTABLE II:  "You know what I'll be Robin since Batman is the assassin and Robin does all the intangibles."   -- Love  referring to his "partner in crime",  Beasley  when asked who is Batman and who is Robin QUOTABLE III  - "My dad always said if you can't get close enough to the basket throw it up there and get the rebound like Moses Malone."   --   Love  when he was told that the last 30-30 was Moses Malone in 1982 HOT:  Love was the story of the night but Beasley continues his hot scoring streak. After scoring 42 at Sacramento on Wednesday Beasley recorded 35 tonight. NO T: The Knicks in the third quarter. After shooting 46.9% in the first half, New York shot just 27.9% in the second half allowing Minnesota to erase what was once a 21 lead. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Love is on fantasy rosters for his rebounding. He grabbed 15 boards in the third quarter along tonight finishing with a career high 31. NOTABLE:  The Timberwolves have won back-to-back games for the first time since February. The Knicks are currently on a 4-game losing streak. UP NEXT:  For the Timberwolves Sunday @ Atlanta, Monday @ Charlotte, Wednesday vs. LA Clippers. For the Knicks Sunday vs. Houston, Monday @ Denver, Wednesday @ Sacramento
