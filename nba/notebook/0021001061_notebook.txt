  Jazz-Thunder notebook   By Randy Renner, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday March 23, 2011 11:26PM THE FACTS:  The Oklahoma City Thunder used a big second half (56 points) to cruise past the Utah Jazz 106-94 inside a sold-out Oklahoma City Arena. Thunder point guard  Russell Westbrook  (31) and forward  Kevin Durant  (29) combined for 60 points to lead the Thunder. OKC forward  Serge Ibaka  had a double-double with 15 points and 13 rebounds. He also had four blocks.  Utah center  Al Jefferson  led the Jazz with 32 points and a dozen boards.  Paul Millsap  added 18. The Thunder took the season series from the Jazz 3-1. QUOTABLE:  "It's good to get a nice bounce-back win. They're a very physical team. We knew they would play with desperation and I thought we matched their physical play."  --  Thunder head coach  Scott Brooks. THE STAT:  Westbrook (11-for-17) and Durant (7-for-12) combined to go 18-for-29 (62.1 percent) TURNING POINT:  The Thunder and Jazz were tied at 61 with just over four minutes left in the third quarter when Oklahoma City went on a 17-8 run to take a nine point lead into the fourth quarter. Durant hit two straight 3-pointers to push the lead out to 16 points midway through the fourth and Oklahoma City wasn't threatened after that. QUOTABLE II:  "Kevin (Durant) had not been shooting the ball well lately but he was very efficient tonight. I thought he really had a good rhythm going."  --  Brooks. HOT:  In the first 9:35 of the game Utah was 4-for-5 (80 percent) on 3-pointers. NOT:  For the rest of the game Jazz players were just 2-for-11 (18 percent) from long range. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Another sell-out crowd (18,203) inside Oklahoma City Arena. Only six games have not sold-out and the Thunder is averaging just more than 99 percent capacity. GOOD MOVE:  Oklahoma City's offense was a bit stagnant to start the third quarter. Then Russell Westbrook droves around  Earl Watson  and splits a double team to score. BAD MOVE:  Utah's Paul Millsap tries to drive along the baseline but he bounces the ball off his foot and out of bounds. NOTABLE:  Jazz forward  Andrei Kirilenko  left the game late in the second quarter with a bruised nerve in his left knee and did not return to the game. Oklahoma City is now 10-2 in March and 14-5 on Wednesday nights. The Jazz fall to 4-7 in March. UP NEXT:  For the Jazz, Thursday vs Hornets, Saturday vs Mavericks, Monday vs Wizards. For the Thunder, Friday vs Timberwolves, Sunday vs Trail Blazers, Tuesday vs Warriors.
