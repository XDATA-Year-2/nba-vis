 THE FACTS:  After letting the short-handed Cleveland Cavaliers have their fun in the first quarter, the Chicago Bulls put the locks on and eventually cruised to a 118-92 victory Monday at the United Center. The Bulls have now won 11 straight games against the Cavaliers. Chicago's  Carlos Boozer  had 24 points with 11 rebounds while  Joakim Noah  had a double-double with 11 points and 11 rebounds.  Luol Deng  had a great all-around game with 19 points, five rebounds, seven assists and four steals. Cleveland was led by  Dion Waiters  with 18 points.    
 
 THE FACTS II:  The Cavaliers ran out to a 30-20 lead in the first quarter, getting nine points each from  C.J. Miles  and  Kyrie Irving , who made three 3-pointers between them to spark the team. Down 32-22 early in the second quarter, the Bulls scored 11 straight points to erase the deficit and make it a game. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "When we are right, we are a tough team to beat. We have some of the toughest guys in the league on our team."  
 -- Bulls forward  Taj Gibson   
 
 
 
THE STAT : The Bulls shot 71 percent from 3-point range, making 10 of 14 attempts. Bench contributors  Marco Belinell i and  Nate Robinso n each made three of four attempts from long range. 
 
 THE STAT II:  The Bulls committed 20 turnovers in the game but the Cavaliers could only convert them into 12 points. The Bulls converted 16 Cleveland turnovers into 23 points.  
 
 THE STAT III:  The Cavaliers scored 30 points in the first quarter and 62 in the final three quarters.   
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Bulls led 70-64 with 6:45 left in the third quarter then outscored the Cavaliers 18-8 the rest of the quarter to expand the lead to 16. 
 
 INJURY UPDATE:  Cavaliers center  Anderson Varejao  is projected to be able to play Wednesday against the Hawks after missing 10 games with a knee contusion. Cavaliers guard  Daniel Gibson  missed his fifth straight game due to a concussion.  Luke Walton  did not play Monday for personal reasons.   
 
 HOT:  Backup power forward Taj Gibson, perhaps following the lead of starting power forward Carlos Boozer, was 8-for-9 from the field and had seven rebounds.  
 
 NOT:  Cleveland center  Tyler Zeller  was 2-for-8 for six points and had a pair of consecutive shots blocked in the second quarter.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "They have a way of taking you out of the game at times."  
 -- Cleveland coach  Byron Scott 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Bulls coach  Tom Thibodeau  kept his starters' minutes down, limiting league leader Deng to just 38 minutes and Noah to 32. Backups Robinson and Belinelli played more minutes than starters  Kirk Hinrich  and  Rip Hamilton .    
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA: Luc Longley , the starting center for the Bulls' three championship teams in 1996, 1997 and 1998, was in attendance. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Waiters has had back-to-back 18-point games for Cleveland.   
 
 NOTABLE:  The Bulls had a season high with 118 points. Their previous high was 115 against Cleveland in the second game of the season. ... The Bulls' last eight wins against Cleveland have been by double digits.
