  Rockets-Suns notebook   By Mike Tulumello, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday March 9, 2011 12:57AM THE FACTS: Hakim Warrick  picked the perfect night to have his biggest game for the Phoenix Suns. Warrick, beginning his stint in place of the injured  Channing Frye , poured in a career-high 32 points as the Suns fought off the visiting Houston Rockets 113-110 Tuesday night. The Suns are trying to replace an unconventional starting power forward in Frye, who has made more 3-pointers than any NBA player (304) since the start of the 2009-10 season. "I'm not a 3-point shooter, but I can shoot the 15-footer, the 20-footer," Warrick said. "If I can make that shot, it opens up the lane." Also for the Suns (33-29),  Vince Carter  scored 32 points on 13-for-17 shooting. Marcin Gortat  had 13 points and 16 boards. This increased his NBA-leading double-doubles off the bench to 13 (the most by a Suns' reserve since  Maurice Lucas  had 15 in 1984-85). Kyle Lowry  had a brilliant game for the Rockets (33-33). Lowry scored 13 of the Rockets' first 22 points, then -- at the game's finish -- scored 10 of their final 12. His totals: 11-for-18 (including 7-for-11 on 3-pointers) for 32 points. With potential playoff spots on the line, both teams played with a frenzied effort down to the final seconds. Lowry hit a pair of 3-pointers, including a 30-footer with 14 seconds left, to cut the lead to 112-110.  Steve Nash  hit only 1-for-2 from the line, giving the Rockets one last chance. But  Brad Miller 's 3-pointer over Nash missed, and the Suns had the win. Luis Scola , who had never missed an NBA game, sat out with a sore knee. His consecutive game streak ended at 311. Because the Rockets don't play again until Saturday, they're hoping this will be just a one-game miss. The Suns moved to within 1 1/2 games of the Memphis Grizzlies for the final playoff spot. They have won 13 of their last 18 and are 18-8 since Jan. 12. QUOTABLE:  "1-0 without Channing."    -- written on chalkboard in Suns' locker room after game THE STAT:  The Rockets'  Kevin Martin , guarded by  Grant Hill , shot just 5-for-16. TURNING POINT:  With the Suns leading 99-98 with 3:30 left, the Suns went on a 7-2 run. Carter hit a 20-footer, 1-for-2 on free throws, then hit an 18-footer. After a timeout, Warrick closed the run on a spectacular alley-oop dunk off an inbound pass from Nash. That gave Suns a 106-100 lead with 1:30 left.     QUOTABLE II:  "I'll say it again, and I'm going to keep saying it until somebody hears it or somebody writes it: If Grant Hill is not on the all-defensive team, then I don't know who should be. I really don't. Every night, we ask him to guard the best player ... unless it's a 'five' (center)."    -- Suns coach  Alvin Gentry GOOD MOVE:  In the absence of Scola, Rockets coach  Rick Adelman  gave extended time to  Patrick Patterson , who came through with 9-for-12 shooting for 18 points in 28 minutes. BAD MOVE:  The Suns'  Mickael Pietrus  drew two technical fouls and an ejection arguing a blocking/charging call even though the Suns already were missing Frye. "I was a little disappointed in that," Gentry said of Pietrus' antics. "We're a little short-handed." FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Frye will be out for 2-3 weeks. This will give more playing time to Warrick and perhaps to Pietrus. In addition,  Josh Childress , who rarely plays, could work his way into the rotation. Childress had two points and one rebound in four minutes vs. the Rockets. NOTABLE: Goran Dragic  and  Aaron Brooks , the two backup point guards who were traded for each other last month, shot a combined 0-for-10, though Dragic was 6-for-8 from the line. Coming into the game, Brooks was averaging 8.8 points on 55 percent shooting plus 3.6 assists for the Suns. Dragic was averaging 7.8 points on 45 percent shooting plus 2.4 assists for the Rockets. UP NEXT:  For the Rockets, Saturday vs. San Antonio, Monday vs. Phoenix, Wednesday vs. Charlotte. For the Suns, Thursday vs. Milwaukee, Sunday vs. Orlando, Monday @ Houston
