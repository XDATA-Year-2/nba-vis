  Notebook: Mavericks 99, Raptors 86   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Friday December 30, 2011 11:43PM THE FACTS:  The defending NBA champion Mavericks finally broke into the win column Friday, at the expense of one of the men who helped them capture the title.  Ian Mahinmi  scored 19 points and  Dirk Nowitzki  added 18 for Dallas in a 99-86 victory against Toronto and first-year head coach  Dwane Casey , an assistant for the Mavericks for the past three seasons.  Andrea Bargnani  scored 30 points and  Leandro Barbosa  had 20 for the visiting Raptors. QUOTABLE:  "If I'm open, I'm going to shoot it. That's what coach has been telling me throughout the preseason. When I got an open shot, I got to take it, which is something I've really worked on in the offseason."   -- Ian Mahinmi THE STAT:  The Mavericks' bench outscored the Raptors by a whopping 56-26 margin. In addition to Mahinmi's effort, reserves  Jason Terry  (17) and  Vince Carter  (10) also scored in double figures. TURNING POINT:  After the Raptors had used a 14-0 run to take a 68-61 lead with 3:56 left in the third quarter, Mavericks head coach  Rick Carlisle  called a 20-second timeout. He subbed Carter in for  Shawn Marion  and Carter immediately ended the drought with a 3-pointer, followed by a step-back 14-foot jumper. That sparked a 16-2 spurt by the Mavericks to finish the period. HOT:  During the first half, Bargnani led all scorers with 18 points on 7-for-8 shooting. It was his 13th career 30-point game and first this season. NOT:  Mavericks forward  Lamar Odom  is still struggling with his shot. He was 0-for-3 against Toronto and is shooting 13.3 percent (4-for-30) through four games. Odom is 1-for-12 from 3-point range. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Mahinmi's previous career high was 17 points in a loss at Memphis on Jan. 15, 2011. The Mavericks' backup center was 6-for-6 from the field and 7-for-11 at the line with five boards, two blocks and one steal in nearly 29 minutes of action. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Members of the Penn State and University of Houston football teams, in town for Monday's TicketCity Bowl at the Cotton Bowl, attended the game. NOTABLE:  Raptors guard  Jerryd Bayless  suffered a sprained left ankle early in the second quarter and did not return. He finished with two points and two turnovers in 6:59. ... Mavericks point guard  Jason Kidd  played in his 1,271st career game, moving past  John Havlicek  into sole possession of 17th place on the NBA's all-time list. ... Dallas improved to 13-3 all-time at home against Toronto. ... In the third quarter, the Mavs were 10-for-15 at the foul line and the Raptors did not attempt a free throw. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Sunday @ Minnesota, Monday vs. Oklahoma City, Wednesday vs. Phoenix. For the Raptors, Sunday @ Orlando, Monday @ New York, Wednesday vs. Cleveland.
