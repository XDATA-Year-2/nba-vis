  Notebook: Mavericks 93, Suns 87   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Tuesday January 24, 2012 1:18AM THE FACTS: Shawn Marion  gave Phoenix fans flashbacks with a vintage "Matrix" performance on Monday, sinking four 3-pointers and scoring a season-high 29 points to fuel the Mavericks' 93-87 victory over his former team in Dallas. Marion, who ranks fourth in Suns history with 652 3-point field goals from 1999-2008, made only three treys in his first year with Dallas in 2009-10, five in 2010-11 and five this season entering the game. It was his 33rd career game with four or more 3-pointers, but his first since leaving Phoenix four years ago (Jan. 18, 2008 vs. Minnesota). The Mavericks, playing without  Dirk Nowitzki  because of a sprained right knee, got another boost from the bench with 17 points, nine rebounds and three blocks from  Ian Mahinmi  and 12 points from  Jason Terry .  Marcin Gortat  paced Phoenix with 19 points and 17 rebounds for his eighth straight double-double. QUOTABLE:  "I've shot the three my whole career -- I just don't have to do it here. Here I don't have to do it because they need somebody who can score inside the paint. ... When you stop doing it, it definitely feels a little weird, though."   -- Marion, who matched his highest point total as a Maverick, set on March 8, 2010 vs. Minnesota THE STAT:  The Mavericks have held 15 consecutive opponents under 100 points, extending a franchise record. The previous mark was 13 straight from Jan. 14-Feb. 9, 2006. Teams have averaged just 84.3 points against Dallas during that span. TURNING POINT:  Phoenix whittled what had been a 15-point deficit down to seven with less than nine minutes left. Dallas pushed the lead back to 84-74 with a free throw and a tomahawk dunk by Mahinmi, then  Sebastian Telfair  was ejected for a flagrant foul when he clubbed  Rodrigue Beaubois  with a forearm to the head on a layup attempt. Beaubois hit both free throws, the Mavericks maintained possession and got a 15-foot jumper from  Lamar Odom  to make it 88-74 with 6:53 left. QUOTABLE II:  "We did a poor job with the turnovers. We didn't shoot the ball well. We didn't deserve to win. We didn't play well enough to win."   -- Phoenix coach  Alvin Gentry HOT:  This was the Mavericks' seventh straight win at home this season and their seventh straight win against the Suns. NOT:  Phoenix shot a season-worst 37.3 percent from the field, including 35.0 percent (14-for-40) in the second half. The Suns turned it over 19 times, leading to 21 Dallas points. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT: Steve Nash  had a game-high 12 assists and  Grant Hill  flirted with a dubious triple-double, finishing with a season-high 19 points, eight boards and eight turnovers. ...  Brendan Haywood  scored a season-high 10 points for Dallas. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Cowboys legend  Emmitt Smith , the NFL's all-time rushing leader, received a big ovation from the crowd. ... R&B singer  Monica , who is married to Phoenix guard  Shannon Brown  (14 points), sat with  Khloe Kardashian , who is married to Odom (11 points, five assists). ROOKIE WATCH:  Forward  Markieff Morris  made his third straight start for Phoenix and finished with seven points and a season-high 11 rebounds. NOTABLE:  Odom and Suns guard  Jared Dudley  both appeared in their 200th consecutive games, tied for the fifth-longest active streak in the NBA. ... Phoenix is 6-0 when leading at halftime and 0-10 when trailing at the break. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Wednesday vs. Minnesota, Friday vs. Utah, Sunday vs. San Antonio. For the Suns, Tuesday vs. Toronto, Friday @ Portland, Saturday vs. Memphis.
