 THE FACTS :  Gerald Henderson  and  Kemba Walker  each scored 34 points as the Charlotte Bobcats rallied from a 19-point deficit for a 114-108 victory over the Orlando Magic Wednesday night at Time Warner Cable Arena.  Tobias Harris  scored a career-best 29 points for the Magic, who have dropped eight straight and 30 of its last 34 games.  
 
 QUOTABLE : "It's was one of those things, we felt we could attack them out there. Kemba and I did that. We pushed the ball and put pressure on them. It worked out well for us tonight. We've got a young team. We bring a great attitude and play hard every night and things worked out in our favor tonight." 
 -- Charlotte guard Gerald Henderson  
 
 THE STAT : Charlotte (17-54) shot better than 50 percent from the floor for just the third time this season. The Bobcats were 44-of-85 (51.8 percent) on the night. The team is now 3-0 when that happens and 2-26 when allowing the opposition to shoot 50 percent or better from the floor.  
 
 TURNING POINT : Jump ball. Charlotte hit the boards hard on the offensive glass and it paid off with a jump ball situation between  Bismack Biyombo  and Harris late in the fourth quarter. Biyombo won the jump ball and the Bobcats took a four-point lead 110-106 shortly after on a Henderson 18-foot jumper.  
 
 HOT : Henderson shot 12-for-18 and connected on 9-for-10 from the charity stripe Wednesday. Henderson also added seven rebounds on the night. He combined with Walker for 18 points in the fourth quarter and didn't miss a shot in the final period. Henderson is averaging 23.0 points over the last five games.  He's scored 20 or more six times in the last 10 games.  
 
 NOT : The Magic bench combined for just 12 points on 4-for-10 shooting and accounted for three of Orlando's 10 turnovers. The combined bench played a total of just over 35 minutes. Their bench is averaging 17.0 points over the last three games. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT : Walker was hitting on all cylinders Wednesday against Orlando. The Bobcats guard netted 34 points, dished nine assists, grabbed seven rebounds and had two steals and two blocked shots. Over his last three games, Walker is averaging 29.7 points, 5.0 assists and 5.0 rebounds. For the four-game seasons series, he averaged 28.8 points, 7.0 assists and 5.3 rebounds.  
 
 ROOKIE WATCH :  Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  had six points and six rebounds in 20 minutes of action for the Bobcats. Orlando's rookies got plenty of action Wednesday in Charlotte.  Maurice Harkless  had 18 points and four rebounds, while  DeQuan Jones  added 13 points. However,  Kyle O'Quinn  stole the show for the Magic. The Norfolk State product had a career night with 23 points while grabbing 11 rebounds and dishing out six assists.  
 
 NOTABLE : Charlotte won the season series for the first time since the 2004-05 season. ... Six of Charlotte's wins have come against the Wizards and Magic this season as the team is 3-1 against both. ... With Henderson and Walker scoring 34 points apiece, the Bobcats had two players score 30 points or more in a game for just the third time in franchise history. ... The 19-point deficit overcome by Charlotte was the largest this season and third largest in franchise history. ...  Jameer Nelson  has five double-doubles in his last 12 games and 14 on the season. ... Harris had career marks in points (29), assists (6) and minutes played (45) in the loss.
