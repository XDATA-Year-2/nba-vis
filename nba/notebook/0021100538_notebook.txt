  Notebook: Lakers 115, Kings 107 Posted Saturday March 3, 2012 2:17AM By Melanie Neff, for NBA.com THE FACTS: Kobe Bryant  had 38 points and eight rebounds and  Andrew Bynum  added 19 points and 15 rebounds to lead the Lakers to a 115-107 victory over the Sacramento Kings Friday night at the Staples Center. Four Lakers starters finished in double figures with  Metta World Peace  and  Pau Gasol  each adding 15 points. It was the second consecutive game the Lakers topped the 100-point mark. They have now won 8 of their last 11 games to improve to 22-14 overall and 16-2 at home. The Kings made a game of it late, thanks in large part to  Jimmer Fredette , who scored all 12 of his points in the fourth quarter. Fredette hit a three-pointer with five minutes remaining to pull the Kings within five at 100-95, but World Peace and Bryant followed with three-pointers of their own to help put the game out of reach. Francisco Garcia  led the Kings off the bench with 18 points.  Marcus Thornton  added 15 points, and  Isaiah Thomas  and  Tyreke Evans  each had 14.  DeMarcus Cousins  staked claimed to his 23rd double-double of the season with 10 points and 13 rebounds. The Kings fall to 12-24 overall and 4-18 on the road. QUOTABLE:  "I did the best I could to help my team win. I'm just trying to be a good player and get out there and give a spark."  --  Fredette on his fourth quarter performance. THE STAT:  The Kings bench shot 61 percent from the field in the fourth quarter, outscoring the Lakers starters, 33-23. TURNING POINT:  After Fredette pulled the Kings to within five with five minutes left in the game, World Peace and Bryant answered with five consecutive points each to give the Lakers a 110-97 lead with two minutes remaining. HOT:  Bryant and Bynum. After suffering a broken nose, concussion and strained neck over the weekend, Bryant has scored 31 and 38 points since coming back, despite having to wear a protective mask. Bynum, who missed the Lakers first matchup with the Kings, recorded his second consecutive double-double and his second straight three-block night. NOT:  Kings  Jason Thompson  shot 1-8 from the field. GOOD MOVE:  Kings head coach  Keith Smart  opted to go with his bench for all but 28 seconds of the fourth quarter after watching his starters get outscored 27-16 in the third quarter, while shooting a dismal 21 percent from the field. The Lakers held a 92-74 lead at the end of the third. BAD MOVE:  Smart opted to go with his bench for all but 28 seconds of the fourth quarter. NOTABLE:  With the win, the Lakers moved into a first-place tie in the Pacific Division with the Los Angeles Clippers, who fell to the Phoenix Suns. UP NEXT:  For the Lakers, Sunday vs. Miami, Tuesday @ Detroit, Wednesday @ Washington. For the Kings, Sunday @ Phoenix, Monday @ Denver, Wednesday vs. New Orleans.
