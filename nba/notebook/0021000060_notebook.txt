
 Mavericks-Nuggets notebook   By Michael Kelly, for NBA.com Posted Thursday November 4, 2010 12:16AM THE FACTS:   Dirk Nowitzki  scored 35 points and grabbed 12 rebounds and the Dallas Mavericks held on to beat the Denver Nuggets 102-101 Wednesday night.  Carmelo Anthony  missed a 22-foot jumper with 2.1 seconds left that would have won it for Denver. QUOTABLE:  "I think I hit that shot nine out of 10 times. It's a heartbreaker."   -- Anthony THE STAT:  With starting center  Nene  in street clothes because of a groin strain, the Nuggets had no regular rotation player taller than 6-foot-9. That led to several mismatches, including 7-foot Nowitzki being guarded by 6-foot-3  Chauncey Billups  in the low block. TURNING POINT:  Tied at 99,  Caron Butler  hit a 3-pointer from the corner with 1:59 left to give the Mavericks the lead for good. QUOTABLE II:  "It comes down to one possession either way. You walk out of here feeling great or terrible."   -- Rick Carlisle HOT:   Jason Terry  hit four 3-pointers and scored 16 of his 20 points in the third quarter to help the Mavericks grab the lead. NOT:  Nuggets guard  J.R. Smith  continues to struggle from the field. He was hitting 35 percent from the field coming into Wednesday and went 2-for-8 against the Mavericks. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Anthony had 20 points, three under his season average, but he grabbed 15 rebounds while playing power forward most of the game. ROOKIE WATCH:  Nuggets forward  Gary Forbes  was thrust into the starting lineup when Nene was scratched before tipoff. He scored 12 points, all in the first half, to help Denver build a 52-50 lead at the break. NOTABLE:  The Nuggets had won 11 of the previous 15 games between the teams, including the postseason, before Wednesday's loss. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Saturday vs. Denver, Tuesday vs. Boston, Wednesday @ Memphis. For the Nuggets, Friday vs. the L.A. Clippers, Saturday at Dallas, Monday at Chicago.
