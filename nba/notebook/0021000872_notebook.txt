  Nuggets-Blazers notebook   By Kerry Eggers, for NBA.com Posted Saturday February 26, 2011 2:27AM THE FACTS:   LaMarcus Aldridge  collected 24 points and 14 rebounds -- including the game-winning free throws with 23.1 seconds left in overtime -- to lift Portland past Denver 107-106 Friday night at the Rose Garden. The Blazers (33-25) moved into a virtual tie with the Nuggets (34-26) for sixth place in the Western Conference playoff race. QUOTABLE:  "It was a big shot, the play of the game. He hit some big shots down the stretch. He played within himself. He played more minutes than he's supposed to, but he toughed it out. It's his game ball."    -- Portland's  Andre Miller  on teammate  Brandon Roy , who scored 18 points in 24 minutes offf the bench, including a 3-pointer with 5.8 seconds lefft in the fourth quarter that forced overtime. THE STAT:  The Blazers shot .435 from the field (40-for-92) and .435 on 3-point attempts (10-for-23). TURNING POINT:  Portland trailed 94-88 late in regulation, but Roy knocked down a pair of 3-pointers in the final 40 seconds to push the game into overtime QUOTABLE II:  "We made a lot of big shots; they just made probably one more. My thing is, we probably got better tonight more than we did last night [an 89-75 win over Boston], and that's exciting. You don't like losing, but as much as last night was a great win, tonight was a good loss."    -- Denver coach  George Karl . HOT:  Roy scored 10 of his points in the fourth quarter, going 3-for-3 from the field, 2-for-2 from 3-point range and 2-for-2 from the foul line. NOT:  Denver's point guards,  Ty Lawson  and  Raymond Felton , combined to make 5-for-20 shots. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Denver's  Danilo Gallinari  scored 30 points -- one shy of his career high -- and gathered nine rebounds in his third game as a Nugget. INSIDE THE ARENA:  As fan sometimes gets to shoot from halfcourt for the opportunity to win an automobile as an in-house promotion during a timeout. Portland's  James Collier , 23, threw up a left-handed baseball toss that swished through the net. He won a 2011 Toyota Tundra for his efforts. GOOD MOVE:  Portland coach  Nate McMillan  has Roy -- in his second game back following arthroscopic surgery on both knees on Jan. 17 -- on a 15-minute-per-game limit. But the Blazers had only nine players dressed, so Roy's minutes got bumped up to 24. He was needed. BAD MOVE:  Lawson drove for what would have been the winning basket at the end of regulation, but his shot hit the bottom of the rim as the horn sounded. ROOKIE WATCH:  With the Blazer front line depleted, seldom-used forward  Luke Babbitt  saw eight minutes of action. He was scoreless with two rebounds and four personal fouls. NOTABLE:  Aldridge notched his 28th double-double of the season. He is averaging 26.3 points on .534 shooting and 10.0 rebounds since Dec. 15.
