  Notebook: Wizards 104, Heat 70 Posted Friday April 27, 2012 12:28AM By Rich Dubroff, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  The Miami Heat rested  LeBron James ,  Dwayne Wade  and  Chris Bosh  for the second straight game and were blown out by the Washington Wizards 104-70 on Thursday night. Mo Evans  had a season-high 18 points,  Nene  and  Kevin Seraphin  had 15 and  John Wall  had seven points and 12 assists for Washington, which won its sixth straight game. It's their longest winning streak since Nov. 2007. The Wizards led by 10 after the first quarter, 25 at halftime and by 30 after three. They led by as many as 38 in the fourth quarter.  Norris Cole  led Miami with 14 points. QUOTABLE:  "If we land safely and the plane touches down in Miami, it's a victory. That was a nasty game. Luckily no one was injured. Seriously, that's what you take away from this game."   -- Heat forward  Shane Battier THE STAT:  Miami had 22 turnovers and Washington scored 33 points off them. TURNING POINT:  The Wizards outscored the Heat 27-11 to take a 33-18 lead early in the second quarter. QUOTABLE II:  "I'm not an idiot. Any time you lose a job, you're disappointed. I think anybody doesn't want to lose a job or look elsewhere for a job."   -- Washington coach  Randy Wittman , who took over in January with the team 2-15, but who hasn't been guaranteed a job for next season . HOT:   Nene  was 6-for-7 from the field. In his last three games, he was 20-for-25 from the field. NOT:  Miami's  Terrel Harris  was 1-for-9 from the field in 31 minutes. GOOD MOVE:  Wall knew he was playing an overmatched team and instead of forcing his shots, he dished off the ball and had seven assists in the first quarter. BAD MOVE:  The Heat failing to put a representative team on the court.  Eddy Curry  started for the first time since March 7, 2008. NOTABLE:  It was Washington's biggest win since a 41-point victory over Seattle on Nov. 11, 2005. IN THE ARENA:  Fans were given player's jerseys after the game. The first jersey given away belonged to  Andray Blatche , who's been booed for being out of condition. The fans booed when the jersey was handed out.
