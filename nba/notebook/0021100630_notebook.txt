  Notebook: Bucks 115, Cavs 105 Posted Wednesday March 14, 2012 11:36PM By Rick Braun, for NBA.com THE FACTS:   Drew Gooden  posted his second career triple-double with 15 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds in just three quarters of action as the Milwaukee Bucks pulled away to a 115-105 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers Wednesday night at the Bradley Center. Ersan Ilyasova  added 22 points and  Mike Dunleavy  scored 21 off the bench as the Bucks (19-24) won their fourth straight and held their position in the Eastern Conference's eighth and final playoff spot. They hold a tie-breaker over the New York Knicks, who also won to go to 19-24. Rookie point guard  Kyrie Irving  led the Cavaliers (16-25) with 28 points and five assists but also committed eight turnovers. QUOTABLE:  "Some nights he's Magic and some nights he's Tragic. Tonight he was Magic, with a little Tragic sprinkled in with five turnovers."   -- Mike Dunleavy on Gooden's 13 assists that included a no-look pass THE STAT:  The Bucks posted a whopping 38 assists on 46 made field goals. That's a league high for the season. With the 32 they posted in a victory at New Jersey Monday, they have 70 in the last two games. TURNING POINT:  The Cavs managed to hang within striking distance most of the second half and were still within 102-93 after Irving's 3-point play with 5:24 left. But over the next 3:40 the Cavs failed to score thanks to two missed free throws, four turnovers and three missed shots. The resulting 9-0 run for Milwaukee made it 111-93, and that was that. QUOTABLE II:  "He was looking like a point guard tonight with the 13 assists. He was just making plays all over the place."   -- Bucks guard  Brandon Jennings  on Gooden's triple-double. HOT:  Bucks starters went 32-for-60 (53.3 percent) and the bench was just a little better at 14-for-26 (53.8 percent), led by Dunleavy's 8-for-11 performance. NOT:  Cleveland point guard  Ramon Sessions , a former Buck, went 0-for-8 from the field. INSIDE THE ARENA:   Craig Wambold  of Dousman, Wis., banked in a halfcourt shot at halftime to win a $10,000 jackpot. GOOD MOVE:  Although Gooden had his triple-double by the last minute of the third quarter, Bucks coach  Scott Skiles  rested him the entire fourth quarter as a small lineup to match the Cavaliers' small lineup pushed an 84-78 lead after three to as big as 111-93. ROOKIE WATCH:  Irving's 28-point night was impressive, but he committed half of his eight turnovers in the fourth quarter as the Bucks pulled away. NOTABLE:  The Bucks' two newest acquisitions,  Monta Ellis  and  Ekpe Udoh , were in the house and met reporters for questions in a press conference shortly before the game. Acquired from the Golden State Warriors for injured center  Andrew Bogut  and guard  Stephen Jackson , neither could play until the trade was officially completed. Coincidentally, the Bucks' next game is at Golden State Friday night. ... Bucks guard  Shaun Livingston  did not play for the third straight game because of a sprained left ankle. ... Gooden has reached double figures in assists just twice in his career. Both times he recorded a triple-double, and both came against the Cavaliers. ... Bucks forward  Luc Richard Mbah a Moute , who missed all but eight minutes of the previous five games with a sore right knee, returned to play 27 minutes, 39 seconds and record a double-double of 12 points and 13 rebounds. UP NEXT:  For the Cavaliers, Sunday vs. Atlanta, Monday @ New Jersey, Wednesday @ Atlanta. For the Bucks, Friday @ Golden State, Tuesday @ Portland, March 22 vs. Boston.
