 THE FACTS:  Jerryd Bayless  sank a pair of free throws with 1.5 seconds left to close out Memphis' 102-97 victory over Portland Tuesday night at the Rose Garden. 
 
 Zach Randolph  made a triumphant return after missing four games with a sprained ankle, collecting 19 points and 10 rebounds for the Grizzlies (42-19), who improved to 13-1 in their last 14 games.  Mike Conley  had 14 points and 15 assists and  Ed Davis  contributed 14 points and nine boards off the bench.  
 
 LaMarcus Aldridge  went for 28 points and 10 rebounds while  Damian Lillard  collected 27 points and seven assists for Portland (29-34), which lost for the third time in four games. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We played hard all night and controlled the game. We made some not-so-smart plays down the stretch, fouling guys when we shouldn't have. But we made enough free throws and made enough plays. It was a nice win against a very tough ballclub that wouldn't quit."  
 -- Memphis coach  Lionel Hollins 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Memphis shot 51 percent from the field and held a large advantage in points in the paint (52-40) and fast-break points (17-6). 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Portland drew to within 71-65 with nine minutes left, but the Grizzlies answered with an 8-2 run for a 79-67 advantage. The Blazers never quite recovered. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:   "They are physical. They play great team defense, play great individual defense. It was a struggle to score all night. We didn't shoot the ball well. Part of that was us; part of that was their good defense."  --  Portland coach  Terry Stotts 
 
 
 HOT:  Randolph and  Marc Gasol  were unerring around the basket, each sinking 8-for-13 from the field. 
 
 NOT:  Portland's  Nicolas Batum  didn't make a field goal in 41 minutes, going 0-for-5. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Memphis continued to pound the ball in to Randolph, Gasol and Davis, who combined for 53 points and 21 rebounds. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "That door is closing. We have to put some wins together fast. If we don't, that door will close on us."  
 -- LaMarcus Aldridge, on the Blazers' fleeting playoff hopes 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Lillard scored 20 points for the seventh game in a row. ... Randolph notched his 36th double-double of the season to break a tie with Portland's  J.J. Hickson  and move into second in the NBA behind Golden State's  David Lee  (42). It was the 29th double-double for Aldridge. ... Hickson was 3-for-10 from the field, ending a franchise-record streak of 25 games shooting 50 percent or better. It's the fourth longest such streak in the NBA in the last 25 years. ... Portland scored 39 points in the fourth quarter, the most points given up in a single period by Memphis all season.
