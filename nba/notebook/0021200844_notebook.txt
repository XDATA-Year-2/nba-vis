 THE FACTS:   That Indiana won its fifth consecutive game, all by double figures, was almost lost in the aftermath of a fourth-quarter shoving match that spilled into the front row of spectators at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, resulting in six technical fouls, the ejection of Pacers center  Roy Hibbert  and possible suspensions coming from the league. With  David West  scoring 28,  George Hill  23 and  Paul George  21, the Pacers weathered a 38-point storm from  Stephen Curry  and wore down the visiting Golden State Warriors 108-97 Tuesday. Indiana led 95-85 with 6:10 remaining when Hibbert responded to a hard push from Lee with a two-handed shove, sparking a scrum that started under the basket and migrated to the edge of the court before officials and cooler heads prevailed. In addition to Hibbert's ejection, Lee, West, Curry and  Klay Thompson  picked up technical fouls. There appeared to be no punches thrown but several players, including Curry, were knocked to the floor. West scored six in a row as the Pacers pushed the lead to 104-87 to put the game away. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "To tell you the truth, it was between me and David Lee. I don't know why he (Curry) came at me like that. Other guys want to run up on me, that's, I don't know. It's unfortunate. Just happy the team won."  
 
 -- Hibbert 
 
 
 THE STAT:  In their five-game winning streak, the Pacers (36-21) have outscored opponents by 119 points, an average margin of 23.8. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  After a wild second-quarter in which the Warriors had runs of 13-2 and 12-2 sandwiching an Indiana run of 20-3, not much was settled as the Pacers held a 54-53 edge at halftime. But Hibbert and West began to assert themselves in the third quarter, combining for eight points in a 13-0 run that pushed Indiana's lead to 78-64 as Golden State went nearly four minutes without a bucket. The Warriors got no closer than six the rest of the way. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We preach and talk about togetherness, so that's a part of what we're going to do. We're not going to let teams, especially in that instance, just gang up on Roy. They came at him too many times. After the first initial (when) he and Lee go at it, there's no need for those two other guys to come and put their hands on Roy. There's just no need for that."  
 
 -- West 
 
 
 HOT:  Curry was on fire, shooting 14-for-20 overall including 7-for-10 from the 3-point line, adding four assists. ... West was even hotter, going 12-for-16, while Hill was 9-for-14. 
 
 NOT:  Thompson was 5-for-14 for the Warriors, while key reserves  Jarrett Jack  and  Carl Landry  were held to a combined 5-for-20 shooting night. ...  Lance Stephenson  was 4-for-15 for the Pacers, and Indiana's bench produced just 14 points as  Danny Granger  shot 1-for-7 in his home debut. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "Indiana's a very physical team. They're one of the most physical teams if not the most physical team in the East."  
 
 -- Lee 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  In two games back after missing the first 55 with tendinosis in his left knee, Granger has shot 2-for-17, 0-for-5 from the 3-point line, and totaled seven points in 37:06. ... The Pacers paid tribute to the late  Roger Brown  with a video presentation between the first and second quarters. Brown, a direct-elect member of the Naismith Hall of Fame class of 2013 from the ABA committee, will become the third former Pacer to be enshrined in the past two years, following  Reggie Miller  and former ABA teammate  Mel Daniels  in 2012. Daniels was one of several former teammates on hand, long with  Billy Keller, Freddie Lewis, George McGinnis, Bob Netolicky, Tom Thacker  and  Jerry Harkness  ... Warriors center  Andrew Bogut  (back spasms), missed his third straight game and there is no timetable for his return.  ... George added 11 rebounds for his 18th double-double. ... Hibbert had 13 points, nine rebounds and five blocks before his ejection. ... Golden State committed 20 turnovers, six by Curry, leading to 29 Indiana points. ... Once this current stretch of four road games in five nights ends, the Warriors' schedule turns markedly. Golden State finishes with 16 of its final 22 at home, where it is 18-7. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Pacers, Thursday vs. L.A. Clippers, Friday @ Toronto, Sunday vs. Chicago. For the Warriors, Wednesday @ New York, Friday @ Boston, Saturday @ Philadelphia.
