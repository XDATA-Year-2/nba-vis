  Notebook: Hawks 109, Raptors 87 Posted Monday April 16, 2012 10:34PM By Duane Watson, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  The Atlanta Hawks (36-25) defeated the Toronto Raptors (22-40) 109-87 at the Air Canada Centre. Playing in the second half of a home-and-home, the Hawks made up for a home defeat on Sunday to the Raptors losing 102-86 and clinched a playoff spot with the win. The Hawks are fighting for home court advantage in the Eastern Conference in a fight for the fourth spot. After only leading 54-51 at the half, the Hawks outscored the Raptors 25-17 in the third, with the Raptors shooting 7-for-22 (.318) from the field in the quarter. The Hawks continued the pace in the fourth, taking a 24-point lead in the quarter and making up for their own embarrassing loss the night before.  Ivan Johnson 's career-high 21 points and eight rebounds off the bench led the Hawks, while  Jeff Teague  added 19 points and 10 assists.  Joe Johnson  had 18 points and  Marvin Williams  contributed 16 off the bench. The Raptors were paced by  DeMar DeRozan 's 22 points and  James Johnson 's 18 points, had their two-game win streak snapped and fell to 12-20 at home. QUOTABLE:  "We was better than what we played last night, we just stepped it up more. It happens, it's the NBA where amazing happens."   -- Hawks forward Ivan Johnson THE STAT:  Fast break points were 28-5 in favor of the Hawks. Their ability to capitalize on the Raptors 19 turnovers and put the ball into motion was a big difference.  TURNING POINT:  The third quarter opened the game up for Atlanta with the Raptors shooting 7-for-22 (.318) from the field and a Hawks 13-4 run near the end of the quarter. Atlanta took their biggest lead of the game at that point with 13 points, ending the quarter up 79-68 and never looked back. QUOTABLE II:  "I'm glad we was able to turn right back around and play this team again. That way we can really go ahead and get that sour taste out of of our mouths. We understand that we was the better team last night and we wanted to come out and show it and we did."   -- Hawks guard Joe Johnson HOT:  James Johnson went 6-for-7 from the floor in the first half. He finished with 15 points, three assists, one steal and a monster 3-point play dunk on  Vladimir Radmanovic . He has shot 12-for-15 with 30 points in his last three quarters. Unfortunately in the second half he was held to one basket, scoring 2 points on 1-for-4 shooting. NOT:  The Raptors point guards. With  Jose Calderon  suffering an eye injury, available only if needed  Ben Uzoh  and  Gary Forbes  shot a combined 5-for-23 with eight assists and six turnovers. Both logged heavier minutes than normal after point guard  Justin Dentmon 's 10-day contract was not renewed today. NOTABLE:  It was the Hawks' last road game of the season, as they finished 17-16 ... The Hawks win the season series (3-1) with Toronto for the fourth straight year ... The Hawks have scored 100 or more points in five of their last seven games .... Hawks guard  Willie Green  was not with the team ...  Linas Kleiza  (sore right knee) and Calderon (eye) were dressed for the Raptors but did not play .... Former Toronto Blue Jay and Hall of Fame second baseman  Roberto Alomar  was at the game ... The Hawks have won seven of eight matches against the Raptors ... The Raptors signed forward  Alan Anderson  and Uzoh for the remainder of the 2011-12 season ... Uzoh recorded career highs with 10 rebounds and eight assists ...  Solomon Alabi  recorded career highs in points (8) rebounds (9) and minutes (24) ... UP NEXT:  Toronto goes on the road on Wednesday @ Miami, @ Detroit on Sunday and @ Milwaukee on Monday. Atlanta returns home to play vs. Detroit on Wednesday, vs. Boston on Friday and vs. New York on Sunday.
