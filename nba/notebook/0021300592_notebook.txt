 THE FACT: Kevin Durant  scored a career high 54 points in leading the Thunder over the Warriors. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Durant had more made baskets (19) than the rest of the OKC starters combined (18), as Oklahoma City withstood a 3-point barrage from Golden State to win 127-121 Friday night. 
 The 127 points are the most scored this season by OKC (30-10), as Durant's 54 points led all scorers. The OKC star also had six assists and four rebounds.  Serge Ibaka  added 21 points and grabbed eight rebounds and  Reggie Jackson  scored 14 points and handed out six assists. 
 The Warriors (25-16) hit 16 3s,  Steph Curry  and  Klay Thompson  combined to hit a dozen of them. Curry led his team with 37 points and 11 assists. He was 11-for-18 shooting overall (6-for-10 on 3s) and Thompson added 26, but just five of those points came in the second half.  David Lee  and  Marreese Speights  each had 13. 
 The Thunder have now won 10 straight games against the Warriors in Oklahoma City and have never lost a season series to Golden state since the Thunder franchise moved from Seattle. Tonight's game was the last of three scheduled between the teams and OKC won the season series 2-1. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "As the leader of this team, my main objective is to serve my teammates and some nights I have to put it up." 
 -- OKC's Kevin Durant on his 19-for-28 shooting night 
 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "You can point out KD's 54 points but also just his ability to get good shots. He had a game tonight that he was just hard to contain." 
 --Thunder coach  Scott Brooks 
 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "He's a special talent, a superstar basketball player, an all-time great." 
 --Warriors coach  Mark Jackson  on Kevin Durant 
 
 
 THE STAT:  With 54 points and six assists, on 67.9 percent shooting (19-for-28), Durant becomes the first player to score at least 54 points on at least 65-percent shooting while handing out at least five assists since  Michael Jordan  did it in April 3, 1988. According to SportVU, Durant scored those 54 points on 68 touches. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Thunder led by just three points halfway through the third quarter, and then over the next six minutes OKC went on a 17-7 run to extend the lead out to 13 points. That provided enough breathing room to keep the Warriors at arm's length. 
 
 HOT:  Durant was 7-for-8 (15 points) in the first quarter and 11-for-14 (29 points) by halftime. 
 
 NOT:  The Warriors missed eight of their first 11 free-throw attempts.  Andre Iguodala  was 0-fopr-4 (0 points) in the first half and finished 1-for-8 (two points). 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The 134th consecutive sellout inside Chesapeake Energy Arena. 5-Time UFC Champion Randy Couture sat courtside along with Olympic Gold Medal wrestler Kenny Monday. Both men wrestled at Oklahoma State. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Durant has been hesitant at times to try to take over a game, instead preferring to dish to his teammates and get them involved. Tonight Durant let it fly and no one could stop him. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Brooks said before the game the Thunder would "have to guard the 3-point line" but in the first half they didn't. The Warriors were 10-for-16 (62.5 percent) from beyond the arc. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Thunder backup center  Steven Adams  played just under 11 minutes. He scored six points and pulled down five rebounds before fouling out. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Thunder's 71 points in the first half were the most they've scored in any half this season...Curry picked up his fifth 30 point, 10 assist game of the season (Leads NBA). 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Warriors, Saturday @ New Orleans, Monday vs. Indiana, Friday vs. Minnesota.  For the Thunder, Sunday vs. Sacramento, Tuesday vs. Portland, Wednesday @ San Antonio.
