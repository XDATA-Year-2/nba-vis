 THE FACTS :  For the second straight night, the Indiana Pacers needed a victory to clinch the Central Division title. For the second straight game, the Pacers came up short,  this time at the hands of  John Wall  and the Washington Wizards in his squad's 104-85 win on Saturday night. 
 Wall scored 26 of his 37 points in the first half as the Wizards (29-47) won their ninth straight home game.  Kevin Seraphin  had 15 points and  Martell Webster  added 13 as Washington defeated the Pacers (48-29) for the first time in four games this season.  
 
 Roy Hibbert  had 25 points and 10 rebounds,  Gerald Green  scored 13 and David West had 12 points and 10 rebounds for the Pacers.  
 Leading 51-48 at halftime, the Wizards opened the third quarter with a 12-0 run as Wall capped the surge with the final six. Washington maintained at least a seven-point lead from there and increased the margin to 21 in the fourth 
 
 QUOTABLE : "We're struggling to make shots. ... Look, we're a tired team. It's not an excuse, but we look like a tired team. We have to find a way to rejuvenate." 
 -- Pacers coach  Frank Vogel  after the Pacers' second lopsided defeat in as many nights 
 
 THE STAT : Indiana finished a dismal 3-for-20 on 3-point attempts after shooting 2-for-12 from beyond the arc against the Thunder. 
 
 QUOTABLE II :  "Whenever you're feeling good, playing good, you're more into the game, you're more enthused, you're more happy. That's the good thing about it when it when we're winning. it's all equal too having fun with your teammates and enjoy it." 
 -- John Wall on his outgoing performance, which included him flexing his muscles multiple times following baskets 
 
 HOT : Wall made 12 of his 15 shots in the first half, including 7 of his 8 attempts in the first quarter for 15 points. His 26 first half points topped or equaled the Wizards' high-scorer in 67 of their first 75 games. 
 
 NOT : Indiana's leading scorer on the season,  Paul George  finished 0-for-8 from the field, including four misses from 3-point range, and had two points. He scored only eight points in Friday's loss to the Thunder. 
 
 QUOTABLE III :  "We've just been sluggish. The energy factor hasn't been there, our mental focus hasn't been there. This .. .I don't know. We [have] got to find it though." 
 -- Paul George on the Pacers' lethargic performance 
 
 NOTABLE :  At halftime, the Wizards honored the 35th anniversary of the franchise's only NBA Championship team. Members of the Washington Bullets 1978 title team in attendance included Hall-of-Famers  Elvin Hayes  and  Wes Unseld . ... The win was the Wizards' first over Indiana since December 29, 2010 in Washington. ... George Hill  had 11 points for the Pacers. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Pacers, Tuesday vs. Cavaliers, Wednesday vs. Nets, Friday @ Knicks. For the Wizards, Sunday @ Celtics, Tuesday @ Knicks, Wednesday vs. Heat.
