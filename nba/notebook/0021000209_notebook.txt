  Knicks-Bobcats notebook   By Brian Joura, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday November 24, 2010 10:43PM THE FACTS:   Raymond Felton  led the Knicks with 23 points and 13 assists in his return to Charlotte as New York emerged with a 99-95 win over the Bobcats and a sweep of their home-and-home series. QUOTABLE:  "Someone needs to do a study to see how many times someone goes up 10 and then it comes back and goes even. It just happens. I'm glad that we're the ones going up and not having to fight back."  -- Knicks coach  Mike D'Antoni  on his team's recent penchant of building a double-digit lead only to have to sweat out the outcome at the end of the game. THE STAT:  New York went on a 19-6 run in a 6:18 period that spanned the first and second quarters to take the lead. The Knicks scored five 3-pointers in that span and finished the game 12-for-25 from behind the arc. It was the fourth straight game in which they made double-digit 3-point shots and the seventh time in 16 games this season they tallied 10 or more in a game. TURNING POINT:  After Charlotte went on a 28-13 run to take the lead, the Knicks held the Bobcats scoreless over the final 1:29 of the game. The Knicks did not hit a bucket in this stretch either, but hit five from the line to win. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:   Tyrus Thomas  was the big story with his 26 points and 11 rebounds.  Amar'e Stoudemire  had 20 points and six blocks, including a crucial rejection at the end of the game.  Landry Fields  grabbed 10 rebounds. THE STAT II:  The Knicks blocked 11 shots in the game. After being 29th in the league in blocked shots the past two seasons, New York entered the night leading the league with 115 blocks and an average of 7.67 blocks per game. QUOTABLE II:  "The good news is that we have a five-game winning streak. The bad news is that we're .500. Let's be real and try to get a win on Saturday." -- D'Antoni summing up the Knicks, who have their first five-game winning streak under D'Antoni and the latest they have been .500 since they were 8-8 in 2008-09. NOTABLE:   Danilo Gallinari  missed his first free throw attempt of the game, ending a streak of 43 consecutive makes from the charity stripe. Gallinari was one away from tying the franchise record of 44, set by  Chris Duhon  in the 2008-09 season. UP NEXT:  For the Knicks, Saturday vs. Hawks, Sunday @ Pistons, Tuesday vs. Nets. For the Bobcats, Friday vs. Rockets, Saturday @ Bucks, Wednesday @ Hornets.
