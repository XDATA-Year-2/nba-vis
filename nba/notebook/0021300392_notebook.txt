 THE FACT:  The Knicks dropped to 0-3 in noon home starts this season. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Former Knick  Zach Randolph  torched his old team for 25 points and 15 rebounds and  Tony Allen  added a season-best 19 points and eight boards as the Memphis Grizzlies snapped a five-game losing streak by beating the Knicks 95-87 at Madison Square Garden. 
 
 Carmelo Anthony  scored 12 of his 30 points in the fourth period, when the Knicks (8-18) outscored Memphis (11-15) 26-23.  Tim Hardaway Jr.  and  J.R. Smith  added 16 points apiece. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I'm trying to get a win, I'm always extra motivated. I love playing in the Garden. And it's a team I played for. I had a great time when I was here. So it's definitely sweet to get a win here."  
 -- Zach Randolph 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Grizzlies out-rebounded the Knicks 56-29. 
 
 THE STAT II:  Memphis outscored the Knicks 60-28 in the paint. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  After taking a 25-22 first-quarter lead, the Grizzlies outscored the Knicks 25-18 in the second to seize a 50-40 halftime lead. Allen and Randolph combined for 14 points in the second. The Knicks used a 9-0 run to get within 91-87 in the final seconds, but couldn't take the lead. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "You look at the rebounding. It was 56-29. That's embarrassing, especially when you start a big lineup.  Tyson [Chandler ],  [Andrea]  Bargnani , they gotta rebound the ball better."  
 -- Knicks coach  Mike Woodson 
 
 
 WHO'S HOT:  Allen has now gone for 16, 16 and 19 points in his last three games, with 19 serving as his season-high. His career-best is 30. 
 
 WHO'S NOT:  After re-entering the starting lineup, Bargnani went 1-for-5 for three points with two rebounds and one turnover for the Knicks. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "We couldn't keep them out of the paint, that was the problem."  
 -- Mike Woodson 
 
 
 QUOTABLE IV:  "If we just won half of our games here at home, we'd be sitting at the top of the division." 
 -- Mike Woodson 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Knicks continue to be without their top two point guards,  Raymond Felton  (strained left hamstring) and  Pablo Prigioni  (right big toe).  Kenyon Martin  (strained abdominal muscle) and  Metta World Peace  (sore left knee) are also out. 
 
 NOTABLE II:  In three noon home starts, the Knicks have now lost by a combined 80 points. They were bludgeoned by a combined 72 points by the Boston Celtics and San Antonio Spurs.  
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  John Leguizamo  sat courtside. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Knicks, Monday @ Orlando, Wednesday vs. Oklahoma City, Friday vs. Toronto. For the Grizzlies, Monday vs. Utah, Thursday @ Houston, Satuday vs. Denver.
