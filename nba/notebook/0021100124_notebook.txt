  Notebook: Trail Blazers 98, Cavaliers 78   By Kerry Eggers, for NBA.com Posted Monday January 9, 2012 12:26AM THE FACTS: LaMarcus Aldridge's  stat line included 28 points, eight rebounds, four assists and four steals in the Trail Blazers' 98-78 win over the Cavaliers Sunday night at the Rose Garden. Portland (6-2) shot only 41 percent from the field but broke away in the second half from a Cleveland team that fired at only a 37 percent clip.  Wesley Matthews  added 24 points for the Blazers. Rookie point guard  Kyrie Irving  led the Cavs (4-4) with 21 points. QUOTABLE:  "It wasn't as bad as the Phoenix game. In Phoenix, I felt like everybody was moving two steps slow. Tonight. we were just a little bit slow. Then we started playing defense and got some steals, and that opened the game up for us."   --  Portland's LaMarcus Aldridge, referring to Portland's 102-77 loss against the Suns Friday night. THE STAT:  Portland scored 28 points off 24 Cleveland turnovers. The Cavaliers got only eight points off 14 Blazer giveaways. TURNING POINT:  Portland led only 57-53 late in the third quarter when Aldridge fueled a 12-0 run with eight points -- a jump hook and six straight free throws -- to push the margin to 69-53. Cleveland never got closer than 12 points the rest of the way. QUOTABLE II:  "We have to limit fast-break points. We are No. 1 in the league, which is a credit to (the Cavaliers), but they really capitalized on our turnovers tonight."   --  Irving on the Cavs entering the game as having fewest fast-break points scored on them (6.0 per game). Portland finished with 22 fast-break points. HOT:  Aldridge, 1 for 6 in the first quarter and 3 for 10 at halftime, made 7 of 11 shots in the second half. NOT:  Cleveland was 3 for 24 from 3-point range. QUOTABLE III:  "Once we got our second wind the second half, we started to play better basketball, establish a defensive presence and were able to break this game open."   --  Portland head coach  Nate McMillan . INSIDE THE ARENA:  The Blazers notched their 164th straight sellout crowd (20,292) dating to Dec. 21, 2007. GOOD MOVE: Gerald Wallace  scored three baskets on run-outs after turnovers for the Blazers. BAD MOVE:  In this season where fatigue will be a major factor, McMillan left his reserves on the bench until the final three minutes despite a 20-point-plus lead through the fourth quarter. NOTABLE:  The Blazers shot 27 percent from the field in the first quarter, .469 over the final three periods. UP NEXT:  For the Blazers, L.A. Clippers Tuesday, Orlando Wednesday, at San Antonio Friday. For the Cavaliers, at Utah Tuesday, at Phoenix Thursday, at L.A. Lakers Friday.
