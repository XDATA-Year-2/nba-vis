  Notebook: Wolves 127, Suns 124 Posted Tuesday March 13, 2012 2:45AM By Mike Tulumello, for NBA.com     THE FACTS:  For 48 thrilling minutes, the Minnesota Timberwolves played at the Phoenix Suns' old-time, break-neck pace Monday night in Phoenix. Somehow, the slower moving Timberwolves matched the Suns, shot for shot, plus one. The T-wolves pulled out a heart-stopping 127-124 win in a game that was big for both teams. Minnesota (22-21) was coming off the devastating loss of point guard Ricky Rubio and two home losses, to the Los Angeles Lakers and the bottom-dwelling New Orleans Hornets. "It's huge," Wolves coach  Rick Adelman  said, pointing out his team is starting a marathon seven-game road trip. Kevin Love  led the Wolves with 30 points, including 5-for-9 on 3-pointers.  Nikola Pekovic  added 24 points and eight rebounds. For the Suns,  Jared Dudley  had 28 points and nine boards, while  Steve Nash  had a great game with 25 points, 10 assists and zero turnovers. The Suns, who had won seven of their past nine to pull into playoff contention, dropped to 19-22. The teams matched shot for shot down the stretch, with Love hitting a 3-pointer to give the Wolves a 119-118 lead with 2:30 left. The Suns gained the lead moments later on a 14-footer by  Grant Hill . But in the closing 1:40, Nash missed a 15-foot runner and an 18-foot jumper, Hill missed a short jumper and Dudley had a 3-pointer rim out. The Wolves made their free throws to ensure the win. In winning, Minnesota broke a nine-game losing streak to the Suns. QUOTABLE:  "The biggest thing was energy."   -- Pekovic, pointing out the Wolves lacked this quality in their home loss to the Hornets on Saturday. THE STAT: Marcin Gortat , a double-double machine for the Suns this season, didn't have it in this one. He had just eight points and four rebounds and missed two free throws with 12 seconds left and the Suns trailing 125-122, a mistake that sealed the win for the Wolves. He also had trouble staying with Pekovic. TURNING POINT:  When Love began heating up from 3-point range late in the game. The Wolves led 92-90 to start the final quarter when Love hit a pair of 3-pointers. Then with the game hanging in the balance, Love hit another 3-pointer with 2:38 left to give the Timberwolves a 119-118 lead. "We've got to get a hand in his face," lamented Suns coach  Alvin Gentry . "More important, we've got to make him a dribbler, not a catch-and-shoot guy." QUOTABLE II:  "A terrific win for our team. Both teams were shooting the heck out of the ball. We finally got them to miss a couple at the end."    -- Adelman HOT:  The Wolves were 14-for-22 on 3-pointers. NOT:  The Suns'  Markieff Morris  shot 2-for-8. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT: Robin Lopez  has been giving the Suns effective defense off the bench for weeks. Now, he's starting to score, averaging 10.5 points his last two games. ROOKIE WATCH:  Minnesota's  Derrick Williams , the quickly developing first-year forward, scored 19 off the bench, part of the Wolves' 52-35 scoring margin off the bench. NOTABLE:  The Suns'  Sebastian Telfair  scored six points in five seconds. With the T-Wolves leading 107-105, Telfair bombed home a 25-footer and was fouled by Williams. Telfair hit the free throw, so the 4-point play made it 109-107 Suns with 6:45 left. Telfair then stole the ball from  Luke Ridnour  and hit a layup with 6:40 left to make it 111-107. Telfair ended up 4-for-4 for 10 points in just eight minutes. UP NEXT:  For the Timberwolves, Thursday @ Utah, Friday @ L.A. Lakers, Sunday @ Sacramento. For the Suns, Wednesday vs. Jazz. Thursday @ L.A. Clippers, Friday vs. Pistons.
