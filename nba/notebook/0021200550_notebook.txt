 THE FACTS:  The Milwaukee Bucks (19-17) defeated the Toronto Raptors (14-23) 107-96 at the Air Canada Centre on Sunday afternoon. The Bucks have now won their eighth consecutive game against the Raptors and their third under new head coach  Jim Boylan , who is 3-1 at the helm. 
 The Bucks pulled out the win in a dogfight in the second half and were led by their backcourt of  Brandon Jennings ' 19 points and 10 assists and  Monta Ellis ' 17 points. Their bench stepped up with rookie  John Henson  scoring 19 points and  Mike Dunleavy  adding 15.  Larry Sanders  added 11 points and 8 rebounds with a key block to shift the game. 
 After jumping out to a 20-point lead in the first quarter, where  Jose Calderon  scored 15 points for the Raptors. Toronto followed up their 34-16 opening frame by shooting .278 percent from the field in the second and giving up 10 turnovers leading to 13 Milwaukee points, and letting the Bucks creep to within a basket at halftime 49-47.  
 Despite the Bucks tying the game three times Toronto was able to slightly extend their lead 78-74 at the end of the third quarter behind  DeMar DeRozan's  10 third-quarter points. The fourth quarter saw the game tied three times with three lead changes. However, Sanders the league leader in blocked shots at 3.3 per game, made a big one on DeRozan with 3:09 left, which sparked a 9-0 Bucks run, giving Milwaukee a 101-91 lead that the Raptors couldn't recover from. 
 The Raptors were led by DeRozan's 23 points, while  Amir Johnson  had a season-high 22 point and 14 rebound double-double and  Ed Davis  added his own with 20 points and 12 rebounds. Jose Calderon was the fourth Raptor with 20-plus points with 21 points and eight assists. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "He's always making big defensive stops for us, always engaging the guys, always running to get that big stop for us." 
 -- Bucks guard Jennings on Sanders defense. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  While the Raptors bench has been strong during this recent stretch, the Bucks second unit dominated this game outscoring them 43-7. The Raptors bench shot only 2-for-16 from the field. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  With a very closely contested second half, Sanders block on DeRozan made the difference with 3:09 left and sparked a 15-5 Bucks run to close out the game.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "John Is a funny player, he's a rookie and he's got 2 or 3 good plays and a couple bad plays. I don't have much hair left, but whatever it is, it's probably going to be coming out soon."  
 -- Bucks Head  Coach Boylan  on rookie  John Henson . 
 
 
 HOT:  Calderon had a remarkable first quarter shooting 6-for-7 from the field and 3-for-3 from the 3-point line for 15 points and four assists, he left the game with 4.1 seconds with a sore right calf. He did return and finished the game with 21 points and 8 assists on 9-for-15 shooting. 
 
 NOT:  After a 34-point first quarter, Toronto couldn't score a basket until Davis' lay-up with eight minutes left in the second quarter. They shot .278 percent (5-for-18) from the field, while allowing the Bucks to shoot .571 percent. In addition they turned over the ball 10 times, leading to 13 Bucks points. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Johnson re-aggravated his sore right ankle after stepping on someone's foot in the second quarter and Calderon tweaked his right calf in the first. Both went to the locker room after their injuries but returned and re-entered the game. They both had strong games as their teams needed them. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Milwaukee won its first game of a four-game road trip and is 9-8 on the road for the season. The Bucks recorded their fifth-largest comeback (20 points) by an opponent. Toronto had a streak of 121 consecutive minutes while trailing at the 10:40 mark of the third quarter. Toronto falls to 0-17 when opponents score 100-plus points.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Raptors; Tuesday @ Brooklyn, Wednesday vs Chicago, Friday @ Philadelphia. For the Bucks; Tuesday @ Lakers, Thursday @ Phoenix and Saturday @ Portland.
