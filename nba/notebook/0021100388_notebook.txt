  Notebook: Raptors 86, Celtics 74 Posted Friday February 10, 2012 10:55PM Duane Watson, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  The Toronto Raptors (9-19) defeated the Boston Celtics (14-12) 86-74 at the Air Canada Centre on Friday night. The Raptors never trailed and led by as many as 16 and snapped a 3 game losing streak.  Jose Calderon  made a key 3 point shot with 1:37 left in the game to secure the Raptors lead for good, netting him 17 points to go along with 14 assists. Boston played their second of a back-to-back, losing last night at home in overtime to the Los Angeles Lakers 88-87 and it showed. The Raptors started the game with an impressive 26-14 first quarter and never looked back. Despite the Celtics bringing it to 41-34 at halftime they had already committed 13 turnovers on 39.4 percent shooting. The Raptors  DeMar DeRozan  had a game high 21 points, while  James Johnson  contributed 14 points and  Amir Johnson  had a double-double with 12 points and 12 rebounds. For Boston,  Kevin Garnett  led the Celtics with 17 points and 8 rebounds while Paul Pierce added 12. The Raptors sorely needed this win for various reasons, notably, the last time these two teams met in Boston when they were thrashed 100-64. The win gives them their fourth home victory of the season and is the second game of a 7 game home stand. QUOTABLE:  "I thought the guys took it to heart, they had pride, they remembered how they spanked us down in Boston and bounced back from it. The resilience they showed was impressive."   -- Raptors head coach  Dwane Casey THE STAT:  The Raptors jumped on the Celtics fast and early, forcing them to commit 13 turnovers in the first half with  Rajon Rondo  committing 5 of them. Their inability to take care of the basketball made it that much more difficult to make headway in a game they were down early in. TURNING POINT:  Despite the Raptors taking a 12-point lead into the fourth quarter, the Celtics rallied to pull it to within eight points until Calderon knocked down a 3-point shot with 1:38 left to give the Raptors a 84-72 lead and keep the game out of reach. QUOTABLE II:  "We had a bad taste in our mouth, we had to get over it cause we had other tough teams on our schedule, but as soon as Boston was back on, the taste comes back. I think tonight, more people wee willing to win than to score 40."   -- Raptors forward Johnson on the last meeting with the Celtics, losing 100-64. HOT:  When it mattered  Linas Kleiza  arrived. In the fourth quarter the Raptors forward shot 3 for 6, all from behind the 3 point line for 9 points in the final frame. Kleiza is averaging 16.6 points per game over the last five off the bench for the Raptors. "He did his job, he does what he do," Casey said. NOT:  The Celtics may have felt the effects of going back-to-back after their overtime loss last night, starting flat with an uncharacteristic 6 turnovers in a 26-14 first quarter. 10 Celtic players checked into the game before the end of the frame and not one registered more than one field goal. Collectively Boston shot 30.8 percent from the field and 55.6 percent from the free throw line. ... Calderon had 0 turnovers in 37 minutes of play. NOTABLE:   DeMar DeRozan  is averaging 21.7 points over his last 3 games. ... The Raptors snapped a five game losing streak against the Celtics. ...Celtics matched their season low for first quarter scoring with 14 points. ...Toronto won wire-to-wire for the first time since Nov. 24, 2010 vs. Philadelphia (106-90). UP NEXT:  Toronto continues its home stand Sunday vs. Lakers, Tuesday vs. New York and Wednesday vs. San Antonio. The Celtics return home on Sunday to face Chicago, Wednesday vs. Detroit and Thursday @ Chicago.
