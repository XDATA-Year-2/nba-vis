  Notebook: Bucks 105, Raptors 99 Posted Sunday March 11, 2012 9:47PM By Duane Watson, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  The Milwaukee Bucks (17-24) defeated the Toronto Raptors (13-28) 105-99 at the Air Canada Centre on Sunday. The score was the exact same total the Bucks won in Toronto on February 8th. The Bucks had four key players out due to injury and played eight players for the majority of the game. The Raptors started the game on an 11-2 run and built on that lead to as much as 13 points until the Bucks took their first lead of the game 75-74 with 2:06 left in the third quarter. The Raptors closed out the third 79-78, setting the stage for a tightly contested fourth quarter. However, the Bucks shot 6-for-15 from the field and were 13-for-18 from the free throw line for the final frame to give them the win. The Bucks were led by  Ersan Ilyasova  who scored 31 points, 12 rebounds and two steals,  Drew Gooden  scored 21 points, while  Mike Dunleavy  added 19 points, six rebounds and six assists off the bench. The Raptors were led by  DeMar DeRozan 's 21 points, while  Jerryd Bayless  added 16 and six assists starting in place of injured point guard  Jose Calderon . QUOTABLE:  "I feel confident because I get a lot of minutes to play, with a lot of injuries we have. We're short on the big guys and I got this opportunity to step up and play basketball the way I do. I try and give 110 percent offensively as well as defensively."   -- Ilyasova on his improved play QUOTABLE II:  "Huge road victory for us. Every game right now is important to us for our goal that we want to accomplish and that is making the playoffs. Every game is important right now."   -- Gooden on the Bucks' playoff chase THE STAT:  Team fouls. The Raptors committed 30 team fouls to the Bucks' 18 and four Raptors players finished the game with five fouls. That disparity manifested itself further with the Bucks attempting 35 free throws to the Raptors' 19, almost sending them to the charity stripe twice as often. TURNING POINT:  While there was seven lead changes in the fourth quarter the Raptors had an opportunity to make one last run. But with 1:17 left  Andrea Bargnani  committed an offensive foul turning over the ball with Milwaukee up 101-97, and the game was out of reach. HOT:  Ilyasova played a strong second quarter for the Bucks, scoring 11 points on 4-for-5 shooting adding five rebounds. The Bucks finished the quarter on an 11-6 run, of which Ilyasova scored six points to close the quarter at 56-51. He's averaging 23.6 points and 10.0 rebounds over the past five games. NOTABLE:  The Bucks were without  Andrew Bogut  (ankle),  Stephen Jackson  (hamstring)  Shaun Livingston  (ankle) and  Luc Mbah a Moute  (knee) ...
