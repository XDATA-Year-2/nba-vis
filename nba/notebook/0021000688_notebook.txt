Washington is now 0-22 on the road this season. Durant had 40 points, his fourth 40-point game this season. Westbrook had a triple-double, his second of the season, with 35 points, 13 rebounds and 13 assists.  Nick Young  led the Wizards with 32 points while  Rashard Lewis  added 22. Oklahoma City has now won six straight home games. QUOTABLE:  "We got the stops we needed at the end and KD hit some big shots.We've certainly got some things we need to work on but we kept battling and didn't give up."   --Thunder coach  Scott Brooks THE STAT:  In the second overtime, Durant and Westbrook combined for all 14 of Oklahoma City's points on 6-for-7 shooting. TURNING POINT:  The Thunder shot 75 percent (6-for-8) while holding the Wizards to just 30 percent (3-for-10) in the second overtime. OKC also outrebounded Washington 6-2 in the final OT while outscoring the Wizards 14-7. QUOTABLE II:  "They're a good team, they have talented players and they played hard. Washington did a good job it could have gone either way tonight."   -- Scott Brooks HOT:  In the two overtime periods, Durant, OKC's leading scorer, scored 15 points on 6-for-7 shooting. NOT:  Also in the two overtimes, Young, Washington's leading scorer, had just seven points on 3-for-8 shooting. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Westbrook filled the stat sheet once again scoring 35 points on 12-for-24 shooting. He pulled down 13 rebounds and dished 13 assists. He also blocked two shots. GOOD MOVE:  With the injury to Thunder shooting guard  Thabo Sefolosha , Brooks activated guard  Daequan Cook . Cook, a 3-point specialist was 3-for-7 from long range while the rest of the Thunder were just 2-for-14. ROOKIE WATCH:  Wizards point guard  John Wall  played 51:54 and scored 13 points. He handed out 10 assists and pulled down five rebounds. NOTABLE:  Oklahoma City is now 5-0 in overtime games. UP NEXT:  For the Wizards, Saturday @ Memphis, Monday @ Dallas, Tuesday @ New Orleans.
