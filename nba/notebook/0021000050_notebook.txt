
 Wolves-Heat notebook   By Shandel Richardson, for NBA.com Posted Tuesday November 2, 2010 11:27PM THE FACTS:   Dwyane Wade  scored 26 points and  LeBron James  added 20 points and 12 assists in the Miami Heat's 129-97 victory against the Minnesota Timberwolves Tuesday at AmericanAirlines Arena. QUOTABLE:  "What I saw [Tuesday] out of LeBron was a high IQ game. He managed and dissected the game with his mind... He wasn't 100 percent and was able to make plays and really set up guys with wide open shots." -- Heat coach  Erik Spoelstra THE STAT:  The Heat bench scored 58 points. TURNING POINT:  When Timberwolves leading scorer  Michael Beasley  left with a left thigh contusion in the second quarter, so did their offense. The Heat defense then took charge. HOT:  Wade was 12 of 17 from the field, doing most of the damage in the first half. NOT:  After shooting 42 percent in the first quarter, the Timberwolves shot just 36 percent for the game. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  With so many open looks,  James Jones  is becoming a potential option. He scored 17 points on 6 of 10 shooting. He was 5 of 9 on 3-pointers. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Game didn't generate buzz because the opponent. No celebrity sightings. GOOD MOVE:  With Wade and Jones having the hot hand in the first half, James became more of a distributor. It allowed him to provide opportunities for teammates. BAD MOVE:  The Timberwolves probably could've went inside to  Kevin Love  more against  Chris Bosh  early but that became tougher once the Heat's lead expanded. ROOKIE WATCH:  Timberwolves forward  Wesley Johnson  scored 13 points off the bench. NOTABLE:  The Heat have won their past four games by an average of 20.2 points. UP NEXT:  For the Heat, Friday @ New Orleans, Saturday vs. New Jersey, Tuesday vs. Utah. For the Timberwolves, Wednesday @ Orlando, Friday vs. Atlanta, Sunday at Houston.
