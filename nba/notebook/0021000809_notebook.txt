  Grizzlies-Nuggets notebook   By Marlon W. Morgan, for NBA.com Posted Sunday February 13, 2011 10:02PM THE FACTS:  Having already lost 11 of its last games to Denver by an average margin of 11.5, the outcome didn't look bright for Memphis when it trailed, 86-69, late in the third quarter. But the Grizzlies turned up the defense, then rode  Zach Randolph  down the stretch to pull out a 116-108 win in front of 15,398 at FedExForum. The Grizzlies have won 11 of their last 14 games. QUOTABLE:  ``Momentum is a powerful thing in the NBA. ... Our confidence kind of shrunk up and disappeared a little bit. My biggest concern right now is that we have to figure out how to be more defensive-minded. We try to win everything with our offense. Giving up 116 points really makes it very difficult to win on the road. You have to play an almost perfect game.''   -  Denver coach  George Karl. THE STAT:  The Nuggets' explosive offense held a 15-5 advantage over the Grizzlies in fast break points in the first half as they built a 67-55 lead. The Grizzlies, however, put an end to that in the second half, holding Denver to just two fast break points, while scoring 14 themselves out in the open court. TURNING POINT:  Down 17 in the second half with 3:56 remaining in the third quarter, the Grizzlies got the defensive boost they needed from guard  Tony Allen , whose three steals that led to fast break baskets helped change the game. From there, the Grizzlies got out and began pushing the ball up the floor on nearly every possession, which led to a 27-10. GOOD MOVE:  Seeing how easily the Nuggets were getting to the basket and scoring in the paint while building their 17-point cushion, Grizzlies coach  Lionel Hollins  opted to pull 7-foot center  Marc Gasol  and his 15 points and seven boards from the game. Gasol, who was having matchup problems defensively, did not play in the four quarter. Hollins, instead, went to a smaller lineup primarily consisting of  Darrell Arthur  and  Zach Randolph . Arthur responded with a career-high 24 points and six rebounds, while Randolph came up big in the fourth quarter, scoring 12 of his 14 points and grabbing six of his 16 boards after starting the game 0 for 6. HOT:  Arthur had struggled offensively in his last two games, shooting a combined 7 of 24 from the floor. But after making 5 of his first 6 shots against Denver, it was clear that slump was over. After putting in extra work on his jumper in the gym on Saturday, Arthur made 8 of 11 shots to score a career-high 24 points. NOT:  It was a bad evening for both starting shooting guards. Denver's  Arron Afflalo  was 1 of 8 from the floor for four points, while Grizzlies' starter  Sam Young  made 3 of 11 shots, scoring just six points. Both were the only members of their team's starting lineups who failed to score in double digits. QUOTABLE II:  ``We feel like we have found our identity now. Now we know who we are and everyone knows their role. Everybody has a good understanding of what coach wants from us. We are applying everything that we are learning and everyone is starting to buy into it.''   -  Grizzlies guard Sam Young. NOTABLE:  The Grizzlies improved to 30-26, putting them four games over .500 for the first time this season. It's also the quickest they've reached the 30-win total since the 2004-05 season when they won their 30th game on Feb. 11, 2005. ... Denver star  Carmelo Anthony  finished with a game-high 28 points, but was just 1 of 5 from the floor in the fourth quarter, missing on his final four attempts as the Nuggets tried to rally. As a team, the Nuggets shot just 37 percent in the fourth quarter after shooting 60.7 percent through three quarters. ... Ten of Denver's 15 turnovers were committed in the second half. ... Memphis shot a season-high .557 (44 of 79) from the floor, including a 12 of 19 effort in the fourth quarter which led to 34 points. UP NEXT:  For the Nuggets, Monday at Houston, Wednesday at Milwaukee, Feb. 22 vs. Memphis. For the Grizzlies, Tuesday vs. Philadelphia, Feb. 22 at Denver, Feb. 23 at Minnesota.
