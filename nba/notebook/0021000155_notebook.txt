  Lakers-Bucks notebook   By Rick Braun, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday November 17, 2010 12:08AM THE FACTS:   Shannon Brown  scored 16 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter, and Kobe Bryant shared game honors with 31 points as the Los Angeles Lakers overcame 31 points by Brandon Jennings to down the Milwaukee Bucks 118-107 Tuesday night at the Bradley Center. The Lakers (9-2) snapped a two-game skid and ended Milwaukee's three-game winning streak as the Bucks fell to 5-6. QUOTABLE:  "Everybody told Shannon he had to learn how to shoot a jump shot when he came into the NBA and he's taken that seriously and worked hard on it and now he's a legitimate 3-point shooter."    -- Lakers coach  Phil Jackson  on Brown, who was 7-for-9 from the field and 4-for-5 from 3-point range. THE STAT:  Along with Brown's 4-for-5 shooting on 3-pointers,  Matt Barnes  made both he took and  Steve Blake  made two of three, giving the Laker bench an 8-for-10 night on 3-pointers. The Lakers were 10-for-16 as a team on 3s. TURNING POINT:  Milwaukee had trimmed a 104-90 deficit in half with a 7-0 run and Jennings faked up for a 3-pointer and got Blake up in the air. Jennings leaned forward to try to draw contact but didn't get the call and his shot rimmed out. Seconds later, Brown drained his third 3-pointer of the quarter, and what could have been a four-point deficit had Jennings got the call or had his shot dropped was back to 10 at 107-97 with 5:35 left. QUOTABLE II:  "That was a six-point swing. It was huge. ... When you're trailing and you've got a chance to get a three-point play, and then somebody else comes down and hits a three, that's huge. That's a momentum changer."   -- Brown on his 3-pointer seconds after Jennings' 3-pointer that would have pulled Milwaukee within four rimmed out. HOT: Drew Gooden  had his best night since coming to the Bucks as a free agent in the summer, hitting eight of 11 shots, including his first two 3-pointers of the season. He finished with 22 points and 13 rebounds. He entered the game shooting 38.7 percent from the field. NOT:  Although he played big with 18 points and four blocked shots, Bucks center  Andrew Bogut  was just 2-for-10 on free throws. He also had a 3-for-10 night at the line in the season opener and is shooting just 46.3 percent (19-for-41) for the season. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Jennings' 31 points were a season-high and he chipped in six assists. Bryant had seven rebounds and three assists to go with his 31 points. INSIDE THE ARENA:  A number of Green Bay Packers were in the premium courtside seats including starting quarterback  Aaron Rodgers . Although a California native, Rodgers wore a Bucks hat and pointed to it when he was shown on the large screen of the scoreboard between the third and fourth quarters. GOOD MOVE:  One game after his bench went 1-for-18 in a victory over Golden State on Saturday, Bucks coach  Scott Skiles  didn't hesitate to send in the second unit in a wave near the end of the first quarter.  Corey Maggette  (4-for-6),  Earl Boykins  (3-for-3) and  Ersan Ilyasova  (2-for-3) combined to go 9-for-12 in the first half to help the Bucks to a 59-57 lead. ROOKIE WATCH:  Bucks center  Larry Sanders  played just four minutes but had two blocks in that time. NOTABLE:  The Lakers entered the game as the league's top scoring team at 112.5 points per game. "It'll be a tough game for us to win if they score 112 points," Bucks coach Skiles said before the game. He was spot-on with that prediction. ... The Bucks shot 55.3 percent (26-for-47) in the first half and made six of 10 3-pointers. In the second half they were just 15-for-42 (35.7 percent) and 3-for-14 (21.4 percent) on 3-pointers. UP NEXT:  For the Lakers, Wednesday @ Detroit, Friday @ Minnesota, Sunday vs. Golden State. For the Bucks, Friday @ Philadelphia, Saturday vs. Oklahoma City, Nov. 24 @ Cleveland.
