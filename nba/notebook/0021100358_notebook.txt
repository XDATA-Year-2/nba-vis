  Notebook: Wizards 111, Raptors 108 Posted Tuesday February 7, 2012 12:18AM By Rich Dubroff, for NBA.com    THE FACTS: John Wall  had 31 points and  Nick Young  added a season-high 29 points as the Washington Wizards blew an 18-point deficit and hung on to beat the Toronto Raptors 111-108 in overtime on Monday night. Washington held Toronto without a field goal in overtime and outscored it 6-3. It was the Wizards' fifth win in 25 games.  Trevor Booker  added a season-high 19 points. Jerryd Bayless  and  Linas Klieiza  each had a season-high 30 points for the Raptors. Bayless scored 16 points in the fourth quarter to help force overtime. QUOTABLE:  "That was a bad exhibition of basketball."   -- Toronto coach  Dwane Casey  on his team's loss THE STAT:  After the Raptors outrebounded Washington 61-34 in Friday's loss, Toronto had just one more rebound than the Wizards -- 42-41. The 61 rebounds was a franchise high. TURNING POINT:  Young hit two free throws with 1:06 to play to give Washington a 109-106 lead.     QUOTABLE II:  "You have to go off on them at halftime to get them to play. It shouldn't ever have to get to that -- and that's why I was disappointed -- even with that second-half comeback."­   -- Casey on his halftime tirade HOT:  Kleiza was 11-for-16 from the field. His 3-pointer with 57.8 seconds left in regulation helped force overtime. NOT: Amir Johnson.  He missed six of seven from the field. The one he hit, a dunk with 10.5 seconds left in regulation, tied the score at 105. In overtime, he had three shots blocked in 16 seconds -- two by Wall and one by Booker. GOOD MOVE:  Wizards coach  Randy Wittman  told Wall to relax, and he responded. Wall was 10-for-19 from the field and 11-for-14 from the line. "That's as good a game I've had with him," Wittman said. BAD MOVE:  Casey played  Aaron Gray  for the first eight minutes -- and then sat him in favor of a shorter lineup the rest of the way. NOTABLE:  Wizards forward  Rashard Lewis  was a late scratch with a sore left knee. It was the third time he missed a game with the injury. Wittman said he was day-to-day. IN THE ARENA:  The announced attendance was 14,687, but most of the seats were empty. UP NEXT:  For the Raptors: Wednesday vs. Milwaukee, Friday vs. Boston, Sunday vs. L.A. Lakers. For the Wizards: Wednesday vs. New York, Friday vs. Miami, Sunday @ Detroit
