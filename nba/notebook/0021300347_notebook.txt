 THE FACT:  The Portland Trail Blazers established a new franchise record with 21 made 3-pointers, shattering the previous mark of 17. They were 21-for-37 from beyond the arc. 
 
 THE LEAD: LaMarcus Aldridge  was terrific once again with 20 points and 16 rebounds in leading the Portland Trail Blazers to a 139-105 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday night at the Wells Fargo Center.  Nicolas Batum  scored 17 points and had nine assists while  Damian Lillard  scored 16 points.  Dorell Wright  had 15 points,  Wesley Matthews  14,  Mo Williams  14 and  Robin Lopez  12.  Thomas Robinson  became the eighth player to reach double figures with 10 points. The Trail Blazers won their third straight and improved to 20-4. 
 The Sixers were led by  Tony Wroten  with 18 points.  Hollis Thompson  scored 17 points,  Spencer Hawes  added 16,  Thaddeus Young  15 and  James Anderson  14. It was the sixth loss in a row for the Sixers, who dropped to 7-18. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It was a fun game." 
 -- Trail Blazers coach  Terry Stotts 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Trail Blazers' 139 points were the most in the league this season. The Los Angeles Clippers scored 137 against the Houston Rockets on Nov. 4. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Trail Blazers blitzed the Sixers with a 40-15 spurt in the third quarter. That pushed the lead to 111-79 and completely put the game away. 
 
 HOT:  Wright hit all five of his 3-pointers, Aldridge was 10-for-15 and Batum knocked down six of his 10 shots. 
 
 NOT:  Sixers leading scorer  Evan Turner  was limited to three points on 1-for-7 shooting.  Lavoy Allen  was also 1-for-7. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Portland started hot from beyond the arc and kept shooting. It worked and wound up becoming a franchise record. Six different Trail Blazers had at least one 3-pointer. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Sixers' defense on the perimeter was lacking on this night. They could have challenged Portland's shooters more consistently. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  There was a sparse crowd of 10,189 with the inclement weather in the area. The fans who showed up were treated to a fast-paced game with plenty of offense. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "They were all open good looks. It shows how well we're moving the ball right now." 
 -- Damian Lillard, on Portland's 41 assists and 21 3-pointers 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Sixers rookie point guard  Michael Carter-Williams  missed his sixth consecutive game because of a skin infection on his right knee. The Sixers are 1-8 in games without him this season. "There is no exact timeline yet," coach  Brett Brown  said about Carter-Williams' eventual return. ... The NBA record for 3-pointers made in a game is 23. ... The Trail Blazers had 41 assists, their highest total since compiling 45 Nov. 17, 1990 at Denver. ... This was just the second game this season in which a Sixer failed to reach 20 points. ... Portland's 139 points is its most since also scoring 139 against the Phoenix Suns on Nov. 14, 1997. ... It's also the most points the Sixers have allowed since giving up 149 at Seattle on Match 6, 1997. ... All 13 Trail Blazers scored. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "At the end of the day, we've just got to put this one behind us and just try to get to the next game." 
 -- Thaddeus Young 
 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Trail Blazers, Sunday @ Detroit, Tuesday @ Cleveland, Wednesday @ Minnesota. For the Sixers, Monday @ Brooklyn, Friday vs. Brooklyn, Saturday @ Milwaukee.
