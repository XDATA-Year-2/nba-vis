  Notebook: Suns 96, Kings 88 Posted Monday March 5, 2012 1:33AM By Mike Tulumello, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  It's hard to say whether the Suns are one of the NBA's hottest teams or -- from a schedule standpoint -- one of the luckiest. In either case, the Suns finished what they set out to do the past couple of weeks. They finished their season's longest homestand 5-1 after coming from behind to beat the visiting Sacramento Kings 96-88 Sunday night. The Suns have gone 3-0 since the All Star break to move to 17-20, giving them a realistic shot at making a playoff run. The Suns came from 10 points down (43-33 in the second quarter), the third straight game they've erased a double-digit deficit to win. Marcin Gortat  had 14 points and 17 rebounds, while  Steve Nash  added 19 points and seven assists. Shannon Brown  (13 points) gave the Suns a huge lift, nailing a pair of key 3-pointers late to put the Suns over the top. "Shannon Brown gave us separation," Suns coach  Alvin Gentry  said. For the Kings (12-25),  Marcus Thornton  had 21 points while  DeMarcus Cousins  had 16 points and 14 boards, though he shot just 7-for-20. "If we don't finish plays in the paint, it puts pressure on our defense," Kings coach  Keith Smart  said. QUOTABLE:  "We made a plan for these three wins. Now we have them."    -- Gortat on the Suns, one of five NBA teams to go 3-0 after the All Star break. THE STAT:  The Kings shot just 38 percent, including 15 percent (2-for-13) on 3-pointers. TURNING POINT:  With the Suns leading 74-73 early in the final quarter, they sprinted off on an 11-1 run to put it away. Brown hit a pair of 3-pointers and  Jared Dudley  added another while the Kings' Thornton had a turnover and missed an uncontested layup. QUOTABLE II:  "They're a hard team to play because they are so athletic and have so many scorers. They're a lot like Golden State."    -- Gentry on the Kings HOT:  Gortat, though his streak of six straight games of 17-plus points was broken, shot 7-for-11. NOT:  Channing Frye shot 3-for-12, making him 5-for-30 over the past two games. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Brown is trending up for the Suns. Over the past four games, he's averaged 9.5 points on 47 percent shooting. INSIDE THE ARENA:  A front-row Suns fan, one of the team's investors, needed medical attention after Dudley crashed into him while chasing an errant pass by Gortat. The fan was taken to an emergency room, but a Suns doctor indicated he should be OK. ROOKIE WATCH:  For the Suns,  Markieff Morris  had another bad shooting game, going 0-for-7. For the Kings,  Isaiah Thomas , the 60th and final pick of last year's draft, shot 3-for-13 and had eight points.  Jimmer Fredette , a lottery pick, failed to score in 10 minutes as his teammates didn't look for him. NOTABLE:  In winning three straight, the Suns have come from 10-plus points behind in all of them. This is the first time they've done this in nearly 10 years (November, 2002). They rallied from 10 points down Thursday to beat the Timberwolves, from 11 points behind Friday to edge the Clippers and from 10 points down to defeat the Kings. UP NEXT:  For the Kings, Monday @ Denver, Wednesday vs. New Orleans, Friday vs. Dallas. For the Suns, Wednesday @ Oklahoma City, Thursday vs. Dallas, Saturday vs. Memphis.
