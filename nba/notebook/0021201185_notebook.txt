 THE FACTS : For a team in the rare position of having nothing to play for, the Dallas Mavericks played spoiler and pulled out a 108-105 overtime victory Friday against the Denver Nuggets at the American Airlines Center.  
 
 Vince Carter  and  Dirk Nowitzki  scored 22 points each and  O.J. Mayo  added 20 for the Mavericks (39-40), who are missing the postseason for the first time since 2000. 
 Dallas denied Denver (54-25) a chance to break the team's season record for wins and snapped the Nuggets' five-game winning streak.  Andre Iguodala, Wilson Chandler  and  Corey Brewer  scored 18 points each for Denver, which is battling for the No. 3 seed in the West. Iguodala had a chance to send it to a second overtime, but his 3-pointer at the buzzer fell short. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "Us not making the playoffs doesn't mean we can't lay it all out there and fight to the end. We did it for our fans and our organization. Each individual knew we were going to lay it out there for each other and for the good of the team, and it starts with the old guys. The old guys are still playing big minutes and battling." 
 -- Vince Carter 
 
 THE STAT : The Mavericks have now had at least two 20-point scorers in each of their last four games. Dallas is 15-5 this season when two or more score at least 20.   
 
 TURNING POINT : After an  Andre Miller  layup gave Denver the first lead in the extra session, Mayo tied it with a running jumper and gave Dallas the lead for good with a 3-pointer at the 2:40 mark. Mayo finished 5-for-7 from behind the arc and the Mavericks improved to 6-1 when he makes at least five 3-pointers. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "We reside in kind of an altered state of zaniness, our team. It's just kind of been that way. It's never easy. It's a bit of an adventure, but they're good guys and they're trying." 
 --Mavericks coach  Rick Carlisle  on playing in an 11th overtime game, three more than the previous franchise record 
 
 HOT : The Mavericks shot 48 percent (11-for-23) from 3-point range. Dallas is 17-6 this season when draining 10 or more triples. 
 
 NOT : Miller was 2-for-12 from the field and made four turnovers, none more costly than his fumble with 1:10 left in overtime and Denver trailing 106-103. 
 
 GOOD MOVE : Carter was extremely active on the glass at both ends, finishing with a season- and game-high 12 rebounds for his first double-double of the year. That included eight offensive boards, matching a career high set on Nov. 5, 2005. He also led the Mavericks with seven assists and blocked two shots. 
 
 BAD MOVE : Dallas nearly let the game slip away in regulation with a series of blunders. Leading 99-97 with 21.7 seconds left,  Brandan Wright  missed two free throws. On the next possession, Mayo had the ball poked away in the backcourt. Then, after Brewer knotted it at 99-99 with a layup with 3.9 seconds left, Mayo missed a finger roll as time expired. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT : Denver guard  Ty Lawson  returned after missing eight of the last nine games with a torn plantar fascia in his right foot. He played 19 minutes off the bench and tallied 13 points on 5-for-7 shooting with three assists. Lawson scored Denver's first seven points in the fourth. 
 
 QUOTABLE III : "Look, it didn't work out the way we planned. It's all on me and [president of basketball operations]  Donnie [Nelson] . Period. End of story. It's our job to put people in position to succeed. We didn't do enough of it." 
 --Mavericks owner  Mark Cuban  on his team missing the playoffs for the first time since 2000 
 
 NOTABLE : Nowitzki needs 10 points to become just the 17th player in NBA history with 25,000. ... Mavericks forward  Elton Brand  returned after missing four games with a sore right calf, finishing with four rebounds, two blocks and two points in 14 minutes. ... The Mavericks are now 3-8 in overtime and the Nuggets are 4-2. ... Denver has three more chances to break the franchise record for most wins in a season (NBA era). The Nuggets were 54-28 in 1987-88 and 2008-09. ... Dallas is 24-5 when it has at least 25 assists (29). ... Denver lost for just the second time in 17 games this season when scoring 25 or more fast-break points. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Mavericks, Sunday @ New Orleans, Monday vs. Memphis, Wednesday vs. New Orleans. For the Nuggets, Sunday vs. Portland, Monday @ Milwaukee, Wednesday vs. Phoenix.
