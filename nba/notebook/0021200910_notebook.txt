 THE FACTS: Sebastian Telfair , relegated to the bench for all but seven minutes since being traded to Toronto from Phoenix, scored 13 points in 26-plus minutes and the Raptors routed the Suns  98-71 Wednesday. 
 
 DeMar DeRozan  scored 15 and  Amir Johnson  added 14 for the Raptors, who outscored Phoenix 26-16 in the second quarter to turn a four-point lead after the first into a 54-40 advantage. 
 The Suns already were without backup center  Jermaine O'Neal , who left the team while his 13-year-old daughter undergoes surgery to repair a leaky heart valve. Phoenix then lost starter  Marcin Gortat  with 34.6 left in the first quarter when he came down with a rebound and stepped on Johnson's foot. 
 
 Marcus Morris  was the only Suns player in double figures, coming off the bench to score 12. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Anytime your spot is taken or given away you want to come out there and show you are a player. I do this for my family and my kids. I got to do this." 
 
 -- Sebastian Telfair  
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Suns had 20 turnovers before the third quarter was over en route to a season-worst 29 leading to 39 Raptors points. 
 
 THE STAT II:  Suns-killer  Rudy Gay , who has averaged 20.7 points against Phoenix while with Memphis, finished with five points on 2-for-7 shooting. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "There's nothing positive to take from that game except it's over." 
 
 -- Suns coach  Lindsey Hunter 
 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Gortat's departure, which forced the Suns to play small. Phoenix's only center was  Hamed Haddadi , who had not played since coming to the Suns from Toronto. The Raptors outscored Phoenix 73-49 after Gortat went down.  
 
 HOT:  DeRozan was 7-for-13 from the floor, Johnson 5-for-8. The Raptors bench was 19-for-39 from the floor and outscored Phoenix's reserves 54-32. 
 
 NOT:  Only Morris' 3-pointer with 23 seconds left kept Phoenix from matching the franchise's 32-year-old record for fewest points in a game. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Haddadi  became the first Suns player to wear a jersey number higher than 55 in a game. ... All 11 Raptors who played scored at least three points, with six in double figures. ... Phoenix's 29 turnovers were a franchise high at US Airways Center. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Raptors, Friday @ L.A. Lakers, Sunday vs. Cleveland, Wednesday @ Boston. For the Suns, Friday @ Sacramento, Saturday vs. Houston, Monday vs. Denver.
