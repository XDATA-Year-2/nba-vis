
 Knicks-Bulls notebook   By Kent McDill, for NBA.com Posted Friday November 5, 2010 12:25AM THE FACTS:  Led by  Toney Douglas ,  Danilo Gallinari  and  Raymond Felton , the New York Knicks made 16 of 24 3-point shots and easily defeated the host Bulls 120-112 at the United Center Thursday. It was New York's first game since Saturday because of the postponement of Tuesday's home game against Orlando. QUOTABLE:  "We know it is not going to be like this every night, and we will have to find another way to win on those nights,''    -- Gallinari THE STAT:  The Bulls entered the game as the league's best 3-point defense, having allowed just nine of 50 shots in the first three games. The Knicks hit 16-for-24 3-pointers (67 percent) Thursday. TURNING POINT:  The Knicks went on a 17-6 run in the first five minutes of the second quarter to turn a 34-30 game into a 51-36 contest. The Bulls got no closer than eight points the rest of the game, and that came on the game's final basket. HOT:  Gallinari was 7-for-11 overall, 4-for-4 from 3-point range, 6-for-6 from the free throw line for 24 points.  Toney Douglas  of the Knicks was 9-for-14 from the field, 5-for-9 from 3-point range, seven for seven from the free throw line for 30 points. NOT:  On a night when the outside shot was falling, New York's  Amar'e Stoudemire  was 5-for-21 from the field, finishing with 14 points. The Knicks made just 24-for-56 shots (42.8 percent) from inside the arc. GOOD/BAD MOVE:  With 9:30 left and the Knicks ahead 104-87 and seemingly never going to miss from outside, Bulls coach  Tom Thibodeau  pulled  Derrick Rose  and  Luol Deng  from the game, saving his best players for Friday's game at Boston. QUOTABLE II:  "I'm encouraged with what I have seen. We have won two games with Amar'e not playing all that well."   --  New York Knicks head coach  Mike D'Antoni NOTABLE:  Chicago's  Joakim Noah  made it four straight double-doubles with 13 points and 12 rebounds. Rose   had 14 assists for the Bulls, and  Kyle Korver  had his best game as a Bull, scoring 18 points with four 3-pointers. UP NEXT:  For the Bulls, Friday at Boston, Monday vs. Denver, Thursday vs. Golden State. For the Knicks, Friday vs. Washington, Sunday vs. Philadelphia, Tuesday at Milwaukee.
