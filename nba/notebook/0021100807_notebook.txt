  Notebook: Mavericks 95, Grizzlies 85 Posted Wednesday April 4, 2012 11:54PM By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  Memphis controlled the game through three quarters, but fatigue caught up to the Grizzlies in the fourth quarter Wednesday and so did the Mavericks.  Dirk Nowitzki  led Dallas to a 95-85 victory with 23 points and 10 rebounds, snapping a three-game winning streak by a Memphis squad playing the final game of a back-to-back-to-back and its fifth game in six nights. Shawn Marion  added 16 points,  Jason Terry  tallied 15 and  Delonte West  had 14 for the Mavs (31-24), who had dropped their last three meetings with the Grizzlies (30-23). The teams clash again Saturday in Memphis to decide the season series.  O.J. Mayo  paced Memphis with 17 points, courtesy of his 4-for-5 shooting from downtown. QUOTABLE:  "We kept staying ahead, staying ahead, and then right at the end we kind of let go of the rope a little bit. They got the lead and sustained their run. They got a little more aggressive offensively and kept attacking the basket, and we just didn't have enough to hold the finger in the dike."  --  Memphis head coach  Lionel Hollins. THE STAT:  It was a rare rally for Dallas. This is just the third time the Mavericks have won a game this season when trailing after three quarters (3-20). Memphis led 68-66 entering the fourth. The defending champs were 18-22 in that situation last season. TURNING POINT:  Dallas used a 21-4 run from the 9:39 mark of the fourth quarter through the 3:01 mark to flip a 73-68 deficit into an 89-77 advantage. The Grizzlies' only points in that stretch came on a layup by Mayo and one free throw each from  Marc Gasol  and Mayo. They were 1-for-12 during the cold snap. QUOTABLE II:  "I think we ran out of gas."  --  Memphis guard  Mike Conley. QUOTABLE III:  "Our motto is 'don't even worry about it,' so if something goes wrong out on the floor or somebody is out of the lineup, we just tell ourselves don't even worry about it, just keep playing. That's what has been keeping us in these games and keeping us positive."  --  Terry. HOT:  Starting for the injured  Jason Kidd  (right groin strain), West finished 6-for-7 and knocked down both of his 3-point attempts in his highest-scoring game since Jan. 30 at Phoenix (25 points). NOT:  The Grizzlies scored just 34 points in the second half on 30 percent shooting (12-for-40). After intermission,  Rudy Gay  was 0-for-5, Gasol was 1-for-6 and Conley was 1-for-6. GOOD MOVE:  Terry picked of a sloppy pass by Gay and drove to the basket before dishing it behind his back to a trailing Marion for an easy layup and an 85-77 lead. BAD MOVE:  Shortly after missing a wide-open finger roll, things got even more embarrassing for Mavericks forward  Lamar Odom  when he touched nothing but air on a free-throw misfire with 56.9 seconds left in the third quarter. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Gasol shot just 3-for-13, but still had a nice night for fantasy owners with 10 points, 10 rebounds, seven assists and four blocked shots. ... Backup center  Ian Mahinmi  matched his season high with 10 boards for the Mavericks. NOTABLE:  Terry's 3-pointer with 4:59 left in the game was the 1,760th of his career, matching  Peja Stojakovic  for fifth place in NBA history. ... The Mavericks improved to 5-19 when trailing by 10 or more points this year. They were down 46-36 in the second quarter. ... Memphis guard  Tony Allen  went to the locker room midway through the fourth quarter with an apparent bloody nose. ... Mayo has led the Grizzlies in scoring in four straight games, the longest streak of his career. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Friday vs. Portland, Saturday @ Memphis, Tuesday vs. Sacramento. For the Grizzlies, Friday @ Miami, Saturday vs. Dallas, Monday vs. L.A. Clippers.
