  Notebook: Trail Blazers 112, Bobcats 68   By Kerry Eggers, for NBA.com Posted Thursday February 2, 2012 1:25AM THE FACTS:  It was all Portland from start to finish in a 112-69 shellacking of woeful Charlotte Wednesday night at the Rose Garden. The Blazers (13-9) jumped in front 35-18 after one quarter and led 92-48 after three quarters in its most one-sided victory of the season.  Jamal Crawford  scored 24 points in 21 minutes off the bench as the Blazers improved to 10-1 at home.  Gerald Wallace  added 23 points and  LaMarcus Aldridge  22 for the winners.  Gerald Henderson  scored 16 points for the Bobcats (3-20), who dropped their 10th in a row. QUOTABLE:  "Not at all. I wanted to keep going. I didn't even want to come out of the game. It stings. Like I said last year around this time, I felt I was betrayed, I was stabbed in the back. This was my first opportunity to play against them. You get that out of the way, and you move forward."    -- Gerald Wallace, asked if he felt sorry for the team that traded him at midseason last year. THE STAT:  Portland won virtually every category, including field-goal percentage (.550 to .325), 3-point percentage (.500 to .111), rebounds (43-39), steals (18-6), points in the paint (58-26) and fast-break points (23-8). TURNING POINT:  It was 9-7 midway through the first quarter when the Blazers turned on the jets, outscoring the Bobcats 18-4 over the next four minutes. It was never a contest thereafter. QUOTABLE II:  "You take three top players off anyone's team and they're not going to do well. If I had a full squad and we were losing this way, it would be awful. But you take Aldridge and Wallace off [the Blazers], and see what kind of team you have."   -- Charlotte coach  Paul Silas , who was without injured starters  D.J. Augustin  and  Corey Maggette  and lost a third one, guard Gerald Henderson, to a hamstring injury in the second half. HOT:  Crawford missed his first three shots, then made eight in a row -- the first three 3-pointers. He finished 9-for-14 from the field, including 4-for-6 from 3-point range. NOT:  Charlotte rookie  Kemba Walker  looked out of his element all night, making 1-for-11 shots from the field. QUOTABLE III:  "Basketball's a humbling game. Some days, you have it like that, and some days it's a dogfight. You take the wins any way you can get them."    -- Jamal Crawford. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Carolina Panthers quarterback  Derek Anderson , a former Oregon State standout, was in the house. GOOD MOVE:  Crawford's dipsy-do layup for his eighth straight basket at the end of the third quarter was the offensive move of the night.  Marcus Camby 's block of a Walker run-out earlier in the period was the defensive play of the game. BAD MOVE:  Walker -- listed at 6-foot-1 but seemingly shorter -- kept trying to drive the ball to the basket. He was blocked four times. NOTABLE:  The 44-point margin was the most one-sided defeat in Charlotte franchise history. The Bobcats' previous record was 40 points in a 120-80 loss at Denver last season. The last time Portland won by more than 44 points was in a 120-75 rout of Dallas in November 1997. UP NEXT:  For the Blazers, Thursday at Sacramento, Saturday vs. Denver, Monday vs. Oklahoma City. For the Bobcats, Saturday at Phoenix, Tuesday at Boston, Friday vs. Chicago.
