 THE FACTS: O.J. Mayo  scored 25 points and  Chris Kaman  added 23 Wednesday night as the Dallas Mavericks survived a furious fourth-quarter rally to defeat the Washington Wizards, 107-101, at the American Airlines Center. The victory snapped a three-game slide by the Mavericks and left the Wizards as the only remaining winless team in the NBA at 0-7. 
 Down by as many as 22 points in the second half, Washington opened the fourth quarter with an 18-3 surge sparked by reserves  Kevin Seraphin  inside and  Cartier Martin  on the outside. Both scored 14 in the fourth, with Seraphin going 7-for-7 overall and Martin a perfect 4-for-4 from 3-point range.  Jordan Crawford , who finished with a team-high 21, was the only other Wizard who scored in the final quarter with six points. 
 Washington pulled to within three points five times in the final seven minutes, but couldn't close the gap. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "A win's a win. We can take many positives from those first three quarters and learn from the fourth quarter."
 -- Mavericks forward  Elton Brand,  who had his first double-double for Dallas with 11 points and a game-high 12 rebounds. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Wizards attempted 15 3-pointers and just one free throw during the first half, and that lone foul shot came after a canned 3-pointer by  Martell Webster . Webster hit the triple and was fouled by  Jae Crowder  at the 11:21 mark of the second quarter 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Down 101-98, Seraphin picked off a pass by  Darren Collison  and got the ball to  Jannero Pargo  for an open look on the wing. Pargo's potential tying 3-point attempt was off the mark with 54.9 seconds left and Vince Carter secured the rebound for Dallas. Mayo was fouled and sank his first free throw. He missed the second, but Carter was there to corral another clutch carom. He passed it off to Collison, who was fouled and hit two from the stripe to stretch the lead back to six. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Hey, you want fight. We fought. It's a learning process. We can't get down, but tonight we did fight back."
 -- Wizards head coach  Randy Wittman . 
 
 
 HOT:  The Mavericks erupted for 40 points in the second quarter, a season high for any quarter, by shooting 68.2 percent (15-for-22) and going 10-for-13 at the line. Dallas got 10 points from Kaman and 18 from its bench during the quarter. The Mavericks also posted a 10-0 advantage in fast-break points in the quarter. 
 
 NOT:  Coming off a 1-for-11 shooting night in Tuesday's loss to Charlotte, Wizards rookie  Bradley Beal  remained out of sync and visibly frustrated with a 3-for-14 effort against the Mavericks. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The decision by Mavericks coach  Rick Carlisle  to replace struggling center  Brandan Wright  with Kaman in the starting lineup paid off. Kaman was 10-for-12 from the field and added eight rebounds, three assists, one steal and one block in 32 minutes. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Wizards point guard  A.J. Price , who has been starting for the injured  John Wall , had to be helped off the court after spraining his right ankle early in the third quarter. He went to the locker room and had it re-taped, but did not return to the game. Price finished with 11 points and two assists. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Losing his starting spot at small forward to  Dahntay Jones  didn't have much of a negative effect on Crowder. The Dallas rookie played 21 minutes and contributed 12 points on 4-for-5 shooting with three assists, two steals and two boards. 
 
 NOTABLE:  None of the Mavericks' five starters played for Dallas last season. ... The Mavericks' last 40-point quarter came on March 10, 2011 in the second quarter against New York. ... Dallas has won five straight meetings with Washington, whose last victory in the series came on Oct. 27, 2009. ... The Mavericks improved to 4-1 at the American Airlines Center. ... Washington was out-rebounded 40-34 and outscored 46-28 in the paint. ... The Pistons (1-8) won their first game of the season earlier Wednesday against the 76ers. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Friday @ Indiana, Saturday @ Cleveland, Monday vs. Golden State. For the Wizards, Saturday vs. Utah, Monday vs. Indiana, Wednesday @ Atlanta.
