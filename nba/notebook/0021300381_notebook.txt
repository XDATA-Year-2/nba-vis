 THE FACT:  The Thunder are now 13-0 at home this season, tying an all-time franchise record for the best home start set in the 1976-77 season when the team was still in Seattle. 
 
 THE LEAD: Kevin Durant  and  Russell Westbrook  combined for 52 points and the Oklahoma City Thunder (21-4) pulled away from a stubborn Chicago Bulls (9-16) team to win 107-95. It is OKC's eighth straight win overall and the 16th in the last 17 games. 
 Durant led all scorers with 32 points, he also pulled down nine rebounds and handed out six assists. Westbrook had another double-double with 20 points and 10 assists.  Reggie Jackson  came off the Thunder bench to score 18 points on 8-for-12 shooting but Jackson had six turnovers. 
 The Bulls had six players in double figures, with  J oakim Noah  leading the way with 23 and 12 rebounds.  Taj Gibson  came off the Bulls bench to score 16 and  D.J. Augustin  added 15. 
 Chicago had to play without leading scorer  Luol Deng  who was held out with a sore Achilles, another starter  Jimmy Butle r had to leave the game with a sprained ankle in the second quarter. 
 The Thunder held the Bulls to just 37.7 percent shooting but Chicago stayed in the game thanks to going 29-for-39 at the free throw line compared to 12-for-14 for Oklahoma City. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I thought our defense was really outstanding all night long. We did a good job especially in the second half really getting up on the ball and denying passes and chasing guys through screens." --  Thunder head coach  Scott Brooks 
 
 
 THE STAT : During a two minute span of the third quarter Durant took things over during a Thunder run. He nailed a 3-pointer, grabbed a rebound off a missed Chicago shot, hit an 11-footer and then a nine foot jumper. That's seven points in two minutes, pushing the Thunder lead to 14 points. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I thought we still had a shot in the second half I thought we were within striking distance but we couldn't get the key stops when we needed them. They're good, you've got to give them credit but I thought our guys fought hard." --  Bulls head coach  Tom Thibodeau 
 
 
 TURNING POINT : Ibaka picked up his fourth foul with 10:26 left in the third quarter and OKC leading by just five points. Instead of taking  Serge Ibaka  out of the game Brooks left him in and over the next seven minutes the Thunder went on a 20-9 run to take what was at that point, their biggest lead of the game at 79-65. The Bulls clawed back to within seven in the fourth quarter but OKC quickly pushed the margin back into double digits. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "It was just a feel thing, he didn't play well in the first half and I thought he was ready to help us get on a roll." --  Brooks on why he left Ibaka in after he picked up his fourth foul 
 
 
 HOT:  The Thunder started the game 6-for-8 (75.0 percent) and finished the first quarter at 65.2 percent (15-for-23)...Durant was 5-for-7 (12 points) in the first 12 minutes...during an eight minute stretch of the first and second quarters Jackson scored 12 points on 6-for-8 shooting...Durant was 4-for-5 (eight points) in the third quarter...OKC shot 52.6 percent in the second half. 
 
 NOT:  Chicago shot just 35 percent (7-for-20) in the first quarter...The Bulls had 17 turnovers leading to 26 Thunder points. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA : It was the 127th consecutive sellout inside Chesapeake Energy Arena. 
 
 GOOD MOVE : In the first quarter Durant stole a pass from Noah and led a fast break down the floor, he jumped to avoid  Mike Dunleavy  and fired a pass to Westbrook who leapt to catch the pass and then fired it right back to Durant for a slam. 
 
 GOOD MOVE TOO : In the second quarter Ibaka blocked a Noah shot at the rim, Noah got the ball back, put up another shot and Ibaka blocked that one too.  Kendrick Perkins  grabbed the ball, fired an outlet pass to Durant who nailed a 3-pointer. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Thunder's aggressive defense got a little too aggressive in the first half. OKC was whistled for 16 fouls and the Bulls took 25 free throws, hitting 17 of them. The Thunder went to the line just four times in the first half, hitting three. That's how a team that shoots 35.7 percent in the first half can score 52 points and be within three points of the lead. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH : Bulls forward  Tony Snell  played 41 minutes scoring 10 points on 4-for-15 shooting. He also had eight rebounds. Thunder center  Steven Adams  played 27 minutes, scored four points, grabbed seven rebounds, picked off four steals and blocked two shots. 
 
 NOTABLE : Bulls guard Butler left the game in the second quarter with a sprained right ankle and did not return...OKC is now 51-1 when holding opponents to 42 percent shooting or worse since the start of last season. The Bulls shot 37.7 percent tonight. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Bulls: Saturday vs. Cleveland, Christmas Day @ Brooklyn, Dec. 28th vs. Dallas. For the Thunder: Saturday @ San Antonio, Sunday vs. Toronto, Christmas Day @ New York.
