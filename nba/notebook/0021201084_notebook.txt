 THE FACTS : The Utah Jazz put together a late run that keyed a come-from-behind 105-95 victory over the Portland TRail Blazers Friday night at the Rose Garden. 
 
 Mo Williams  scored 26 of his game-high 28 points in the second half for the Jazz (37-36), who moved into a tie with the Los Angeles Lakers for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. 
 
 Paul Millsap  had 25 points and 10 rebounds and  Al Jefferson  contributed 22 points and eight boards for the winners, who closed the game by outscoring the Trail Blazers 25-6 down the stretch. 
 
 Damian Lillard  scored 24 points and handed out seven assists and  J.J. Hickson  collected 17 points and 14 rebounds for the Blazers (33-39), who had six of their 16 turnovers in the fourth quarter. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "The guys really hung in there. The aggressive play we had on the defensive end down the stretch set the tone for us."  
 --Utah coach  Tyrone Corbin 
 
 
 THE STAT : Portland committed six of its 16 turnovers in the fourth quarter, including five in eight possessions down the stretch.  
 
 TURNING POINT : The Blazers led 89-80 with 7:42 to play when the Jazz cranked the defensive pressure and turned the game around. 
 
 QUOTABLE II :  "We played a good game until the turnovers caught up with us in the fourth quarter. We shot ourselves in the foot with turnovers."  
 --Portland coach  Terry Stotts 
 
 
 HOT : Williams scored 10 points in the third quarter and 16 points in the fourth after totaling two points on 1-for-5 shooting in the first half. 
 
 NOT : After seizing a nine-point lead with 7:42 left, the Blazers finished the game making only 2 of their last 8 shots from the field. 
 
 GOOD MOVE: Wesley Matthews  wasn't afraid to add another field-goal attempt to his stats, heaving a 35-foot jumper just ahead of the buzzer at the end of the first quarter. It went in, giving Portland a 30-22 lead. 
 
 QUOTABLE III : "Whether at home or on the road, we have to win from here on out if we want to make the playoffs."  
 -- Al Jefferson, on Utah snapping a nine-game road losing streak 
 
 NOTABLE :  Utah scored 63 points in the second half ? 32 in the third quarter, 31 in the fourth ? after falling behind 52-42 at halftime. ... Jefferson went scoreless the final 19 minutes of the game. ... Portland's  LaMarcus Aldridge , who injured an ankle in Wednesday's loss to Brooklyn, missed the game and will not accompany the team on a two-game trip with stops at Golden State Saturday and Utah Monday. ... Hickson notched his 39th double-double, which ranks him fifth in the league in that category. ... In Portland's first two games with Utah ? a 1-1 split ?  Lillard outscored Utah's starting point guard,  Jamaal Tinsley , 49-6. Williams was a much more formidable foe for the Blazer rookie Friday night, with five rebounds and five assists to go with his 28 points. ... Portland has made 599 3-pointers this season, breaking the franchise record of 596 set in 2008-09.
