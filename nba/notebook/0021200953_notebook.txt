 THE FACTS: Vince Carter  put on a big-shot clinic in the fourth quarter, leading the Dallas Mavericks to a 115-108 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday night at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. 
 Carter made three huge 3-pointers -- each one interrupting Milwaukee momentum -- and had 13 of his 23 points in the fourth quarter as Dallas (30-33) won its fourth straight game. 
 
 Monta Ellis  led all scorers with 32 points, but the Bucks (32-30) lost a chance to pick up ground on the teams immediately ahead of them in Eastern Conference playoff positioning. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I just felt in the groove. The basket just seemed extremely big and I felt comfortable in my shot. I was just in the flow of the game, and a couple of shots, once I let them go I happened to look down and see the 3-point line was up there. I was like, 'Oops,' because I know if I don't make them, coach is going to yell. But I had my feet set and in rhythm."

 THE STAT: Mike James  is a 37-year-old journeyman who joined the Mavericks on a 10-day contract back on Jan. 8. He's even spent a couple games in the NBA D-League this season. Yet he completely outplayed Milwaukee's  Brandon Jennings , outscoring him 13-4 and adding seven assists and six rebounds. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Bucks scored seven straight points to pull within 98-91 with 6:28 left when Carter took control and knocked down a 25-foot 3-pointer. After  J.J. Redick  pulled Milwaukee within 101-96 with 4:39 left, Carter swished a 26-footer. Finally, after Ellis got Milwaukee within 106-100 on a driving layup with 2:47 left, Carter drilled a 26-footer with 2:27 left, and the Bucks ran out of time and momentum. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Vince got hot, obviously at the right time. We had  Dirk (Nowitzki)  out of the game. He needed a blow there in the fourth quarter, and Vince hit two or three in a row that were hellacious shots." 
 
 -- Mavericks coach  Rick Carlisle 
 
 
 HOT:  Carter scored his 23 points on just 10 shots, thanks to 4-for-6 shooting behind the arc and 7-for-7 shooting from the free throw line. 
 
 NOT:  Jennings was just 2-for-7 shooting  and was never a factor in the game. He finished with four points and five assists after averaging 19.2 points and 13.6 assists in the previous five games. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Bucks center  Larry Sanders  posted his 18th double-double with 13 points and 12 rebounds and padded his league lead with four more blocks.  
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  Mavs broadcaster  Brad Davis  got a surprise on the court more than an hour before tip-off when he heard his name being called out. The person calling to him? His brother  Mickey , a Bucks player from 1972-76 who was in town as a guest of the Bucks. "I told him, 'You should have called me, I could have gotten you tickets.' He said, 'Sen.  (Herb) Kohl  (the Bucks owner) took care of it.'" Mickey Davis played in the 1974 Finals for the Bucks, who lost to the Boston Celtics in seven games. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  With Jennings struggling, Bucks coach  Jim Boylan  pulled Jennings and went with Redick and Ellis in the backcourt for the final 8:32. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Mavericks forward  Jae Crowder  started in place of injured  Shawn Marion  (bruised calf) and posted 14 points and a career-best eight rebounds. Crowder was playing in the Bradley Center for the first time as a pro after playing there four seasons with Marquette University.  
 
 NOTABLE:  Bucks forward  Luc Richard Mbah a Moute  missed the game with turf toe and was limping noticeably after the game.  Mike Dunleavy  started in his place and had 18 points and six rebounds. ... Crowder was asked before the game if he was aware that Bucks coach Jim Boylan was one of the starters on Marquette's 1977 NCAA Championship team. "Oh, wooooooooowww," Crowder said in surprise. "I did not know that. Now I'll congratulate him when I see him." ... The Bucks fell to 16-15 at home. They're also 16-15 on the road. ... Nowitzki had 19 points and 11 rebounds. ... The Bucks remained 1 ½ games behind both Atlanta and Boston for sixth and seventh in playoff positioning. ... The Dallas bench outscored Milwaukee's, 55-34.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Thursday @ San Antonio, Friday vs. Cleveland, Sunday vs. Oklahoma City. For the Bucks, Wednesday @ Washington, Friday vs. Miami, Sunday vs. Orlando.
