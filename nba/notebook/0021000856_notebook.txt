  Jazz-Mavs notebook   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday February 23, 2011 11:42PM THE FACTS:   Dirk Nowitzki  scored 23 points to lead the deep, well-balanced Mavericks to a 118-99 victory Wednesday over the shorthanded and suddenly unstable Jazz. The Mavericks have won 14 of their last 15 games and eight straight in Dallas. Utah, playing just hours after trading All-Star point guard and team captain  Deron Williams  to New Jersey, has lost five straight and 14 of 18.  Al Jefferson  tallied 30 points to lead the Jazz. QUOTABLE:  "There are no excuses because guys are out of the lineup. We've got five guys on the floor, they play with five, and those out there on the floor have got to play the whole time they're out there. We just have to be better at finishing the game."   --Jazz head coach  Tyrone Corbin , who dropped to 0-4 since taking over for  Jerry Sloan . THE STAT:  Seven players scored in double figures for the Mavericks. It was the 14th consecutive game that at least five players have registered 10 or more points, with Dallas improving to 28-4 this season in those contests. In addition to Nowitzki, the others were  Peja Stojakovic  (18),  Shawn Marion  (16),  Jason Terry  (13),  J.J. Barea  (13),  Brendan Haywood  (12) and  Rodrigue Beaubois  (10). The Mavs had a 55-22 advantage in bench points. TURNING POINT:  Not only were the Jazz without Williams and his 21.3 points and 9.7 assists per game, they didn't have the services of the two Nets acquired in the deal: point guard  Rodrigue Beaubois and rookie forward Rodrigue Beaubois .  Rodrigue Beaubois  (toe) and  Mehmet Okur  (back) were out with injuries, leading to heavy minutes for the starters. Four played at least 31 minutes, while only one Maverick (Nowitzki) logged that much court time. QUOTABLE II:  "I'm not shocked, but it's a little surprising that there wasn't a three-month drama."   --Mavericks head coach  Rick Carlisle  on the Deron Williams trade. HOT:  The Mavericks shot better than 50 percent (season-high 57.9 percent) for the fifth straight game, their longest stretch since a six-game streak from March 28-April 8, 2004. During the five-game stretch, Dallas has averaged 114.4 points and shot 54.9 percent (225-for-410) from the field. The Mavericks were 10-for-20 from behind the arc against Utah. NOT:  Dallas scored 23 points off 20 turnovers by Utah, which scored 24 points off 19 miscues by the Mavericks. Twelve different players in the game had at least two turnovers. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Replacing Williams in the starting lineup at point guard,  Earl Watson  didn't have his best night as he prepares to compete with Harris for minutes. Watson finished with seven points on 3-for-11 shooting (1-for-5 3-pointers) with five assists and four turnovers. ... Haywood also collected 10 rebounds for his second double-double of the season, while  Tyson Chandler  added 12 boards and  Jason Kidd  dished 12 assists. ROOKIE WATCH:  Jazz forward  Gordon Hayward  finished with more offensive fouls (three) than points (two). He was 1-for-6 from the field. NOTABLE:  The Mavericks are 3-0 against the Jazz this season. ... Dallas improved to 21-9 (.700) against teams with winning records this season. ... Dallas is 30-2 when it reaches the century mark and has done so in 13 of its last 14 games. ... Nowitzki (22,201) passed  Clyde Drexler  (22,195) for 23rd place on the NBA's all-time scoring list. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Saturday @ Washington, Sunday @ Toronto, Tuesday @ Philadelphia. For the Jazz, Friday @ Indiana, Saturday @ Detroit, Monday vs. Boston.
