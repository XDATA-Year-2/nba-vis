 THE FACTS: Tobias Harris  and  Arron Afflalo  each scored 16 points, leading six Orlando Magic players in double figures in a surprising 98-84 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers Tuesday night at the Wells Fargo Center.  Andrew Nicholson  scored 13 points while former Sixer  Nikola Vucevic  scored 12 points and swept 19 rebounds.  E'Twaun Moore  had 12 points and 10 assists while  Maurice Harkless  also scored 10 points. The Magic improved to 16-41 and broke a 10-game losing streak on the road. 
 
 Jeremy Pargo  and  Damien Wilkins  paced the Sixers with 14 points each.  Dorell Wright  scored 11 points and  Evan Turner  had 10 for Philadelphia, which has lost six straight games. The Sixers dropped to 22-33. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "If everyone looked inside themselves as much as I do, the world would be a CAT scan." --  Sixers coach  Doug Collins 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Sixers are 0-13 this season when the opponent shoots 50 percent or better from the field. Orlando shot 53.9 percent -- 41-for-76. Dating to the 2010-11 season, the Sixers are 0-27 when the opponent shoots 50 percent or better. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Magic began the third quarter on an 11-0 run. The Magic then opened the fourth on a 17-3 run. That eventually pushed a five-point halftime lead to 21 and provided the Magic with a stunning road win. 
 
 HOT:  Harris was 7-for-9 while Nicholson was 6-for-8. Harkless knocked down three of his four shots. 
 
 NOT:  Sixers All-Star point guard  Jrue Holiday  shot 4-for-11. So did  Thaddeus Young .  Nick Young  was 1-for-6 and  Evan Turner  was 2-for-7. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I think the guys deserved it. They put forth the kind of effort that deserved a win and that's what it's all about. At the end of the day in this league, for the most part, you get what you deserve. Tonight we had a great effort and were able to do a lot of good things and we're just getting better." 
 -- Magic coach  Jacque Vaughn 
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Vucevic had a stellar all-around game with 12 points, 19 rebounds, one assist and one blocked shot. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The crowd of 18,432 was quiet for much of the game. Down the stretch, the fans voiced their displeasure and sent boos careening from the stands after the final buzzer sounded. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "I haven't felt this energy in the locker room in a long time. It's definitely a good feeling." 
 -- Magic forward  Maurice Harkless 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Magic attacked the rim and took advantage of Philadelphia's weakness in the middle. Vucevic dominated  Lavoy Allen  and  Spencer Hawes  in just about every facet. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Sixers could have gone to Holiday more often. While his shot was off, he has the ability to get to the basket. They got away from that at times. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Nicholson scored 13 points while Harkless had 10 points and four rebounds. Forward  Kyle O'Quinn  received a DNP-CD, forward  DeQuan Jones  scored six points while guard  Doron Lamb  was scoreless in 5:43. For the Sixers, forward  Arnett Moultrie  had two points in 5:30. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Sixers haven't scored above 93 points in any of the past 11 games, the longest streak in franchise history during the shot clock era. ... Wilkins' 14 points was a season high. ... Moore's double-double for the Magic was the first of his career. ...  Thaddeus Young  has 20 rebounds and seven steals combined in the past two games. ... Holiday failed to reach double figures in scoring for just the third time this season. ... Vucevic's double-double was his 32nd of the season. ... The Sixers are 6-20 when scoring below 90 points this season. 
 
 NEXT:  For the Magic, Wednesday vs. Sacramento, Friday vs. Houston, Sunday vs. Memphis. For the Sixers, Thursday @ Chicago, Saturday vs. Golden State, Sunday @ Washington.
