 THE FACT:  The Phoenix Suns are 9-3 in the month of December.  
 
 THE LEAD:  The Philadelphia 76ers play at the NBA's fastest pace. But the Suns also prefer to play fast, and they have more horsepower than the Sixers. 
 So it was probably inevitable that the Suns were able to crack the game open. They did so in putting away the Sixers late in a 115-101 home win Saturday night. 
 
 Miles Plumlee  led the Suns (18-11) with a career-high 22 points. He also had game highs in rebounds (13) and blocks (three). 
 His stats would have been even more impressive had he not missed several minutes after he hit his chin on the floor and had to take seven stitches. 
 
 Goran Dragic  scored 21 while  Eric Bledsoe  added 20 points.  Channing Frye  had a season-high 11 boards.  
 For the Sixers,  Thaddeus Young  scored 30.  Michael Carter-Williams  had 27 points, while  Tony Wroten  added 22 points.  
 
 Evan Turner , the Sixers' leading scorer (19.3 points) missed the game with what the team called right knee soreness. This was Turner's first miss in nearly two years. He may be ready to go Sunday at the Los Angeles Lakers. 
 The Suns led 96-90 midway through the final quarter. Then they hit a trio of 3-pointers, two by  Marcus Morris  and an accidental bank shot from up top by Dragic. That made it 105-90, and the Suns were able to bring home the win. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "He's in a pretty good stretch, where he is playing hard, making quick moves. He is very confident with his moves. I think in the beginning, he kind of predetermined his moves. But in these last 10 games, he is seeing the defense, just seeing how it flows. If they want to play him on the right side, then he will go to the left-hand hook. If they want to play him on the other side, he will drive right. We don't have anywhere near our record without him."  
 -- Suns coach  Jeff Hornacek  on Plumlee 
 
 
 THE STAT:  After winning their first game on the road, the Sixers have lost 13 straight away from Philadelphia.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Sixers led 65-60 early in the third quarter, when Plumlee scored on a layup, then -- moments later -- on a 3-point play down low. Frye scored on up post-up move, Bledsoe hit a 3-pointer, then Frye scored down low again. The Suns had gone on 12-2 run, good for a 72-67 lead. The Sixers never got closer than three points. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I am happy with my progress. I feel better every game. I feel like I have more energy because I'm not as anxious on the court. I just feel like I can play harder."  
 -- Miles Plumlee  
 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "He's a pretty skilled big guy. He protects our rim, and he's a great rebounder. Without him, we're struggling. He's a huge part of this team. If he plays like this every game, it will be tough to beat us."  
 -- Goran Dragic on Plumlee 
 
 
 HOT:  Plumlee shot 10-for-14. 
 
 NOT: Elliot Williams  and  Hollis Thompson , the Sixers' starting off guard and small forward, combined to shoot 2-for-13. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  For the Sixers, Carter-Williams shot 12-for-28 for 27 points. He also had six rebounds, six assists, four steals and five turnovers.  Brandon Davies  had one rebound, one assist and three fouls in eight minutes. Thompson shot 2-for-8 for four points and had six boards and four assists in 35 minutes. 
 For the Suns,  Archie Goodwin  had four points in six minutes. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Over his past six games, Plumlee has averaged 12.2 points on 60 percent shooting plus 12.3 rebounds. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Hornacek played in 132 games for the Sixers over parts of two seasons, from 1992-94, before heading to Utah. He was part of one of the Suns' biggest trades ever. Along with  Andrew Lang  and  Tim Perry , he was dealt to Philadelphia for  Charles Barkley . For the Sixers, he averaged 18.1 points, 6.5 assists and 4.2 rebounds....The game was sloppy: the Suns had 21 turnovers while the Sixers, who lead the NBA in turnovers at 17.9 per game, had 20...The Suns, who lead the NBA in fast-break points (18.7), had 31 vs. the Sixers. Philadelphia had 14 fast-break points. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the 76ers, Sunday @ L.A. Lakers, Wedensday @ Denver and Thursday @ Sacramento. For the Suns, Monday at L.A. Clippers, Thursday vs. Memphis and Saturday vs. Milwaukee.
