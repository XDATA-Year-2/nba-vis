  Notebook: Nuggets 108, Wizards 104   By Rich Dubroff, for NBA.com Posted Friday January 20, 2012 11:42PM THE FACTS:   Al Harrington  had a season-high 29 points,  Ty Lawson  and  Danilo Gallinari  each added 21 as the Denver Nuggets, playing without injured forward  Nene , beat the Washington Wizards 108-104 on Friday night. Harrington was 5-for-8 from 3-point range and shot 5-for-8 on 2-pointers, too. He scored 27 in the final three quarters. Lawson had 19 in the last three. It was the Nuggets' fifth win in six games. Washington, which lost for the 13th time in 15 games, was led by  Nick Young's  25 points.  Jordan Crawford  had 18, and  John Wall  narrowly missed his second career triple-double with 13 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds. QUOTABLE:  "I think that's probably who we'll be for most of the year. Sometimes you piece it together throughout the game."   -- Denver coach  George Karl  on having a different player lead the team in scoring each night over the past five games. THE STAT:  Harrington has averaged 29 points in his last three games in Washington, and is 16-for-24 on 3-pointers in those games. TURNING POINT:   Arron Aflalo  scored on a layup with 2:07 remaining to give the Nuggets the lead. Harrington hit a 3-pointer with 1:14 left to put Denver up 103-98. QUOTABLE II:  "We have a great defensive sequence, and they throw it out to him at 30 feet, and he throws it in at the buzzer."   -- Wizards coach  Flip Saunders  on Harrington's 3-pointers beating the 24-second clock. . HOT:  Harrington, the 14-year-veteran, who'll turn 32 next month, shooting those 3s, and then adding an uncontested dunk with 7.2 seconds left to secure the win. NOT:   Andray Blatche,  who's obviously bothered by the booing from the Verizon Center crowd, missed all seven of his field goals. Even though Wall's line looked good, he was just 4-for-17 from the field. GOOD MOVE:  Karl running plays for Harrington, and his teammates looking for him. The 23-year NBA coach rested Nene with a bruised right heel. He expects him back on Saturday when the Nuggets come to call on  Carmelo Anthony  for the first time as a Knick. BAD MOVE:  Blatche and  JaVale McGee  picked up five fouls each. McGee was twice called for goaltending in the second half. NOTABLE:  Without Nene, their leading rebounder, the 5-foot-11 Lawson had a career-high nine boards. IN THE ARENA:  The announced attendance was 14,866. For a team that's 2-7 at home, that's not bad. Washington has drawn at least that many five times. NEXT:  Nuggets: Saturday @ Knicks, Wednesday @  Kings, Friday vs. Raptors. Wizards: Sunday vs. Celtics, Monday @ Sixers, Wednesday vs. Bobcats.
