
 Hawks-Magic notebook   By Dick Scanlon, for NBA.com Posted Monday November 8, 2010 10:53PM THE FACTS:   Vince Carter  scored five of the Orlando Magic's final seven points as they held off the Atlanta Hawks, 93-89, to move into first place in the Southeast Division. Carter and  Dwight Howard  (27 points, 11 rebounds) played most of the game in foul trouble for Orlando.  Joe Johnson  scored 23 points for the Hawks, who didn't fall behind for good until  Jason Williams  nailed a 3-pointer with 4:15 remaining. QUOTABLE:  "We wanted to show the Orlando Magic that we could come in and make a game of it, and not just hand them the game."    -   Josh Smith  of the Hawks, who had lost their five preceding games in Orlando by an average of 26.2 points. THE STAT:  The Magic bench outscored the Hawks bench, 35-24; and led by Williams' eight (one short of his career high), the Orlando bench had a 22-16 rebound edge. TURNING POINT:  The Hawks made nine of their first 11 shots and led by 13 points early, but Carter and  Marcin Gortat  combined for 10 Magic points on an 11-0 run to close out the first quarter. HOT:  All five Hawks starters hit shots as they opened the game 9-for-11 and led, 19-6. NOT:  Normally a strong and deep 3-point shooting team, the Magic went 4-for-22 from behind the arc Monday night and are shooting only .323 for the season. QUOTABLE II:  "I know we're going to shoot the ball well at some point. I know these guys are not 0-for-5, 0-for-4, 0-for-3 guys on a nightly basis from three (point range). But if we're going to continue to fight that hard even when the shots aren't falling, then we have a chance to be really good."     -- Magic coach  Stan Van Gundy NOTABLE:  The Hawks shot .474 overall and lead the NBA in field goal percentage (.498) . . . Howard made only 16-of-37 free throws (.432) in his first three games. In his last three games he went 25-for-37 (.676). UP NEXT:  For the Hawks, Wednesday vs. Milwaukee, Friday vs. Utah, Sunday vs. Minnesota. For the Magic, Wednesday vs. Utah, Friday vs. Toronto, Saturday @ New Jersey.
