  Notebook: Magic 117, Raptors 101  Posted Monday March 26, 2012 10:40PM By Duane Watson, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  The Orlando Magic (32-18) defeated the Toronto Raptors (16-34) 117-101 at the Air Canada Centre on Monday night, giving them their third win in a row. The Magic started the game on a 22-8 run, nine of those points came from NBA 3-point league leader  Ryan Anderson  who scored a game high 28 points. The Magic never trailed and had as much as a 23 point lead in the game shooting .543 from the field and .441 on 15-for-34 shooting from the 3-point line. But their presence was just as strong inside, outscoring the Raptors 46-24 in the paint.  Dwight Howard  added 23 points and 10 rebounds, while  Jameer Nelson  had 18 points and 7 assists. The Raptors were led by  Gary Forbes  in his second start of the season, replacing injured guard  DeMar DeRozan  (ankle), who had a career high 21 points and a career high with 3-pointers made and attempted shooting 4-for-7.  Linas Kleiza  came off the bench to pour in 18 points, while  Jose Calderon  had 9 points and 11 assists. The Raptors started a five game homestand tonight and are now 8-16 at home, this is their second loss in a row. QUOTABLE:  "I had a lot of open looks, I think everybody did a good job of finding me. Dwight caused a lot of attention in the paint which led to some open shots for everybody. We started the game off rolling and made a ton of threes and hit some open shots and we really moved the ball tonight."    -- Magic forward  Ryan Anderson THE STAT:  The Orlando Magic lead the league in 3-pointers made per game with10.2 and attempted with 26.7. They were well over their averages tonight shooting 15-for-34 making .441 per cent. The Raptors shot only .473 from the field as a whole. TURNING POINT:  Orlando dominated the game from the opening tip and reeled off 10 unanswered points to start the game. While the Raptors made runs, no Magic lead was ever in jeopardy. HOT:  Anderson started the game with 18 points in the first half on 6-for-10 shooting. All of his baskets came from behind the 3-point line and only one of his attempts was from inside the arc. He finished the game with a career high eight 3-pointers and 28 points, well over his season average of 15.9 and the 21.6 points per game average in his two previous meetings with the Raptors. Anderson leads the league in 3-point shots made (143) and attempted (344). NOT:   Andrea Bargnani  only scored 8 points on 3-for-11 shooting and was a non-factor for the Raptors. Over the past 5 games, he's been averaging 14.4 points and shooting .314 from the field and .111 from the 3-point line. Down from his team-leading scoring average of 19.3 points per game while shooting .421 from the field. GOOD MOVE:  After taking 24-8 beating fast and early in the first quarter, Raptors head coach  Dwane Casey  emptied his bench. His team responded with an 18-4 run to close out the quarter down one basket 28-26. NOTABLE:  Orlando sweeps the season series (3-0) between the two clubs for the second time... The Magic are 22-5 when making 10 or more three-pointers... Toronto was .500 from beyond the arc... The Raptors 11 made three-pointers was a regulation time season-high... The Magic scored an opponent high 117 points.. Orlando's 44 field goals were also a season best... The Magic are 21-3 this season when scoring 100+ points...  Jerryd Bayless  left the game in the second quarter re-inuring a hip pointer that forced him to miss the last two games and didn't return... Howard recorded his 41st double-double...  Glen Davis  was cut on the head during the second quarter and went to the locker room for five stitches... The 61 first half points by the Magic equaled an opponent season high for points in a half.. The Raptors signed  Alan Anderson  from the D-League's Canton Charge to a 10-day contract 2 hours before the game, he suited up and scored 2 points in 7 minutes. UP NEXT:  Toronto continues their homestand Wednesday vs. Nuggets, Friday vs. Miami and Sunday vs. Washington. Orlando @ New York on Wednesday, vs. Dallas on Friday and @ Detroit on Tuesday.
