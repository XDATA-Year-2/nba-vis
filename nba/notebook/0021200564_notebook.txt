 THE FACTS:   Greivis Vasquez  scored 23 points and added nine assists while  Eric Gordon  continued his strong play with 19 points as the New Orleans Hornets shot 53 percent in a lopsided 111-99 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers Tuesday night at the Wells Fargo Center.  Ryan Anderson  (14 points) and  Xavier Henry  (11) combined for 25 huge points off the bench while  Anthony Davis  chipped in with 10 points and seven rebounds for the Hornets, who improved to 12-26. 
 
 Jrue Holiday  once again played at an All-Star level with 29 points and 11 assists while  Nick Young  and  Evan Turner  scored 14 points apiece. All of Young's points came in the fourth quarter.  Thaddeus Young  had 12 points for the Sixers, who fell to 16-23. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "To come out of halftime with that kind of energy, we haven't been a team that's done that consistently, so I'm not sure we had control of the game. But I thought we played pretty well." 
 -- Hornets coach  Monty Williams 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Sixers allowed at least 10 made 3-pointers for the 10th time this season. In Philadelphia's 23 losses, opponents are averaging 7.8 3-pointers made per game compared to 5.8 in its 16 victories. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  After building a 53-47 lead at halftime, the Hornets proceeded to outscore the Sixers 33-21 in the third quarter. It was more than enough of an advantage on this night. 
 
 HOT:  Vasquez was 10-for-18 while Gordon was 7-for-13. The Hornets were 44-for-83 overall and 10-for-18 from beyond the arc. 
 
 NOT:   Thaddeus Young  missed 12 of his 18 shots and  Spencer Hawes  was 2-for-6 for the reeling Sixers. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We couldn't get any stops. They outran us. They outrebounded us. They beat us in the paint. They out-executed us. They beat us in every way they possibly could." 
 -- Sixers coach  Doug Collins 
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Vasquez had 23 points, nine assists and two rebounds. For the Sixers, Holiday registered his 10th double-double with 29 points, 11 assists, five rebounds and four steals. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  There was a lively crowd of 17,304 at the Wells Fargo Center. When the Hornets extended their lead to 20 in the second half, boos began careening all around the arena. When the final buzzer sounded, those boos were quite evident, too. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "I thought we started off sloppy in the third quarter, but they weren't making shots, so that was the good thing for us. But I thought we played with a lot of energy and then we started hitting shots and we started getting into our offense." 
 -- Vasquez. 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Hornets shot well from the perimeter but they also attacked the rim with ferocity the entire game. Since the Sixers don't have much protection in the middle, it was a wise decision to drive the lane. That opened up shots from beyond the arc the entire game. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Nick Young  sparked the Sixers with 14 points in the fourth, but he probably could have been inserted in the game earlier in the second half. He's shaky on defense but he can score in bunches as he proved. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Davis had 10 points and seven rebounds while guard Austin Rivers had one point, one rebound and one assist in 5:18 for the Hornets. Guard  Brian Roberts  gave the Hornets a big lift with seven points in 6:40. For the Sixers, guard  Maalik Wayns  and forward  Arnett Moultrie  each received a DNP-CD. 
 
 NOTABLE:  In the first quarter, the Hornets were red hot, going 16-for-21 from the field. ... The Sixers have allowed at least 110 points for the fifth time this season. ... The Sixers fell to 0-8 when opponents shoot 50 percent or better and have dropped 22 in a row dating to 2010-11. ... Over the past 17 games, Vasquez is averaging 17.3 points, 10.2 assists and 5.1 rebounds. ...  Nick Young  scored at least 10 points in the fourth quarter for the third time this season. ... The Hornets had 22 fast break points while holding the Sixers to just 14. 
 
 NEXT:  For the Hornets, Wednesday @ Boston, Saturday vs. Golden State, Monday vs. Sacramento. For the Sixers, Friday vs. Toronto, Monday vs. San Antonio, Tuesday @ Milwaukee.
