  Notebook: Bucks 116, Blazers 87 Posted Wednesday March 21, 2012 1:17AM By Kerry Eggers, for NBA.com THE FACTS:   Drew Gooden  scored 19 points to lead six Milwaukee players in double figures as the Bucks (21-24) earned their sixth straight victory with their most one-sided road win of the season, 116-87 over the Trail Blazers. Milwaukee led 54-43 at the half and continued to extend its advantage through a 62-point second half. The Bucks shot a season-high .578 from the field -- .634 in the second half -- and were 11-for-21 (.524) from 3-point range to spoil the home debut for Portland interim coach  Kaleb Canales .  LaMarcus Aldridge  (21 points, 12 rebounds),  Wesley Matthews  (21 points, a season-high nine boards) and  Raymond Felton  (18 points, nine assists) had productive offensive games for Portland (21-25), which shot .354 from the field and committed 20 turnovers. QUOTABLE:  "We passed the ball well, we shot the ball well and played pretty good defense. Our only issue was rebounding, but we were able to build a big enough lead, pull away and really take control."    -- Milwaukee coach  Scott Skiles . THE STAT:  Milwaukee's bench outscored its Portland counterparts 45-9. TURNING POINT:  Portland was within 58-49 early in the second half when Milwaukee went on a 13-0 run to seize a 71-49 advantage. It was pretty much garbage time the rest of the way. HOT:  Gooden was on fire in the first half, making 8-for-10 shots from the field en route to 17 points by intermission. NOT:  Portland's reserves missed their first 23 shots from the field. They finished 2-for-29. QUOTABLE II:  "Everybody's out there having fun, sharing the ball. With the offense we have, if you pass the ball, you're going to get it back."    -- Milwaukee guard  Monta Ellis  after the Bucks passed out 35 assists. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Former Blazer great  Brandon Roy , who retired after last season, made his first appearance back at the Rose Garden. Roy and wife  Tiana  were on hand to help Blazer guard and good friend  Jamal Crawford  celebrate his 32nd birthday. GOOD MOVE:  Skiles used 6-foot-6 small forward  Carlos Delfino  to defend Crawford, Portland's 6-foot-5 combo guard. Crawford made only 1-for-8 shots from the field. BAD MOVE:  Canales showed faith in his reserves, using his second five for extended minutes in both halves. They rewarded him with some of their most ugly ball of the season. QUOTABLE III:  "We have to do more, no question about it. When the starters are in and they have the lead, we have to either maintain it or make it grow. We have to get back on track."    -- Portland's Jamal Crawford, on Blazers reserves combining to make 2-for-29 shots from the field. NOTABLE:  Matthews, who had made his previous seven 3-point attempts entering the game, sank his first four Tuesday night to become the first NBA player to knock down 11 straight since Washnington's  Mike Miller  in February 2010. UP NEXT:  For the Blazers, Thursday vs. Memphis, Friday at L.A. Lakers, Sunday vs. Golden State. For the Bucks, Thursday vs. Boston, Friday at Charlotte, Saturday vs. Indiana.
