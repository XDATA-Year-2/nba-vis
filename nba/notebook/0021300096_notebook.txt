 THE FACT: Jeff Hornacek  became the first Suns' coach, out of 16, to win his first four home games. Those who won their first three were  Jerry Colangelo  (1969-70),  John Wetzel  ('87-88),  Paul Westphal  ('92-93) and  Scott Skiles  ('99-00). 
 
 THE LEAD:  The Phoenix Suns are hoping  Markieff Morris  has finally figured out the NBA game. 
 Morris, highly inconsistent -- at best -- during his first two seasons, continued his recent surge in helping the Suns break open a close game and down the visiting New Orleans Pelicans, 101-94, Sunday night. 
 The surprising Suns moved to 5-2, including two wins over New Orleans, while the Pelicans dropped to 3-4.  
 With the Suns holding a tenuous 80-79 with less than 6:00 left, Morris hit a 19-foot jumper then dunked to spark the Suns to a 15-6 run that put the game away. 
 Morris finished with 23 points, five rebounds and zero turnovers. 
 "He's good offensively; he's good defensively," Hornacek said. "Defensively, he he has been much better than he has in the past.  
 "He has both parts going." 
 Morris has averaged 23.8 points the past four games. Morris, picked by the Suns ahead of such NBA mainstays as  Kawhi Leonard  and  Nikola Vucevic , has been had a few hot streaks before but hasn't sustained it. 
 "I'm more efficient," Morris said. "You get two or three moves and master them, that's how you become more efficient." 
 In addition, "My first two years, I couldn't play without fouling. I've become a student of the game."  
 
 Eric Bledsoe  led the Suns with 24 points, plus six assists and four rebounds, though he also had five turnovers. 
 The Suns did a good job on blossoming star  Anthony Davis  (5-for-13 for 14 points plus 12 rebounds) but center  Jason Smith  broke free for 22 points on 9-for-12 shooting.  
 Early on, so sloppy was the game that late in the first half, the Pelicans had committed 10 turnovers and had zero free throws yet led in the final minute of the half before the Suns pushed ahead 42-38 at the break. 
 The Pelicans pulled into a 65-65 tie late in the third quarter, then the Suns scored six straight to take a 71-65 lead heading into the final quarter. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I don't think they played that well. The players don't think they played that well. But we scored 101 points and got a win."  --  Hornacek on the Suns. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Suns missed their first 10 3-pointers, then hit 7-for-12, including a trio of late 3's to break the game open.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  Leading just 80-79 midway through the final quarter, the Suns went on a 15-6 run to open up a 95-85 lead with 1:25 left. Morris scored the first two baskets, then  Gerald Green ,  Goran Dragic  and Bledsoe hit 3-pointers. Bledsoe also banked in a 20-footer during the spree. "A couple of those shots, you'd say, 'Shoot 'em,'" Pelicans coach  Monty Williams  said. "They hit some tough shots." 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Maybe a little bit."  --  Hornacek on whether he's been surprised by the Suns' hugely surprising start. 
 
 
 HOT:  Morris shot 9-for-12. 
 
 NOT:  Outside of  Anthony Morrow  (7-for-11 for 16 points), the Pelicans' reserves combined to shoot 2-for-15. 
 
 IN THE ARENA:  The crowd of perhaps 7,000 to 8,000 (official attendance was announced at a season-low 13,154) could have been the smallest since the building opened in 1992. A NASCAR race and an NFL game were being playing in the Valley of the Sun on Sunday.  
 
 ROOKIE WATCH: Archie Goodwin  shot 3-for-8 for six points plus four rebounds and three blocks in 22 minutes. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Morris has shot 30-for-38 the past three games. According to the Suns, he is only the third player in the NBA since 1991 to notch three straight games of shooting at least .750 on at least 12 attempts ( Charles Barkley  in November, '91 and  Dwight Howard  in February, 2008). 
 
 NOTABLE:  Dragic returned to action for the Suns after missing three games with an ankle sprain. He shot 4-for-9 for 12 points in 30 minutes. He hit a 3-pointer with 2:30 left to give the Suns a decisive 92-84 lead.  
 "I am in good shape; no problems with the lungs," Dragic said. "But I would say I am about 90 to 95 percent on the ankle." 
 "We need Goran," Bledsoe said. "Both of us can make plays." 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Pelicans, Tuesday @ Los Angeles Lakers, vs. Wednesday @ Utah and Saturday vs. 76ers. For the Suns, Wednesday @ Portland, Friday vs. Nets and Tuesday, Nov. 19 @ Sacramento.
