 THE FACTS: Josh Smith  punished the Dallas Mavericks inside and out and powered the Atlanta Hawks to a rare road victory Monday. He went 4-for-5 on 3-pointers and finished with a game-high 26 points, 13 rebounds and six assists in a 105-101 Hawks win over the Mavs.  Al Horford  added 21 points and 10 boards and  Jeff Teague  had 20 points and nine assists for the Hawks (28-22), who won for just the second time in their last 10 road games. 
 
 Dirk Nowitzki  scored 24 to lead six players in double figures for the Mavericks (22-29).  O.J. Mayo  added 19 points, but was just 2-for-7 in the fourth quarter and committed two of his four turnovers in the critical closing seconds.  Darren Collison  contributed 14 points and 10 assists and  Vince Carter  had 13 points off the Dallas bench. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "This was probably one of the biggest wins for us this year, coming into an arena that is very tough to play in. ... For the most part, we did an excellent job of executing our game plan and our strategy of trying to keep them off balance as best we can." 
 --Hawks coach  Larry Drew 
 
 
 THE STAT : The Hawks are 11-2 when Smith and Horford both have double-doubles. They were a combined 20-for-29 from the field. 
 
 TURNING POINT: Elton Brand  stole the ball from Smith with 30 seconds remaining and Dallas down 99-98. Mayo pushed it downcourt and appeared to be setting up his shot when  Devin Harris  picked his pocket from behind. After Smith sank two free throws to make it 101-98 with 22.2 seconds left, Mayo coughed it up again. His pass to Carter at the top of the key was way off the mark and intercepted by Teague, who then converted two clutch free throws for a five-point lead. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "We've just got to learn from these things and get better -- and we have gotten better. But we haven't broken the threshold that's going to make us a team that can really become a dangerous team. I think we're a dangerous team. I think we can beat anybody on any given night, but the consistency has got to be better." 
 --Mavericks coach  Rick Carlisle 
 
 
 HOT : Carter drained his first four shots from 3-point distance and finished 4-for-5. Nowitzki was 3-for-4 behind the arc, becoming the 29th player in NBA history with 1,300 career 3-pointers. 
 
 NOT : The Mavericks shot 33.3 percent (7-for-21) with four turnovers during the fourth quarter. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT : In addition to the double-double, Horford added three steals, two blocked shots and two assists to fill up the stat sheet. 
 
 NOTABLE : Mavericks center  Chris Kaman  (concussion) missed his seventh straight game. ...  Kyle Korver  extended his streak to 44 consecutive games with at least one 3-pointer, the longest in Hawks history and the longest active streak in the NBA. ... Atlanta guard  DeShawn Stevenson  played on the Mavericks' 2011 championship team. Harris played for Dallas from 2004-08. ... The Hawks are 23-1 when they lead entering the fourth quarter and 21-5 when they register 24 or more assists (26). ... The Mavericks took their first lead of the game with 11:10 left in the fourth quarter. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Mavericks, Wednesday vs. Sacramento, Feb. 20 vs. Orlando, Feb. 22 @ New Orleans. For the Hawks, Wednesday @ Orlando, Feb. 20 vs. Miami, Feb. 22 vs. Sacramento.
