  Bulls-Hawks notebook   By Jon Cooper, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday March 23, 2011 12:32AM THE FACTS:  This time the Chicago Bulls made sure. Chicago, which blew a 19-point lead the last time it was in Atlanta, never let its foot off the gas on Tuesday night, handing out a resounding 114-81 thrashing of the Hawks at Philips Arena. The rout came one night after a 40-point walloping of the Kings, 132-92.  Derrick Rose  led the Bulls with 30 points and 10 assists.  Luol Deng  chipped in 25 for Chicago, which led the by 10 after one quarter, 29 at the half and by as much as 47 midway through the final quarter. Jeff Teague  led the Hawks with 20, but 17 of his points came in the fourth quarter when the game was out of reach.  Josh Smith  and  Al Horford  each had 14 and  Joe Johnson  had 13. None of them saw the floor in the final stanza. The game was close for the first nine minutes, but Chicago ended the first quarter on an 11-2 run to take a 31-21 lead after one quarter then pulled away. The win ended a six-game losing streak at Philips Arena and moved the Bulls (51-19) into sole possession of first place in the Eastern Conference by a half-game over idle Boston. The Hawks (40-31) fell to 4-7 on the month, 4-5 at home. They still hold fifth place in the East by 3 1/2 games over Philadelphia, where they play tomorrow night. QUOTABLE:  "What happened the last time we were here was definitely on our mind. We knew once we got the lead that we couldn't let that happen again."    -- Rose on Tuesday night's blowout. The Bulls are 10-1 since the March 2 loss at Philips Arena. THE STAT:  73.8 -- Chicago shot the lights out Tuesday night, shooting a blazing 73.8 percent from the floor in the first half. They weren't all layups either, as the Bulls shot 77.8 percent (7-for-9) from three-point territory. Through three quarters, the Bulls were still scoring at 62.5 percent -- 66.7 from three -- as they took a 98-60 lead into the final 12 minutes before cruising home. TURNING POINT:  Chicago went on a 22-6 run over the final 3:10 of the first quarter and first 2:34 of the second to turn a 20-19 game into a 42-25 rout. Atlanta never got closer the rest of the way. Deng had 10 points in the run and Rose and  C.J. Watson  each dished out three assists. QUOTABLE II:  "It's starting to get embarrassing. We're too good a team to be getting blown out of our own gym."    -- Josh Smith on the Hawks' 37-point loss. It's the Hawks' fourth home loss by at least 30 points. HOT:  The Bulls shot a sizzling 81.0 percent in the second quarter to turn the game into a laugher. Deng, Rose, Boozer,  Taj Gibson , Watson and  Omer Asik  were a combined 15-for-16. Rose was 4-for-4, including 3-for-3 from downtown, Watson was 3-for-3, Gibson was 2-for-2, Asik was 1-for-1, and Deng was 3-for-4.  Kyle Korver  shot 2-for-5 in those 12 minutes. NOT:  Hawks' key subs  Jamal Crawford ,  Zaza Pachulia ,  Damien Wilkins  and  Josh Powell  were a combined 1-for-11.  Kirk Hinrich  also was 0-for-3. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Rose circled the date of March 22 shortly after the meltdown on March 2. He certainly showed up, scoring a game-high 30 points on 11-for-15 shooting, including 6-for-8 from three. The six three-pointers are a career-high. He also dished out 10 assists. INSIDE THE ARENA:   Julius "Dr. J" Erving , former Hawk  Kevin Willis  and comedian  Rickey Smiley  were in the house for this laugher. GOOD MOVE:  Chicago coach  Tom Thibodeau 's strategy of establishing  Carlos Boozer  in the paint worked on several fronts, as the Bulls power forward chalked up an assist and a basket on the first two possessions to free up the outside game for Deng and Rose as well as getting two early fouls on Hawks shot-blocker Josh Smith. NOTABLE:  Chicago dominated the paint, outscoring Atlanta 48-18 and holding a 23-6 edge in second-chance points. The Bulls shut out the Hawks in both categories in the second half. ... Atlanta led for a total of :33 Tuesday night and led Chicago for a total 1:02.4 seconds in the two games at Philips Arena ... Rose and Deng combined for 16 first-half field goals. Atlanta's whole team had 17. UP NEXT:  For the Hawks, Wednesday @ Philadelphia, Saturday @ New Jersey, Sunday @ Cleveland. For the Bulls, Friday vs. Memphis, Saturday @ Milwaukee, Monday vs. Philadelphia.
