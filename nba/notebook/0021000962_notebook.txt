  Pistons-Spurs notebook   By Tim Price, for NBA.com Posted Thursday March 10, 2011 12:53AM THE FACTS:  San Antonio rode an 80-percent shooting performance in the first half to a playoff-clinching 111-104 victory over the Pistons on Wednesday at AT&T Center.  Tony Parker  shot 11-for-15 for 23 points for the Spurs (52-12), who rebounded from the nationally televised thumping at the hands of the Lakers over the weekend. The Pistons (23-42) did rally from a 19-point deficit, but they are 2-6 since the All-Star break. QUOTABLE:  "I've been in the business a long time, and I've never seen a team shoot 80 percent. That was incredible. I thought that was the difference in the game, the first quarter 40-26 (with the Spurs leading)."    -- Pistons coach  John Kuester THE STAT:  The Spurs hit their first 14 shots, and their first-quarter shooting percentage of 81 percent (17-for-21) easily was a season-best for a single quarter. After matching their season-high of 40 points in the first quarter, they finished the first half shooting 80 percent (28-of-35) -- another season best. TURNING POINT:  On their way to hitting their opening 14 shots, the Spurs went to the fastbreak quickly after tipoff. They converted on all six fast-break opportunities in the first quarter. Four came in the opening 3 1/2 minutes of the game when  Manu Ginobili  stole a pass from  Tracy McGrady  and took it in for a layup, and San Antonio was up 14-2. The Pistons managed to cut the lead to five points with two minutes left in the game, but they could not get over the hump. QUOTABLE II:  "I can feel it in my body that it is 1,000 games. To actually play my 1,000th game against my old team definitely feels good."    -- Spurs center  Antonio McDyess , who played in his 1,000th NBA game HOT:  San Antonio cooled off after halftime (dropping from 80 percent from the floor to a season-high 64 percent at game's end), but their starters were extra efficient by going 32-for-45 for 71 percent. NOT:  With McGrady getting the start in the backcourt after missing five games (he was sent to the bench after he missed a shootaround and blamed it on a headache),  Rodney Stuckey  moved back to the bench. He went 1-for-5 in almost 16 minutes and is 9-for-23 in his past two games (McGrady was 6-for-11 with nine assists and seven rebounds). FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:   Tim Duncan  rebounded from his 1-for-7 performance for two points against the Lakers. This time he went 6-for-9 for 15 points and 12 rebounds, his 22nd double-double of the season. INSIDE THE ARENA:   Michael Finley , who played nearly three seasons with the Spurs before asking for a release last season and finishing the year in Boston, took in the game. GOOD MOVE:  Perhaps getting McGrady back in the starting lineup. After missing those five games -- presumably as punishment for missing a shootaround and blaming it on a headache -- McGrady started in the backcourt with  Ben Gordon  and had  two steals and a blocked shot to go along with his near triple-double in 35 1/2 minutes. BAD MOVE:  When the Spurs went up by 19 points in the first half, and even 14 with eight minutes to go, it looked like the Spurs would get to a point where they could remove their starters and get some rest. But Duncan, Parker and Ginobili each played more than 30 minutes and still were at it until 30 seconds left in the game. ROOKIE WATCH:   Gary Neal  scored 15 points (4-for-5 shooting, 6-for-6 from the foul line in almost 24 minutes). It was his 10th consecutive game with double figures, and all came in his reserve role. NOTABLE:  To commemorate McDyess' 1,000th game (though  Gregg Popovich  said the milestone had nothing to do with it), Popovich gave McDyess his first start this season, going on the floor first in place of  DeJuan Blair . It's the fourth starting lineup combination for San Antonio this season (Detroit has 16). ... The Pistons are 0-18 when entering the fourth quarter trailing on the road. ... Duncan had a blocked shot, and that broke a tie with  Robert Parish  for ninth all-time with 2,362. He needs 180 more to catch  Tree Rollins  for eighth. UP NEXT:  For the Pistons, Friday @ Oklahoma City, Saturday @ Denver, Wednesday vs. Toronto. For the Spurs, Friday vs. Sacramento, Saturday @ Houston, Monday @ Miami.
