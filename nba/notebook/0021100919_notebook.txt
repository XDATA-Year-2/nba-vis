  Notebook: Bulls 100, Bobcats 68 Posted Wednesday April 18, 2012 10:27PM By Derek S. Smith, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  The Chicago Bulls bounced back from a disappointing loss Monday with a 100-68 thrashing of the Charlotte Bobcats Wednesday night at Time Warner Cable Arena.  Richard Hamilton  led the Bulls with 22 points. The Bobcats, who dropped their 18th straight, were led by  Kemba Walker 's 16 points. QUOTABLE:  "We had a lot of guys playing well tonight. Carlos (Boozer) got us started on the inside and Rip (Hamilton) did it from the outside. We took care of the ball and hit the board hard too which always makes things happen for us."  - - Chicago coach  Tom Thibodeau THE STAT:  The Bobcats are on a franchise-worst 18-game losing streak. Charlotte is the fifth team since the 2000-01 season to lose 18 straight games in a single season. The Bobcats are being outscored 102.2-86.7 during the losing streak. Charlotte is currently last in the league in scoring (87.2 ppg) and point differential (-13.6 ppg). The Bobcats have lost 21 games this season by at least 20 points and dropped nine by at least 30 points. No other NBA team has more than four losses by 30 or more this season. TURNING POINT:  The Bulls used an 11-4 run midway through the third quarter to sap what little energy was in Time Warner Cable Arena. Charlotte had pulled within 12 after a dunk by  Derrick Brown , but  Carlos Boozer  responded with a dunk that started that run.  C.J. Watson  capped the run with a three with 4:15 to play in the quarter and the Bulls never trailed by less than 18 the rest of the way. HOT:  Let 'er Rip. The Bulls started the game on a hot streak thanks in part to Hamilton's shooting. The Bulls guard scored 12 of his game-best 22 points in the first quarter on 5-of-5 shooting from the floor and 2-of-2 shooting from behind the arc. Hamilton finished the night 9-of-13 from the floor with four threes and added six assists to his stat line. He's scored 22 in back-to-back games and has 20 or more in three of his last five. The 22 points is a season high for Hamilton. NOT:   Byron Mullens . The Bobcats big man had just nine points in the loss to Chicago on 3-of-11 shooting. Since scoring a career-high 31 points on March 6, Mullens is averaging 6.5 points and shooting 30.8 percent (16-of-52). INSIDE THE ARENA:  The Bobcats had three North Carolinians who advanced to the Hollywood round of American Idol,  Ariel Sprague ,  David Leathers, Jr.  and  Brittany Kerr,  perform at halftime. ROOKIE WATCH:  Walker scored a team-high 16 points and also led the Bobcats in assists with five. He's recorded double figures in nine of the last 11 games. He is averaging 13.8 points, 4.9 assists and 4.2 rebounds during the 11-game stretch. NOTABLE:  Bobcats guard  Gerald Henderson  scored in double figures for the 18th time in 22 games. He is averaging 15.7 points during that stretch ... Brown is averaging 11.2 points in his last 11 games on 52.0 percent shooting ... The six turnovers by Charlotte was a season low ... The 57 Chicago rebounds was the most allowed by the Bobcats all season. The Bulls have grabbed 50 or more rebounds a league-high 21 times ...  Omer Asik  grabbed a season-best 15 rebounds against Charlotte ... Boozer was in double figures for the 52nd time in 62 games ... Chicago is the only undefeated team in the league when scoring 100 or more (21-0). They are also 28-1 when holding an opponent under 90 points. UP NEXT:  For the Bulls, Thursday at Miami, Saturday vs. Dallas, Wednesday at Indiana. For the Bobcats, Friday vs. Memphis, Sunday vs. Sacramento, Monday at Washington.
