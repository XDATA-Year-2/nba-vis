  Notebook: Bucks 102, Pistons 93   By Rick Braun, for NBA.com Posted Thursday January 12, 2012 11:40PM THE FACTS:   Brandon Jennings  scored 27 points, and  Stephen Jackson  added 25 points, six rebounds and six assists to lead the Milwaukee Bucks to a 102-93 victory over the Detroit Pistons Thursday night at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee. QUOTABLE:  "He's a good all-around player. If you watch him, rarely does he try to do too much. He stays within himself. He's a one- or two-dribble guy who doesn't normally take off and get himself in trouble. He can make those high-low passes. Anyone who can make a shot as a big guy is a dangerous player because people have to respect you and then you're able to do some other things. He also did have a couple of nice drives as well."   -- Bucks coach  Scott Skiles  on rookie  Jon Leuer , who made his first start and posted 15 points, six rebounds, five assists and two blocked shots THE STAT:  The Bucks made 11-for-22 on 3-pointers to just 3-for-5 by the Pistons. It's the second straight game Milwaukee has shot at least 50 percent from the arc, as the Bucks hit on 9-for-14 in a victory over San Antonio Tuesday. TURNING POINT:  Detroit cut into an 18-point, third-quarter lead, and then trimmed a 94-82 deficit with 4:36 down to 94-91 with 1:23 left before Jennings drove the lane for a contested layup that stopped the Pistons momentum. The Pistons would never be closer than five the rest of the way. HOT:  Jennings made 9-for-15 shots, including 3-for-4 on 3-pointers. Jennings is 16-for-28 (57.1 percent) and 4-for-5 on 3-pointers in the last two games. NOT:  Pistons forward  Tayshaun Prince  went just 6-for-17 and had just one rebound. Prince is just 20-for-64 (31.3 percent) in his last six games. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Detroit center  Greg Monroe  went off for a career-high 32 points, and his 16 rebounds were just one short of tying his career best. INSIDE THE ARENA:  The first snowstorm of the season kept attendance down. While the crowd was announced as 11,465, there didn't appear to be more than 5,000 to 6,000 in the house. ... Buffalo Bills linebacker  Nick Barnett , a former Green Bay Packer, was in attendance. GOOD MOVE:  Skiles moved Leuer into the starting lineup at power forward in place of  Ersan Ilyasova  and got a 29-point night out of the position. Leuer posted 15 points, six rebounds and five assists in 31:32, and Ilyasova had 14 points and six rebounds in 19 minutes. ROOKIE WATCH:  Pistons point guard  Brandon Knight  went 7-for-9 and finished with 20 points and three assists. NOTABLE:  The two teams combined to go 41-for-41 on free throws, only the second time in the shot-clock era that neither team missed a free throw. The other time was on Dec. 22, 2000, when Atlanta and Toronto combined to go 16-for-16, with the Hawks making 11. ... Skiles recorded his 400th win as an NBA coach, becoming the 39th coach to reach that milestone. ... Milwaukee forward  Luc Richard Mbah a Moute  (right knee tendinitis) and point guard  Beno Udrih  (left shoulder sprain) and Detroit forward  Charlie Villanueva  (sore right ankle) missed the game. UP NEXT:  For the Pistons, Friday @ Charlotte, Sunday vs. Golden State, Tuesday at Houston. For the Bucks, Friday @ Dallas, Monday @ Philadelphia, Tuesday vs. Denver.
