  Notebook: Bucks 103, Pistons 82   By Rick Braun, for NBA.com Posted Monday January 30, 2012 11:47PM THE FACTS:   Brandon Jennings  scored 21 points, and  Mike Dunleavy Jr.  added 20 off the bench to lead the Milwaukee Bucks to an easy 103-82 victory over the Detroit Pistons Monday night at the Bradley Center. The Bucks (9-11) won for the fifth time in seven games after a 4-9 start to the season. The Pistons (4-18) lost for the fifth straight time and the ninth time in 10 games. Drew Gooden  added 16 points on 7-of-9 shooting in his third start for the Bucks since center  Andrew Bogut  went down with a fractured left ankle. Rodney Stuckey  had 19 points for the Pistons, who never led in the game and trailed the rest of the way after  Carlos Delfino's  3-pointer gave Milwaukee a 5-2 lead. QUOTABLE:  "I'm a Vegas guy, a blackjack guy. The numbers always come back. You can start off getting crushed by the house losing all your money, but if you stick around the tables long enough, you'll make it back."   -- Bucks swingman  Mike Dunleavy Jr.,  who was just 22-for-65 (33.8 percent) from the field before going 14-for-18 in his last two games. THE STAT:  The Bucks went 10-for-17 from beyond the arc while the Pistons were 1-for-9 -- a 30-3 edge. TURNING POINT:  The Bucks led by as many as 18 in the first half but settled for a 47-41 lead at the intermission and were letting the Pistons hang around for much of the third quarter. It was still 63-55 with 2:45 left in the third when Dunleavy hit a jumper that started a 22-7 run that stretched into the opening minutes of the fourth quarter and gave the Bucks an 85-62 lead. Dunleavy capped the run with consecutive 3-pointers. QUOTABLE II:  "Over the summer I put in a lot of hours -- especially the whole month of June working with  Scott Skiles  and working with the coaches. And, also, when I couldn't work with them I was in Baltimore working on my shot the whole summer. And I'm still working on it. My jumper's not great. It still needs improvement, so I just try to get shots up there every day."   -- Jennings, who shot 37.9 percent from the field over his first two seasons but is at 44.5 percent (153-for-344) this season. HOT:  Bucks center  Drew Gooden  canned 7 of 9 shots for 16 points and has made 22 of 38 in his three games as a starter since  Andrew Bogut  went out with a fractured left ankle. Gooden is averaging 20.7 points in the three games. NOT:  Pistons swingman  Damien Wilkins  went 0-for-5 and is now 7-for-25 over his last six games. GOOD MOVE:   Stephen Jackson  may not think it's a good move, but coach Skiles kept the swingman on the bench the entire game after Jackson was suspended by the league for Saturday's game. Jackson also was suspended by the team 10 days ago for missing a shootaround. The Bucks are 3-0 in the three games Jackson has not played. He's shooting just 36.7 percent (76-for-207) on the season. ROOKIE WATCH:  Pistons guard  Brandon Knight  had a rough one, going scoreless on 0-for-4 shooting with four turnovers in 24 minutes. NOTABLE:  The Bucks reached the century mark for the fourth straight game. They were the NBA's lowest scoring team a year ago averaging 91.2 points per game. ... The Pistons have lost by at least 17 in their last four road games. ... The Bucks went 36-for-70 (51.4 percent), topping the 50-percent mark for the second straight game.
