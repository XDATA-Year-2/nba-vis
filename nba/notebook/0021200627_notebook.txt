 THE FACTS: LaMarcus Aldridge  scored 27 points as Portland went nearly wire to wire with a 100-80 blowout of Indiana Wednesday night at the Rose Garden.  
 It was the most decisive victory of the season for the Trail Blazers (21-21), who snapped a season-high six-game losing streak. 
 
 Damian Lillard  collected 20 points and eight assists with no turnovers and  J.J. Hickson  picked up his 24th double-double of the campaign with 14 points and 13 rebounds for the Blazers. 
 
 Paul George  scored 22 points and  David West  tallied 15 of his 21 points in the second half for the Pacers (26-17), who had won 16 of their previous 21 games. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We've played so many two-point games, tonight was kind of weird for us. But the guys played great."  
 
 -- Aldridge 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Portland shot a season-high 56.4 percent from the field against the NBA's No. 1 defensive team. It was the best shooting percentage all season for an opponent of Indiana, which entered the game leading the league in scoring defense (89.1 points) and opponents' field-goal percentage (41.3). 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The game was tied 24-24 early in the second quarter when Aldridge and rookie  Will Barton  keyed a 20-4 run that pushed Portland ahead 44-28. The Pacers never got closer than six points the rest of the way. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Give Portland a ton of credit. (The Blazers) came out with great desperation. It's very difficult to play a really good team on a six-game losing streak. They brought the fight to us with their defense." 
 
 -- Indiana coach  Frank Vogel 
 
 
 HOT:  Aldridge was 8-for-11 in the first half and 12-for-17 in the game, scoring a majority of his points on mid-range jumpers. 
 
 NOT:  Indiana shot 37.5 percent from the field, the third-worst percentage by a Portland opponent this season. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Lillard scored 16 of his points in the second half, attacking the rim for many of his baskets. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Pacers matched Portland's offseason five-year, $55-million offer sheet for center  Roy Hibbert , who had nine points, seven rebounds and no blocked shots going against Portland's Hickson, who signed a one-year, $4-million deal. Hickson had 14 points and 13 boards. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Portland Trail Blazers had played a franchise-record 10 straight games that were decided by six points or fewer. The Blazers won the first four contests before dropping six in a row. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "Tonight was refreshing, especially since we were on the good side of it. That 10-game streak was fun basketball, but it was tough. We needed a win like that. We haven't had a lot of wins like that. To have it at this stage was pretty refreshing."  
 
 -- Portland coach  Terry Stotts 
 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Pacers, Saturday @ Utah, Monday @ Denver, Wednesday vs. Detroit. For the Trail Blazers, Saturday vs. L.A. Clippers, Sunday @ L.A. Clippers, Tuesday vs. Dallas.
