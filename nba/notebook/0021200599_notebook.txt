 THE FACTS:  Brandon Jennings  scored 30 points -- including four free throws in the final 33 seconds -- as Milwaukee held off a late Portland charge for a 110-104 victory Saturday night at the Rose Garden.  Ersan Ilyasova  collected 27 points and 14 rebounds for the Bucks (20-18), who are 5-2 under interim head coach  Jim Boylan . 
 
 Damian Lillard  scored 26 points and dished out 10 assists for the Trail Blazers (20-20), who have lost five in a row for the first time this season.  Wesley Matthews  added 21 points and  LaMarcus Aldridge  had 20 points and 14 rebounds for Portland. 
 Portland rallied from a 22-point third-quarter deficit to within four in the final minute before Jennings' gift shots put the game on ice. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We squandered the lead a little bit, but it's an NBA game and the other team is going to make plays. We could have closed out better, but when we needed to we made the plays, got the rebounds and the stops ... down the stretch."  
 
 -- Boylan 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Milwaukee scored 27 points off of 19 Portland turnovers. The Blazers had eight giveaways in the first nine minutes, in no small part to seven of the Bucks' dozen steals on the night. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  A 10-0 run got Portland to within 104-100, and the Blazers were inbounding the ball in frontcourt with 33.6 seconds left. Aldridge cut to the basket and thought he was fouled by  Ekpe Odoh  as he cut from the basket. There was no call as Aldridge cut to the basket and the inbound pass went out of bounds, along with the Blazers' final hopes. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "The game got away from us again in the first quarter. That was a bad stretch for us. But the second quarter wasn't much better."  
 
 -- Portland coach  Terry Stotts , whose team fell behind 30-12 in the first quarter and trailed 62-45 at the half 
 
 
 HOT:  Ilyasova sank 10 of 14 shots -- including 3 of 3 from 3-point range -- and scored a season-high 27 points despite playing only 26 minutes. 
 
 NOT:  Hampered by a sore wrist, Portland's  Nicolas Batum  was just  1-for-8 in the first half. He finished 2-for-9 and scored seven points, his low since scoring five on Dec. 8 against Sacramento. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  With 3:08 left in the third quarter and Milwaukee leading 80-65, Milwaukee center  Larry Sanders  got two technical fouls and was ejected by referee  Danny Crawford . Without Sanders, the Bucks' advantage inside was sorely compromised. 
 
 BAD MOVE II:  At that point, Boylan removed Ilyasova -- who had 27 points and 14 rebounds to that point -- from the game and didn't insert him again except for 14 seconds in the final minute of play. "For defensive purposes, mainly, especially with Sanders out," Boylan explained afterward, adding with a smile, "I was the only one who could stop (Ilyasova) tonight." 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "He showed tonight where he belongs -- that was an All-Star performance right there."  
 
 -- Boylan on Jennings  
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Portland has played nine straight games decided by six points or fewer, a franchise record. The Blazers won the first four and have lost the last five. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Bucks, Tuesday vs. Philadelphia, Friday @ Cleveland, Saturday vs. Golden State. For the Trail Blazers, Monday vs. Washington, Wednesday vs. Indiana, Saturday vs. L.A. Clippers.
