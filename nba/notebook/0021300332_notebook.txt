 THE FACT: Al Horford  beat the buzzer with a 12-foot catch-and-shoot jumper off an inbound pass to push the host Hawks to a 101-99 overtime win over the Wizards. It was only fitting that Horford, who tied a career high with 34 points, saved Atlanta after the Hawks lost a 15-point fourth-quarter lead. 
 
 THE LEAD:  The Hawks beat the Wizards 101-99 Friday night at Phillips Arena, but it wasn't that close the whole way. Atlanta was rolling when they took an 80-65 lead on two  Shelvin Mack  free throws with 8:06 left in regulation, but Wizards point guard  John Wall  awoke from a long slumber to score 11 of his 13 points as Washington (9-12) wrestled the lead from Atlanta (12-11) twice in the final period. 
 Much like Horford, who added 15 rebounds, Washington forward  Trevor Booker  had a monster game with 24 points and 14 rebounds and his reverse with 1.8 seconds left in overtime appeared good enough to force a second bonus period. 
 But Horford had other ideas. 
 Washington didn't miss the rebounding of injured big man  Nene , as the Wizards had a huge 60-46 rebounding edge. Even with an 18-11 edge in offensive rebounds, the Wizards only had a 54-48 advantage in points in the paint. 
 
 Paul Millsap  added a double-double for Atlanta with 16 points and 11 rebounds, and Washington center  Marcin Gortat  doubled up as well with 12 points and 10 rebounds. Wall added 11 assists.  
 
 QUOTABLE : "We work on that in practice. That's a play we've worked on, and we have three options. It was going to be me, Paul [Millsap] or  Kyle [Korver]  and they overplayed both of those guys.  Pero [Antic]  . . . gave me a great pass." 
 
 -- Al Horford 
 
 
 THE STAT:  16-6 -- The Wizards forced overtime by outscoring Atlanta 25-15 in the fourth quarter, in which they trailed by as many as 15 points, and Washington did it largely by outscoring Atlanta 16-6 in the paint.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  As the Wizards rallied from that late 15-point deficit over the final eight minutes of regulation, Wall scored nine points -- including a 26-foot 3-point shot -- grabbed a rebound and had an assist.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Wall got away from us a little bit in transition. He got aggressive in some pick-and-rolls. It seemed like John Wall really picked his game up." 
 
 -- Hawks coach   Mike Budenholzer 
 
 
 HOT:  Horford scored Atlanta's first five points, and had 17 points and eight rebounds in the first half. Booker shot 12-for-19. 
 
 NOT:  Washington shot just 5-for-17 in the third quarter. As Atlanta came unglued in the fourth quarter, the Hawks shot 4-for-20 in the period to blow a 15-point lead. Millsap missed all four of his shots, and Mack missed all three of his.  
 
 NOTABLE:  Nene was out for the Wizards, missing his second straight game with tendinitis in his right foot.  . . . Hawks reserve big man  Gustavo Ayon  missed his second straight game since suffering a sprained left ankle and left leg contusion. He is expected to travel with the team to New York for Sunday's game against the Knicks, but there is no guaranteed that he'll be available to play. . . . Korver hit four of his eight 3-pointers, stretching his NBA record streak of consecutive games with at least one trey made to 92. . . . Millsap's career-long streak of seven straight games making at least one trey ended. He missed two. . . . Hawks sub forward  Cartier Martin  continues to lose playing time. He entered Friday's game averaging 13 points per game despite going scoreless in 5:51 Tuesday against the Thunder. Friday, he was scoreless again while playing just 19 seconds. Some of his minutes were taken by  Elton Brand .  
 
 UP NEXT : For the Wizards, Saturday vs. L.A. Clippers, Monday @ New York, Wednesday @ Brooklyn. For the Hawks, Saturday @ New York, Monday vs. L.A. Lakers, Wednesday vs. Sacramento.
