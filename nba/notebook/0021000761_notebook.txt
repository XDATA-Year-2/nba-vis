  Cavaliers-Mavericks Notebook   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Tuesday February 8, 2011 12:08AM THE FACTS:  The Cavaliers stumbled into the history books with their NBA-record 25th straight loss on Monday, a 99-96 setback in Dallas against the league's hottest team.  Jason Terry  scored 11 of his 23 points in the fourth quarter to fuel the Mavericks, who survived a late push by Cleveland to extend their winning streak to nine. QUOTABLE:  "Everybody else put such a big emphasis on this just because of their record. They play hard. You just can't go out there expecting to blow a team out just because they've got 20-something losses in a row. They've just had some bad luck -- that's all it is. They compete and they've been in a lot of close games."  -  Mavericks forward   Shawn Marion. THE STAT:  Cleveland set the previous record for futility with a 24-game skid spanning the 1981-82 and 1982-83 seasons. The Cavaliers have not won since Dec. 18 and have dropped 35 of their last 36. They are 8-44 for the season, compared to 41-11 at this point last year. Led by Terry, Marion (17 points, 10 rebounds) and  Ian Mahinmi  (11 points, eight rebounds), the Mavericks' bench outscored the Cleveland reserves by a whopping 60-11 margin. TURNING POINT:  Cleveland trailed by 10 with less than three minutes remaining, but refused to quit. A 3-pointer by  Antawn Jamison  cut the deficit to 97-94, but Jamison missed a potential game-tying trey the next trip down the court. The Cavaliers had another chance to tie it up with 2.9 seconds remaining, but  Anthony Parker's  27-footer was off the mark. QUOTABLE II:  "When it hit the front of the rim, I still thought it was going to hit the backboard and trickle in. But it didn't happen. It is disappointing to come up short again. I thought we fought hard and played the right way. We just have to keep at it."  -  Parker   on his missed 3-pointer at the end of the game. HOT:  The Mavericks improved to 9-0 this season when Terry scores 10 or more points in the fourth quarter. Dallas is 10-1 when he scores at least 20 points. NOT:  Dallas missed its first eight shots of the game. Not to be outdone, Cleveland later misfired on nine consecutive first-half field-goal attempts as the Mavericks used a 17-2 run to turn a 26-19 deficit into a 36-28 advantage. Dallas shot 30.4 percent (7-for-23) in the third quarter, including 1-for-7 from behind the arc. Jamison was 8-for-23 from the field (1-for-6 3-pointers). FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:   Peja Stojakovic  started at small forward in his Mavericks debut and finished with eight points and five rebounds in 19:53. The 13-year veteran, signed by Dallas on Jan. 24, had not played since Nov. 26 (with the Raptors) due to an injured left knee. His 3-pointer with 11:15 remaining in the third quarter was the 1,719th of his career, tying him with  Dale Ellis  for fourth in NBA history. Teammate  Jason Kidd  ranks third on that list with 1,748. Cleveland got double-doubles from  J.J. Hickson  (26 points, 12 rebounds),  Ramon Sessions  (19 points, 13 assists) and Jamison (18 points, 11 boards).  Tyson Chandler  had 11 rebounds and 10 points for Dallas. INSIDE THE ARENA:   Dirk Nowitzki  received a standing ovation in the second quarter when the public-address announcer acknowledged the forward's 10th consecutive All-Star Game selection. He was bothered by a sore right wrist and finished with 12 points and five turnovers (including two in the final minute of the game). ROOKIE WATCH:   Christian Eyenga  tallied 13 of his 15 points during the first half, reaching double figures for the fourth consecutive game. He was one point shy of matching his season high. NOTABLE:  The Cavaliers play their next eight games and 10 of their next 11 at home. Cleveland has played more road games (30) than any other team in the league. The Cavaliers are 3-27 away from home, including 26 consecutive losses dating back to a Nov. 9 victory at New Jersey. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Wednesday @ Sacramento, Thursday @ Denver, Saturday @ Houston. For the Cavaliers, Wednesday vs. Detroit, Friday vs. Los Angeles Clippers, Sunday vs. Washington.
