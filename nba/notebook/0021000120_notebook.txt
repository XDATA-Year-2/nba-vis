
 Lakers-Nuggets notebook   By Michael Kelly, for NBA.com Posted Friday November 12, 2010 2:13AM THE FACTS:   Carmelo Anthony  had 32 points and 13 rebounds and the Denver Nuggets rallied in the fourth quarter to hand the Los Angeles Lakers their first loss of the season, 118-112. QUOTABLE:  "When we went small our speed beat their size."   -- Nuggets coach  George Karl THE STAT:  Backup point guard  Ty Lawson  scored 11 of his 17 points early in the fourth to spark a 16-0 Denver run and give his team a six-point lead. TURNING POINT:  Tied at 105,  J.R. Smith  hit a 3-pointer to spark an 11-0 Nuggets run to give them the lead for good. QUOTABLE II:  "It sucked."   -- Lakers coach  Phil Jackson  on his team's play in the fourth quarter HOT:  Lakers reserve guard  Shannon Brown  had 19 points and two highlight-reel dunks in a losing effort. NOT:   Lamar Odom  couldn't take advantage of Denver's lack of size, going 1-for-6 from the field and scoring just three points. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:   Pau Gasol  continues to put up strong numbers early in the season. He had 17 points and 20 rebounds, his fifth double-double in his last six games. GOOD MOVE:  Karl went small to start the fourth quarter and it was effective. Lawson's quickness got him into the lane and created opportunities for him and his teammates and the Lakers defensively had trouble catching up with the Nuggets' speed on the perimeter. ROOKIE WATCH:  Nuggets forward  Gary Forbes  provided a spark off the bench in just 16 minutes of play. NOTABLE:   Kobe Bryant  scored his 26,000th career point with a 13-foot jumper with 49 seconds into the second half. At 32 years, 80 days he is the youngest player to reach the mark, besting  Wilt Chamberlain  by 34 days. UP NEXT:  For the Lakers, Sunday vs. Phoenix, Tuesday @ Milwaukee, Wednesday @ Detroit. For the Nuggets, Monday @ Phoenix, Tuesday vs. New York, Thursday @ Portland.
