Kobe Bryant  was his usual self, coming alive in the fourth quarter and nailed a baseline jumper with 4.6 seconds left to seal the game. after the Lakers had squandered an 18 point lead at one point. The Lakers jumped out to a big lead early outscoring the Raptors 24-8 to start the first quarter and finish the frame 34-19, But the Raptors bench surged in the second, to close it to an 8 point lead going into halftime, 54-46. The Raptors outscored the Lakers 21-19 in the third quarter and took their first lead of the game with  Linas Kleiza's  floater in the lane with 2:45 of the fourth quarter, making it 86-84. The game went down to the wire with teams trading baskets and  Bryant's crunch time basket with 4.6 seconds left, put the Lakers on top 93-92. On the ensuing inbound play at half court the Raptors made a crucial 5 second violation, as  Rasual Butler  was unable to get the ball into play, turning over the ball on an opportunity to take the lead. Bryant was then fouled making 1 of 2 free throws and the Raptors were able to make the inbound play to  DeMar DeRozan  who's forced 3-point attempt came up empty as the buzzer sounded. The Lakers head home going 3-3 on their road trip and the Raptors are now 1-2 on a 7 game home stand. Bryant scored 27 points, including 11 in the fourth quarter and  Pau Gasol  played big for the Lakers with 16 points and 17 rebounds.  Andrew Bynum  chipped in 14 points with 9 rebounds.  Jose Calderon  had a game high and career high, 30 points with 6 assists for the Raptors, while  Linas Kleiza  and  Leandro Barbosa  scored off the bench with 15 and 12 points respectively. QUOTABLE:  "You got 2 minutes, you have Kobe Bryant on the floor, you have Pau and Drew on the floor. What is there to really worry about except play hard and win the game?"   -- Lakers forward  Metta World Peace  on the confidence in his team after squandering an 18 point lead. THE STAT:  The Raptors' bench outscored the Lakers' bench 43-24. However, however that may be more due to Toronto's starters inability, than the Lakers bench's ineptitude. The Toronto bench pulled them out of an 18-point deficit and gave them their first lead of the game in the fourth quarter. TURNING POINT:  Bryant's 17-foot fadeaway jump shot with 4.6 seconds from World Peace was the dagger. After the Raptors rallied back from an 18-point deficit, Bryant came alive in the fourth and his clutch jumper was the game winner. QUOTABLE II:  "He is a great player and has always been one of my favorite point guards. It wasn't surprising at all."   -- Bryant on the play of Raptors guard  Jose Calderon . HOT:  While the Raptors went 7 for 23 in the first quarter, alderon was the only player on point shooting 5-for-6. He finished the game with a career high 30 points on 13-of-18 shooting, including 4-for-4 from the 3-point line and six assists. NOT:  The Raptors started the game shooting 3 for 10 from the field with an array of air balls, bricks and missed gimmes putting them in a 21-6 whole with 5:55 left in the first quarter. They finished the quarter a dismal 7 for 23 on 30.4 percent shooting. GOOD MOVE:  Bryant woke up in the fourth quarter when the game was on the line, scoring 11 points, solid defense and a key steal down the stretch in the final stretch to close out the game for the win. Bryant scored 20 of his 27 points in the second half, BAD MOVE:  With 4.6 seconds left and the Raptors down 93-92, Butler checked into the game and was unable to inbound the ball, committing a 5 second violation. That turnover denied the Raptors a chance to get an attempt or take the lead in a highly contested fourth quarter. "I didn't go to college, but I can count. It was five seconds," said Bryant. NOTABLE:  The Lakers 34 points in the first quarter was an opponent season high for the Raptors, as well as a season high for the Lakers. ... Calderon's career high 30 points bettered his previous high of 27 against San Antonio 2/11/2008. ... Calderon's 13 field goals made was also a career high...the Lakers have now won four straight games against Toronto. ...Toronto shot a season high .545 (6 for 11) from three-point range. ...
