  Bobcats-Hawks notebook   By Matt Winkeljohn, for NBA.com Posted Saturday February 12, 2011 10:47PM THE FACTS:  Former Hawk  Stephen Jackson  hit a 19-foot jump shot at the final buzzer to give the Bobcats an 88-86 win in Atlanta Saturday night, the second straight home loss for the Hawks. Jackson scored 32 points as Atlanta frittered away a 22-point second-quarter lead and was outscored 49-34 in the second half.  Josh Smith  scored 28 points for Atlanta, which lost 117-83 Tuesday to the visiting Sixers. After missing two games with a back contusion,  Al Horford  had a double-double (16 points, 10 rebounds) for the Hawks.  Shaun Livingston  scored a season-high 22 points off the bench for Charlotte, which is 14-12 under coach  Paul Silas  after starting the season 9-19 under  Larry Brown .  Gerald Wallace  pitched in 16 points and 13 rebounds. The win snapped a seven-game losing streak in Atlanta for Charlotte, which last won on the Hawks' floor on Jan. 19, 2007. QUOTABLE:  "Even before we sat down to draw up a play, everybody was telling me to knock it down so I knew they were coming to me in that situation. We haven't won here in eight years (actually four) so it's good to get a win here especially after blowing one (Friday) night against New Jersey."  -  Stephen   Jackson, on his game-winner. THE STAT:  The Hawks were just 4 of 11 for 8 points in the paint in the second half. In the first half, Atlanta made 13 of 21 in the paint for 26 points. TURNING POINT:  Trailing 51-29 after Horford's layup with 2:51 left in the second quarter, the Bobcats began their rally right while outscoring Atlanta 10-1 to close the half. Then, 15 of 18 shots attempted by the Hawks in the third quarter were jumpers (Atlanta made 7) and the Hawks were 1 of 3 in the paint in the period. In that same quarter, the Bobcats made 7 of 9 shots in the paint while closing the deficit to 72-68. QUOTABLE II:  "Words can't describe it. We played so well in the first half. We controlled our own destiny in this game, and they just kept grinding. You have to take your hat off to them."  -  Atlanta's Josh Smith . HOT:  Gerald Wallace has scored in double figures (16 Saturday) with at least nine rebounds (13) in seven straight games. Over the past five games, Livingston has averaged 13.2 points on 24 of 43 shooting (55.8 percent). His two highest scoring outputs of the season (22 and 18 points) have come in that stretch. He's averaging 5.9 points for the season. NOT:  Atlanta's  Jamal Crawford  made just 1 of 9 shots (with two air balls), and missed all four of his 3-points attempts. In his past three games he's missed all nine of his 3-pointers, and made just 7 of 29 shots (24.1 percent) overall. With two points Saturday, the NBA's leading reserve scorer has averaged 5.7 points in that span.  Joe Johnson  has missed six straight 3-pointers over two games, including five Saturday. Atlanta's leading scorer had made 7 of 22 shots (31.8 percent) over those games. Josh Smith has 11 rebounds combined over the past two games. GOOD MOVE:  The game-winning play, a short inbounds pass from  Eduardo Najera  to Jackson on the left sideline, worked like a charm. Jackson paused for a few seconds, turned and fired over the outstretched hands of  Maurice Evans  and Horford. Silas called for his defense to switch more often in the second half, and he credited Livingston for helping the Bobcats be better at that. Atlanta made just 12 of 41 shots in the second half (29.3 percent) after making 21 of 41 (51.2 percent) in the first half. BAD MOVE:  Atlanta did a poor job attacking Charlotte's changed defensive philosophy. Swinging the ball around, but rarely attacking the goal (ending up with seven free-throw attempts in the second half while going 4 of 12 from behind the arc). No wonder Drew said, "We settled for a ton of jump shots. We fell in love with the 3-point line." NOTABLE:  The Hawks face a seven-game road trip while the Circus comes to town, wrapped around the All-Star break. Atlanta is 16-11 on the road. Joe Johnson had five assists to tie  Dominique Wilkins  (2,321) for sixth in Hawks history. UP NEXT:  For the Bobcats, Monday vs. Lakers, Tuesday @ Bulls, Feb. 22 vs. Raptors. For the Hawks, Monday @ Pistons, Wednesday @ Knicks, Feb. 22 @ Lakers.
