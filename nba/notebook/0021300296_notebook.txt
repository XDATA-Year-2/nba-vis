 THE FACT:  Paul George  goes off for 28 points on 9-for-14 shooting, including 4-for-4 from 3-point range, to lead the Pacers to a 111-100 win over the Spurs. 
 
 THE LEAD:  After losing the first quarter 28-20, the Pacers went off in the second and third to beat the Spurs. San Antonio made a bit closer with a late charge behind  Patty Mills . But Indiana was able to hold on for their 18th victory of the season. 
 George led the Pacers with 28 points, six assists and four rebounds.  David West  had 20 points on 9-for-12 shooting and eight rebounds, while five other Pacers were in double figures. 
 
 Kawhi Leonard  led San Antonio with 18 points and  Manu Ginobili  added 16.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "They're playing with great confidence and great belief in their basketball team that we can win anywhere, against anyone. It's a fun thing to be a part of." 
 -- Indiana coach  Frank Vogel 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Pacers outscored the Spurs 67-37 in the second and third quarters. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Spurs center  Tiago Splitter , battling tightness in his left calf, left the game with 8:33 left in the first half and never returned. With Splitter out, the Spurs struggled to defend down low and win the battle of the boards. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "In the second quarter, they started making some shots and we weren't able to keep up. We went cold, they got that lead, and we couldn't recover."  
 -- Spurs forward  Tim Duncan 
 
 
 HOT:  The Pacers went to the free throw line 28 times and converted 26 (92.9 percent). 
 
 NOT:  San Antonio shot just six free throws.

 Leonard tied a season high with 18 points on 8-for-13 shooting with three rebounds, three assists and two 3-pointers. Ginobili scored 16 points on 6-for-9 from the field with four 3-pointers and three assists off the bench. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Leonard tied a season high with 18 points. Seven players scored for the Pacers and all seven of them reached double figures. Despite being outrebounded 41-34, San Antonio had 23 second-chance points to Indiana's eight. The Spurs outscored the Pacers 25-12 over the last seven minutes of the fourth quarter but could not complete the comeback.
