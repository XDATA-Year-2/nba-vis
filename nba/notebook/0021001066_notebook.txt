  Timberwolves-Mavericks notebook   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Thursday March 24, 2011 11:31PM THE FACTS: Dirk Nowitzki  had 30 points and 11 rebounds Thursday as the Mavericks rallied for a 104-96 victory against the short-handed Timberwolves in Dallas. Making his first start of the season in place of injured leading scorer and league-leading rebounder  Kevin Love , Dallas native  Anthony Randolph  performed the double-double duties for Minnesota with a career-high 31 points and 11 boards. Jason Terry  (18),  Shawn Marion  (17) and  Peja Stojakovic  (16) also scored in double digits for Dallas, which has won 18 of its last 19 meetings with Minnesota and swept the season series for the fourth time in five seasons. The Timberwolves dropped their fifth straight and fell to 5-31 on the road. QUOTABLE:  "There's an outside chance. I don't know how great that chance is."  --  Timberwolves head coach  Kurt Rambis  on the possibility that Love could miss the rest of the season with his injury (left groin strain). THE STAT:  The victory gave the Mavericks (50-21) their 11th consecutive 50-win season. The only longer streaks in NBA history belong to the Spurs (1999-2000 to 2010-11) and Lakers (1979-80 to 1990-91), both with 12 straight. TURNING POINT:  In a tight game with 10 ties, nine lead changes and no lead greater than eight points for either side, a timely three-point play by  Tyson Chandler  and a 3-point dagger by Terry gave Dallas the victory. Trailing 94-93, Chandler corralled the rebound of Terry's missed trey and was fouled while flushing the putback. He sank the free throw and the Mavs never trailed again. A few possessions later, Terry added the exclamation point as Dallas outscored Minnesota 11-2 over the final 2:38. HOT:  Randolph, who attended Woodrow Wilson High in Dallas, scored 23 of his 31 in the first half and finished 14-for-20 from the field. His previous career high was 28 points vs. Orlando on Dec. 5, 2009. This was his first start since Jan. 8, 2010 when he was with Golden State. NOT:  In a frigid first quarter, the Mavericks shot 32 percent (8-for-25) from the field and missed their first nine attempts from beyond the arc before Stojakovic finally sank a 3-pointer with 35 seconds left in the quarter. Minnesota led 23-17 after one period. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  The Mavericks improved to 13-0 this season when Stojakovic plays at least 15 minutes. He was 4-for-8 from long distance in 26 minutes, 29 seconds, while the rest of the team was a combined 4-for-19. GOOD MOVE:  Marion was in the starting lineup after missing Sunday's win against Golden State with a sprained right wrist. Head coach  Rick Carlisle  said he wanted "The Matrix" in there to defend  Michael Beasley , who was held to 12 points on 4-for-11 shooting with five turnovers. ROOKIE WATCH:  Minnesota guard  Wes Johnson  made three 3-pointers and contributed 11 points and four rebounds. NOTABLE:  The Mavericks, owners of the NBA's best road record at 24-10 (.706), embark on a six-game, 10-day road trip and won't play again in Dallas until April 6 vs. Denver... A day after celebrating his 38th birthday, Dallas point guard  Jason Kidd  had 13 assists, six rebounds, three steals and zero points on 0-for-5 shooting... Nowitzki was 5-for-5 at the line to extend his streak to 63 consecutive free throws made, the longest in the NBA this season...Randolph was the only member of Minnesota's starting lineup to see any action in the fourth quarter as Rambis let reserves  Jonny Flynn, Wayne Ellington, Anthony Tolliver  and  Martell Webster  each play all 12 minutes. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Saturday @ Utah, Sunday @ Phoenix, Wednesday @ Los Angeles Clippers. For the Timberwolves, Friday @ Oklahoma City, Sunday vs. Boston, Wednesday vs. Chicago.
