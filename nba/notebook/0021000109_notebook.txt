
 Jazz-Magic notebook   By Dick Scanlon, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday November 10, 2010 10:58PM THE FACTS:  The Utah Jazz completed a two-game sweep of Florida on Wednesday night, coming back from an 18-point deficit in the second half to beat the Orlando Magic 104-94.  Deron Williams  scored 17 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter while dishing out five of his 14 assists. The Jazz, who had won in overtime in Miami on Tuesday night, handed the Magic their first loss in the new Amway Center. QUOTABLE:  "We just got a couple of easy baskets. The score starts going down, we started gaining confidence and they start -- I wouldn't say panicking, but kind of pressing -- and we took advantage of that."  -- Deron Williams on the Jazz's furious second-half comeback THE STAT:  The Jazz scored 69 points in the second half against the team that had given up the fewest points in the NBA (88.7 per game). TURNING POINT:  After a 3-pointer by  Rashard Lewis  had given Orlando a 74-56 lead late in the third quarter, Utah took control with a 24-2 run. HOT:  After scoring 42 points in the fourth quarter at Miami on Tuesday night, the Jazz shot 14-for-21 and scored 39 more in the fourth quarter Wednesday. NOT:   Ryan Anderson  started at power forward for the Magic, was yanked after committing two turnovers in the first 94 seconds, and never got back in the game. QUOTABLE II:  "When I'm looking at 21 turnovers and three straight games of giving teams 50 percent [shooting], then I know we have problems."  -- Magic coach  Stan Van Gundy FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Utah's  Paul Millsap  has put up superstar numbers in the last three games, averaging 31.3 points and nine rebounds on 61 percent shooting. NOTABLE:  The Jazz have been behind by 16, 19 and 10 points at halftime in the last four days, and won all three games. UP NEXT:  For the Jazz, Friday at Atlanta, Saturday @ Charlotte, Monday vs. Oklahoma City. For the Magic, Friday vs. Toronto, Saturday @ New Jersey, Monday vs. Memphis.
