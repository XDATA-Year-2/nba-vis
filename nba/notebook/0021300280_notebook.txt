 THE FACT:  The Bobcats held the Sixers to just 88 points and have kept their opponents under 100 points in 13 consecutive games, the longest current streak in the NBA and the second-longest streak in franchise history.  
 
 THE LEAD: Kemba Walker  (18 points, 10 dishes) and  Al Jefferson  (14 and 12) each had a double-double as the Charlotte Bobcats picked up a 105-88 win over the Philadelphia 76ers Friday night at Time Warner Cable Arena. The 105 points was a season-high for Charlotte.  
 
 Jeffery Taylor  tied his career-high with a team-best 20 for the Bobcats (9-11), while Tony Wroten had a game-best 21 points for the 76ers (7-13) in the loss.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We've got a lot of good pieces this year. We pay really well as a unit. We all want to play hard for each other and we have one common goal that unites us. I just had to get out there tonight and contribute. We wanted to take care of the home court and did that tonight." 
 
 --Charlotte forward Jeffery Taylor 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Bobcats had its best offensive night of the season. Charlotte set a season-best mark for both points (105) and points in the paint (58) while shooting 46.2 percent (42-for-91). They also had six players in double figures. Charlotte came into the game with the lowest scoring average (88.8) and lowest field goal percentage (.409) in the league.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Bobcats used an 8-0 run to start the second quarter and never looked back against Philadelphia.  Josh McRoberts  scored all four of his points in the middle of the Charlotte run which spanned 2:50 and took the lead from 36-33 to 44-33. The Bobcats held that same 11-point lead at the break. 
 
 HOT:  Jefferson has played a strong stretch of games for the Bobcats. The Charlotte center, who was the team's biggest free-agent acquisition over the summer, has four consecutive double-doubles after his 14-point, 12-rebound night. Jefferson is averaging 18.0 points and 12.3 rebounds over the last four games and has added seven assists, five steals and five blocks in the stretch as well. Jefferson is the first Bobcats since  Gerald Wallace  in 2011 to have a double-double in at least three consecutive games. He has scored in double figures in seven straight games.  
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT : Walker had his first double-double of the season with his 18-point, 10-assist night. Walker also threw in three steals and failed to commit a turnover as well in 38 minutes of action Friday. Over the last three games Walker is averaging 20.3 points, 7.0 assists and just 2.0 turnovers.  
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The Bobcats played tribute to Nelson Mandela prior to the game with a moment of silence and a presentation on the scoreboard. Time Warner Cable Arena was also filled with fans of Duke and Florida State who were in town in advance of the Dr. Pepper/ACC Championship Game, which is being played at Bank of American Stadium in Charlotte Saturday night.  
 
 ROOKIE WATCH: Cody Zeller  scored a career-best 10 points and grabbed five rebounds in 12 minutes of action against the Sixers. Sixers' rookie  Hollis Thompson  had 12 points while rookie sensation  Michael Carter-Williams  was sidelined with a knee injury.  
 
 NOTABLE:  Bobcats center  Bismack Biyombo  left the game in the second quarter with a sprained right ankle and did not return. He is day-to-day ...  Gerald Henderson  has now scored in double figures in 11 straight games and is averaging 15.7 points and 5.2 rebounds over his last 17 games ... Charlotte is now 2-0 when scoring 100 or more points ... the Sixers have lost eight straight on the road and are now 0-2 when scoring below 90 points ... Philadelphia has trailed by double-digits in 16 of their 20 games this season ...  Wroten, in five games as a starter, is averaging 19.8 points, 6.2 assists and 4.8 rebounds in 37.0 minutes per game ... the Sixers also experienced plane trouble and were delayed in leaving Charlotte Friday night.  
 
 UP NEXT : For the Sixers, Saturday vs. Denver, Monday vs. Clippers, Wednesday @ Minnesota. For the Bobcats, Monday vs. Golden State, Wednesday vs. Orlando, Friday @ Indiana.
