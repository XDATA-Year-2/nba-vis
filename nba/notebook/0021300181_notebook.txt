 THE FACT:  Since Memphis upset San Antonio in the first round of the playoffs in 2011, the Spurs have now beaten the Grizzlies 12 of the last 14 times they've played, including six in a row.  
 
 THE LEAD:  San Antonio guard  Tony Parker  saved his best for last, scoring 11 of his team-high 20 points in the fourth quarter as the Spurs withstood a furious rally by Memphis to win, 102-86, at FedExForum. Parker had just two points combined in the second and third quarters.  Tiago Splitter  added 17 points and seven rebounds and  Manu Ginobili  scored 15 with seven assists off the bench. The Grizzlies were led by  Mike Conley's  game-high 28 while  Zach Randolph  had 16 points and 10 boards. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Obviously, they have our number. Six straight games they've beat us. We have to catch up to where they're at. They're a good team. One thing they do well is they stick to their system, offensively and defensively. They just take what's open. ... Those guys stick to what they do for 48 minutes. When you have a team that's consistently doing that, it's no coincidence they're 11-1 now. We're a work in progress."  --  Grizzlies guard  Tony Allen . 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Spurs are 11-1 which ties the team record for their best start through 12 games. They were 11-1 in 2010-11 and didn't lose again until their 15th game. 
 
 TURNING POINT : After trailing by as many at 14, the Grizzlies were trimmed the deficit to 79-78 with 6:38 to go before Parker ignited an 8-0 run with six points of his own to regain control for the Spurs. 
 
 HOT:  Conley did his part to try and will the Grizzlies to victory. With  Marc Gasol  knocked out of the game with a knee injury and Randolph struggling against the taller Spurs, Conley scored 28 points on 12 of 19 shooting and was 2 of 3 from 3-point range. He was one point shy of his season high and three away from his career high. It was his sixth game with 20 or more points this season. 
 
 NOT:  San Antonio forward  Tim Duncan  has had a miserable start to the season. He entered tonight's game shooting just 37.5 percent (42 of 112) from the floor. Duncan was 3 of 8 for just eight points, but he didn't manage to hit a key jumper with 4:37 remaining in the game that capped an 8-0 Spurs run. They went on to close out the game with a 23-8 run which includes making seven of their last eight field goals. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It felt good to see one go in. It doesn't feel good that that is what everybody gets excited about now, me actually making a shot. But it'll come around. I'll continue to work and hopefully get something going again."  --  Duncan . 
 
 NOTABLE:  Gasol went down with 10:24 left in the second quarter after a basket by San Antonio's  Jeff Ayres . He left the game with a left sprained knee and will undergo an MRI on Saturday. He had two points, two rebounds and three assists at the time and the Grizzlies were down, 30-23. The Spurs closed out the half with a 21-10 run to lead, 51-37. ... The Spurs shot 61 percent in the fourth quarter, making 11 of 18 field goals, while holding the Grizzlies to 7 of 21 shooting (33.3 percent). ... The Grizzlies had their season-high four-game winning streak snapped. ... Despite getting his sixth consecutive double-double, Randolph continues to struggle against the Spurs. Splitter fronted Randolph all night, making it difficult for him to get the ball. And when it did, Randolph struggled to get his shot over Splitter. He was 5 of 15 from the floor. In the season opener at San Antonio, Randolph was 1-for-6 and had just two points. ... After playing sparingly in recent games, Memphis forward  Ed Davis  was pressed into duty after Gasol's injury. Davis responded with six points, one shy of his season-high, and four rebounds in 15 minutes. Center  Kosta Koufas  played a season-high 28 minutes and had six points and seven boards.
