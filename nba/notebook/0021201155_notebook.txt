 THE FACTS:  Behind excellent production from  Brook Lopez  (29 points, 11 rebounds) and  Reggie Evans  (17 points, 24 rebounds), the Nets blew out the 76ers 104-83 at Barclays Center. The Nets dominated the Sixers in the paint and improved to 29-4 against teams with sub.-.500 winning percentage at the time of the game. The Sixers shot 37.5 percent from the field and were led by  Nick Young , who scored all 18 of his points in the second half, which the Sixers entered down 18.   
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It's hard to be critical of anything." 
 -- Nets interim Coach  P.J. Carlesimo 
 
 
 THE STAT:   The Nets pounded the Sixers on the offensive glass, finishing with a 24-8 advantage. As a result, the Nets had 25 second chance points to just 6 for the Sixers.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  After missing a layup, Lopez missed a tip-in, grabbed the rebound and was fouled. He split a pair of free throws to give the Nets a 23-17 lead and then scored four of the next six points on as the Nets took full control of the game with a 7-0 run.  
 
 QUOTEABLE II:  "Brook draws a lot of attention when he has the ball and that gives Reggie the green light to do what he does best. Reggie can rebound and put the ball back up for easy points. They both beat us really bad tonight." 
 -- Sixers center  Spencer Hawes  
 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  For the one hundredth anniversary of the first game played at Ebbets Field, the Nets' honored the Brooklyn Dodgers' 1955 championship team by displaying the official pennant, on loan from the Brooklyn Museum.  
 
 ROOKIE WATCH: Arnett Moultrie  and  Justin Holiday  both scored four points and grabbed four rebounds for the Sixers. ...  Kris Joseph  made his Barclays Center debut for the Nets midway through the fourth quarter with the game in hand. He played over five minutes alongside fellow rookies  Tyshawn Taylor  and  Mirza Teletovic .  
 
 NOTABLE:  With his 158th 3-pointer,  Deron Williams  tied  Kerry Kittles  for the Nets' single-season franchise record. ... Evans had a double-double (10 points, 10 rebounds) in the first quarter and the crowd chanted "Reg-gie!" in his honor.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the 76ers, Wednesday vs.  Atlanta, Friday @ Washington, Sunday vs. Cleveland. For the Nets, Wednesday @ Boston, Friday @ Indiana, Sunday @ Toronto.
