 THE FACTS:  Kobe Bryant  scored six of his game-high 34 points in overtime, and the Los Angeles Lakers beat the Golden State Warriors 118-115 Saturday night at Oracle Arena as point guard  Steve Nash  returned to the lineup after missing 24 games. 
 Nash played for the first time since Oct. 31 against Portland when he fractured a bone in his lower left leg in the second game of the season. Nash started and played nearly 41 minutes. He had nine assists and 12 points, including a fade-away jump shot from 14 feet, giving the Lakers a 118-115 lead with 16.9 seconds left in overtime. 
 After Warriors guard  Stephen Curry  missed a 3-point shot, rookie center  Festus Ezeli  grabbed the rebound for Golden State, but he turned the ball over on an errant pass.   
 The two teams ended regulation tied 108-108, but the Lakers outscored Golden State 10-7 in overtime. 
 
 Metta World Peace  came off the bench to score 20 points and grab five rebounds for the Lakers.  Jordan Hill , another reserve, scored 14 points and had eight rebounds.  Dwight Howard  scored 11 points before fouling out in overtime. 
 Guard  Jarrett Jack  came off the bench to score a season-high 29 points for Golden State and had 11 assists for his second double-double of the season. Curry scored 20 points, and  David Lee  had a double-double with 20 points and 11 rebounds.  Klay Thompson  added 18 points for the Warriors. 
 The Lakers (13-14) beat the Warriors (18-10) for the sixth straight time overall and second straight time this season. They've  won 18 of  the past 19 games against Golden State. 
 The Warriors led 31-27 after the first quarter, 61-53 at halftime and 87-74 after three quarters. But the Lakers outscored Golden State 34-21 in the fourth quarter to force overtime. 
 The Lakers scored the first four points in overtime on a Howard put-back and Bryant jumper, taking a 112-108 lead. The Warriors cut the lead to 116-115 on a Curry 3 with 33.8 seconds, but Nash answered with his jumper. 
 Bryant shot just 16 of 41 from the field overall, but he was 3-for-6 in the fourth quarter and 3-for-6 in overtime. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "There's some soreness and some pain, but right now it's OK. It's manageable. As long as it's manageable I'll just keep going."  
 -- Nash, after playing his first game since breaking a bone in his left leg Oct. 31. 
 
 THE STAT:  Lee scored just two points in the fourth quarter and was shut out in overtime. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Lakers opened the fourth quarter on a 21-8 run and tied the game 95-95 on Bryant's 3-pointer, with the assist going to Nash. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "They started making shots and we didn't take care of the basketball. You look back and realize that one defensive rebound, one well executed defensive trip, one less turnover and we are out of here before overtime. It's disappointing the way the fourth quarter went, but Kobe Bryant has a history of making shots. He did that tonight."  
 -- Warriors coach  Mark Jackson 
 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Warriors starting forward  Harrison Barnes  scored 13 points, grabbed four rebounds and had three steals. Seven of his points came in the final six minutes of regulation. He spent much of the night guarding Bryant, contributing to the Laker superstar's off shooting night. 
 
 HOT:  Jack was blistering hot for the Warriors in the second quarter. After drilling a 3-pointer late in the first -- his only shot of the quarter -- he went 7-for-10 from the field and 1-for-2 from long range in the second for 15 more points. He went 13-for-19 for the game. 
 
 NOT:  Lakers forward  Antawn Jamison  is averaging 20 minutes per game, but for the second straight game he didn't get off the bench. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Bryant, who entered the game as the NBA's leading scorer at 29.5 points per game, got off to a slow start, shooting 5 of 17 for 11 points in the first half and went just 16-for-41 for the night. But he hit some clutch shots in the fourth quarter and overtime and scored over 30 points for the eighth straight game. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  Lakers radio color commentator  Mychal Thompson  had a courtside seat to watch the game and his son, Warriors guard Klay Thompson. Mychal was drafted No. 1 overall in the 1978 NBA draft by Portland. He played for the Trail Blazers and Lakers during his 12-year NBA career. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Lee scored over 20 points for the 12th straight time, setting another career high. He had at least 20 points and 10 rebounds for a league-leading 12th time. ... Bryant had 10 rebounds to go with his 34 points for a double-double. ... Bryant attempted 41 shots and became the first NBA player to attempt 40 or more in a game since he accomplished that feat on Jan. 14, 2008 against Seattle. Saturday's game marked the ninth time in his career he's attempted at least 40 shots. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Lakers, Tuesday vs. New York, Wednesday @ Denver, Friday vs. Portland. For the Warriors, Wednesday @ Utah, Friday vs. Philadelphia, Saturday vs. Boston.
