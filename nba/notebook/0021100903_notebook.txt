  Notebook: Hornets 75, Bobcats 67 Posted Monday April 16, 2012 10:36PM By Derek S. Smith, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  The Charlotte Bobcats set a franchise record with its 17th-straight loss Monday night at Time Warner Cable Arena while the visiting New Orleans Hornets picked up their fourth consecutive win. The Bobcats lost 75-67 to the New Orleans Hornets.  Greivis Vasquez  led New Orleans with 20 points while  Gerald Henderson  netted a game-high 27 for Charlotte. QUOTABLE:  "It was tough at time to watch, especially seeing the ball go in and out and turning the ball over. Those kinds of things happen. They competed out there, even though it didn't look pretty. We still held an NBA team to 67 points. That is something you can hang your hat on."   -- New Orleans coach  Monty Williams THE STAT:  Clang. The two teams showed why they are at the bottom of their respective conferences with tonight's offensive performance. The teams combined to shoot 32 percent (49-of-153) from the floor and 7.4 percent (2-of-27) from behind the arc. The Bobcats, which shot a season low 30.3 percent, came into the game at the bottom of the league in scoring (87.9 ppg), scoring differential (13.3 ppg) and field goal percentage (41.8 percent) TURNING POINT:  Missed free throw. Henderson missed the backend of a two-shot opportunity at the free throw line with 28 seconds left to play. The Bobcats were down just four points at the time and the make would have allowed Charlotte the opportunity to play defense rather than foul. The Hornets went 7-of-9 in the final minute of the game. HOT:  Vasquez scored 14 of the Hornets 40 second half points on 5-of-10 shooting. Vasquez scored a career-high tying 20 points to lead all New Orleans players. Vasquez has scored in double figures in five of the last six games and added six assists in the win over Charlotte. NOT:  The Third Quarter. The Bobcats and Hornets shot a combined 6-of-40 in the third quarter. The two teams combined to score 20 points in the quarter. That's the fewest combined points in a quarter since 2004 when the New Jersey Nets and Portland Trail Blazers combined for 19. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Henderson scored 27 points Monday night and has tallied 20-plus points in three of the last five games. He's averaging 18.4 points and shooting 52.1 percent (38-of-73) in that span and has led the team in scoring on three of those occasions. ROOKIE WATCH:   Kemba Walker  started at point guard for Charlotte and tallied 14 points and had five rebounds and three assists. Fellow rookie  Bismack Biyombo  had five points and nine rebounds. New Orleans rookie  Jerome Dyson  had nine points off the bench and added three rebounds, one steal and one block to his stat line. NOTABLE:  The Bobcats have lost 17 straight, 19 of their last 20, 22 of their last 24, 27 of their last 30 and 43 of their last 47. ... New Orleans is 15-10 when holding an opponent to 90 points or less and 5-1 when holding them under 80 points. ... The Hornets held the Bobcats to 30.3% shooting which was an opponent season-worst.  ...  Carl Landry  had his fifth double-double of the season with his 14-point, 12-rebound night. ...
