 THE FACT:  KD scores his fourth career triple-double to lead the Thunder past Minnesota. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Kevin Durant had a monster game with 32 points, 12 assists, 10 rebounds, four steals and four blocked shots to lead the Thunder to their ninth straight win at home (and seventh overall), 113-103 over the Minnesota Timberwolves. 
 Durant was 14-for-21 from the field but only got to the free throw line twice, making just one.  Russell Westbrook  added 19 points on 7-for-15 shooting, and his backup,  Reggie Jackson , sparked a Thunder run with 18 points on 8-for-11 shooting.  Serge Ibaka  just missed his fourth straight double-double with 15 points and eight rebounds. 
 Four Minnesota starters were in double figures as  Kevin Martin , the former OKC sixth man, led the Wolves with 24 points and center  Nikola Pekovic  added a double-double with 22 points and 10 rebounds.  Kevin Love  finished with 16 points but was just 4-for-16 from the field, missing 10 of his last 11 shots. 
 Minnesota started the game shooting 60 percent but finished at just 41.6 percent. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Our defense in the second half was outstanding. We didn't give up anything easy and we took care of the basketball. In the first half we were throwing it around all over the floor. We had a lot of guys play great team basketball tonight." 
 
 -- Thunder coach  Scott Brooks 
 
 
 THE STAT:  In the second half the Thunder held Minnesota to just 34.1 percent shooting and just 26.1 percent overall and 14.3 percent (1-for-7) on 3-pointers in the critical fourth quarter. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Thunder trailed for the first three quarters and were down by as many as 11 points, until an 8-0 run gave OKC its first lead early in the fourth quarter. The run extended out to 16-5 to give the Thunder a cushion they would not give up. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We played great through three quarters but we had some slippage in the fourth. They turned up the pressure. We played tired and lost our confidence with what we're supposed to do. We'll learn from that and move on." 
 
 -- Martin 
 
 
 HOT:  Minnesota started the game shooting 60 percent (12-for-20) overall in the first quarter and 50 percent (4-for-8) on 3s. ... Durant was 5-for-7 (11 points) in the first 12 minutes and finished the half with 20 points on 9-for-11 shooting. ... OKC was shooting 58.1 percent (25-for-43) at halftime. ... Martin was 5-for-9 (17 points) at halftime. ... The Thunder shot 60.9 percent in the fourth quarter. ... Jackson was 5-for-5 (11 points) in the final 12 minutes. 
 
 NOT:  Ibaka was 2-for-7 (four points) in the first quarter. ... After having just two turnovers in the first quarter, the Thunder gave it back eight times in the second. ... Martin was 0-for-4 in the fourth quarter. ... Love was 0-for-3. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The 122nd consecutive sellout inside Chesapeake Energy Arena. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Halfway through the second quarter, Durant blocked a Pekovic shot at the rim, grabbed the ball and raced back the other way, dodging past Martin and getting the layup. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  On two consecutive possessions in the second quarter OKC turned the ball over on passes.  Kendrick Perkins  tried to hit  Thabo Sefolosha  with a pass down low but Sefolosha couldn't handle it, leading to a Wolves score at the other end. On OKC's next possession Durant hit Ibaka with a perfect pass, but he bobbled it leading to another Minnesota basket. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Thunder backup center  Steven Adams  played just nine minutes, scoring two points and grabbing four rebounds. 
 
 NOTABLE:  According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Durant is the first player with 30+ points, 10 rebounds, 12 assists, four steals and four blocks in the same game since blocks and steals became official stats in the 1973-74 season. ... The only other player to have 30, 10, 10, four and four is  Michael Jordan , who did it in Jan. 16, 1988. ... The Thunder have swept a six-game homestand for just the second time in franchise history (swept a seven-game homestand in the 1977-78 season). 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Timberwolves: Wednesday vs. San Antonio (at Mexico City), Saturday vs. Miami, Tuesday (Dec. 10) @ Detroit. For the Thunder: Tuesday @ Sacramento, Wednesday @ Portland, Friday @ New Orleans.
