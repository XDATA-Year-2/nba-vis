  Kings-Trail Blazers notebook   By Kerry Eggers, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday December 28, 2011 2:09AM THE FACTS:  Portland closed the first half with a 14-2 rush to go into intermission in a 46-46 tie and dominated from there in a 101-79 rout of Sacramento on Tuesday night at the Rose Garden. Forwards  Gerald Wallace  and  LaMarcus Aldridge  combined for 49 points and 16 rebounds for the Blazers (2-0).  DeMarcus Cousins  led the Kings (1-1) with 16 points and 11 boards. QUOTABLE:  "You try to play through it, but I was tired. I was really tired. I had to push the energy button and try to get my teammates going."   -- Gerald Wallace, who scored 10 of his 25 points in the first quarter when the Blazers weren't getting much done at either end. THE STAT:  In the game's first 20 minutes, Sacramento had six turnovers and was 21-for-38 (.553) from the field. Over the game's final 28 minutes, the Kings turned the ball over 14 times and were 10-for-44 (.227) from the field. TURNING POINT:  Sacramento led 44-32 with four minutes left in the first half when Portland went on its 14-2 tear to get even at the half. All the momentum went in the home team's direction in the second half. QUOTABLE II:  "He can play by himself. I need a day off. I'm not ready to play tomorrow."    -- LaMarcus Aldridge, after teammate  Marcus Camby  jokingly told reporters he wished the Blazers had a third straight game on Wednesday. HOT:  Portland led 70-65 late in the third quarter, then hit five of its next six shots en route to a 10-0 tear that all but put the game out of reach for the Kings. NOT:  After two games, Blazer guards  Jamal Crawford  (.333),  Raymond Felton  (.273) and  Wesley Matthews  (.286) are all struggling with their shot. QUOTABLE III:  "We had our moments, and then we fell apart."    -- Coach  Paul Westphal  on the Kings' second-half collapse. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Actor  Daniel Dae Kim  of the TV show "Hawaii 5-0" and Chicago Cubs second baseman  Darwin Barney  were in the house. GOOD MOVE:  Portland used its size to full advantage in the second half, posting up over smaller defenders time and time again. The Blazers outscored the Kings 52-42 in points in the paint -- 28-12 in the second half. BAD MOVE:  Westphal used 5-foot-9  Isaiah Thomas  and 6-foot-2  Jimmer Fredette  in the backcourt together for several minutes in the third quarter. Portland posted up Fredette with 6-foot-8  Nicolas Batum  three times before Westphal was forced to remove the rookie. NOTABLE:  The Blazers have won 10 of their last 11 meetings with the Kings. UP NEXT:  For the Blazers, Thursday vs. Denver, Sunday @ L.A. Clippers, Tuesday @ Oklahoma City. For the Kings, Thursday vs. Chicago, Saturday vs. New York, Sunday vs. New Orleans.
