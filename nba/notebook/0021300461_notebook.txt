 THE FACT:  Indiana posted a 56-24 record in the 2013 calendar year, finishing last season 31-19 and starting this one 25-5. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Unable to find the range from the perimeter most of the night, the Pacers turned to their most trusted ally -- defense -- to pull away in the fourth quarter for a 91-76 victory over Cleveland before a sellout crowd of 18,165 on New Year's Eve at Bankers Life Fieldhouse.  Paul George  shot poorly but scored a game-high 21 for Indiana, which won its fifth in a row overall and eighth straight against the Cavs.  Roy Hibbert  scored 19.  Anderson Varejao  scored 14 with 11 rebounds to lead Cleveland (10-21), which lost its sixth in a row. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Tonight's game was a perfect example of how to go out and win a game when your shot's not really falling. Aside from  George Hill , nobody could hit a perimeter shot so you have to get it done in other ways and we did it by buckling down on defense." 
 -- Indiana coach  Frank Vogel 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Pacers limited the Cavs to 10 points on 3-for-16 shooting, including 0-for-5 from the 3-point line, and forced seven turnovers in dominating the fourth quarter 26-10. 
 
 TURNING POINT:   A lackluster first half was nothing new for the Pacers, but watching the Cavs stand toe-to-toe with them in the third quarter was a major departure. Cleveland took a 66-65 lead into the fourth quarter, just the sixth time this season the Pacers trailed after three. After  Tyler Zeller's  jumper the visitors led 68-65 with 11:46 remaining but that's where Indiana took over. With  Luis Scola  active around the basket at both ends, Hill chipping in some timely buckets and George finally getting untracked for 10 points, the Pacers put together a 26-6 run to put the game away. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:   "We've been talking about that, and not taking games for granted.  That's a good basketball team over there (the Cavs) and they have a lot of firepower.  Our thing was to come in and finish 2013 with a bang." 
 -- Hill 
 
 
 HOT:  Hibbert shot 8-for-13. ... Hill was 3-for-6 from the 3-point line. 
 
 NOT:  The Cavs' starting lineup combined to shot 15-for-49 (.306). ... George was 7-for-19, including 2-for-11 from the 3-point line. ... In fact, aside from Hill, the Pacers shot 2-for-19 from long range. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "I thought the worst happened.  I continued to play but I felt something pop in my knee and I was falling down around all over the place. I'm going to have an MRI tomorrow and we'll see how it goes.  But it was a painful experience.  When I went back out it still didn't feel right." 
 --    Kyrie Irving   on his apparent knee injury in the third quarter 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Cavs got a scare late in the third quarter when Irving fell to the floor holding his left knee after a drive, and needed assistance from teammates to make it to the locker room. But he returned to the bench a short time later and checked back into the game with 9:28 remaining. ... Irving wound up playing 35:09 and producing 10 points and five assists. ...  Dion Waiters  scored 12 off the bench for the Cavs. ... Hill scored 13 and  Danny Granger  12 for the Pacers. ... This marked the first time in 10 games Cleveland held an opponent to less than 100 points. ... The Pacers recorded their 10th sellout, matching the total for all of last season. ... The Cavs were 1-for-12 from the 3-point line. ... Hibbert had five blocked shots, and the Pacers are 8-0 when he has at least that many. ...Varejao played his 500th game with the Cavs, which ranks 10th on the franchise's all-time list. If he is able to play the rest of the season, he would move past  LeBron James  (548),  Brad Daugherty  (548) and  Craig Ehlo  (513) into sixth place. 
 
 UP NEXT:   For the Pacers, Wednesday at Toronto, Saturday vs. New Orleans, Sunday at Cleveland. For the Cavs, Thursday vs. Orlando, Saturday at Brooklyn, Sunday vs. Indiana.
