 THE FACT: Kemba Walker  scores Charlotte's last 15 points to overcome  Stephen Curry's  season-high 43 points and lift his team to a win over the Golden State Warriors on Monday night. 
 
 THE LEAD:  The Bobcats held off a Golden State rally and beat the Warriors 115-111 on Monday night at Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte, N.C. 
 Walker finished with 31 points -- tying his season high -- to lead six players in double figures for Charlotte (10-11) and overcome a season-best 43-point night by Warriors guard (and Charlotte native) Curry. 
 
 Gerald Henderson  added 24 points,  Ramon Sessions  had 13,  Ben Gordon  12,  Al Jefferson  11 and  Josh McRoberts  finished with 11 points and 10 rebounds for the Bobcats, who led by as many as 15 points in the third quarter. 
 
 Klay Thompson  had 22 points and  Harrison Barnes  and  David Lee  added 14 apiece for Golden State (12-10). 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It it fun (facing Curry). Everybody knows he's a great player, a great scorer. I love a challenge. I love to play against the best. He made some tough shots. I thought I played some good defense, but it was better offense at times. We came out with the win, That's all I really care about at this point."  --  Walker, whose 27 second-half points tied the Bobcats' record for points in a half. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Warriors, who lead the NBA in 3-point shooting at 42.7 percent, made 11 of 37 (29.7 percent) against the Bobcats, their third-worst game of the season. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Charlotte led 77-62 with 3:37 left in the third quarter, only to see Golden State rally to tie the score at 88-88 on a pair of Curry free throws with 8:52 left in the fourth quarter. But Sessions dropped in a pair of layups, then set up Gordon for a 3-pointer over a 70-second span to push the Bobcats' lead back to 95-88 with 6:50 left. The Warriors could pull no closer than two points the rest of the way. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Hey man, the guy (Walker) made big plays down the stretch. He got to the lane and made some tough shots. He kept them just ahead of us. I'm sure that is what they expect him to do, and what he expects to do every night."  --  Curry . 
 
 
 HOT:  Walker single-handedly kept Golden State from following through on its fourth-quarter rally after the Sessions-led push put the Bobcats back in the lead. He hit a 3-pointer, a pair of jumpers and a layup, then closed out the game by going 6 of 8 from the free throw line over the final 25 seconds as Charlotte posted its highest-scoring game of the season. 
 
 NOT:  Golden State's shooting as a team in the first half. While the Warriors finished at 45.6 percent (41 of 90), their two best shooters -- Curry and Thompson -- were a combined 6 of 20 from the field over the first two quarters, including 0 of 8 on 3-pointers. As a team, they were 15 of 43 (34.9 percent) and 1 of 12 on 3-pointers. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "It's disappointing. They got into a rhythm offensively, and we were a step slow. We made a run and started scoring ... but defensively, we needed stops and didn't come up with them. We're a good defensive team, but to give up 115 points to anybody is not acceptable."  --  Warriors head coach  Mark Jackson. 
 
 
 HOT II:  Charlotte's bench, led by Sessions and a season-best game from Gordon, outscored Golden State's reserves 32-10. The Bobcats also turned the ball over a season-low seven times, which forcing the Warriors into 15 turnovers -- leading to a 21-4 points advantage. 
 
 HOT III:  Curry and Thompson in the second half to key the Warriors' comeback. Curry scored 32 points over the final two quarters, going 11 of 21 from the field and 5 of 12 on 3-pointers. Thompson scored 16 second-half points, going 6 of 10 from the field and 4 of 8 on 3s. 
 
 QUOTABLE IV:  "I thought our defense in the first half was the best we've played all year. They are very difficult to guard. The job that Kemba (Walker), Ramon (Sessions), Gerald (Henderson) and Ben (Gordon) did on the perimeter, running around and chasing Steph Curry and Klay Thompson was good."  --  Bobcats head coach  Steve Clifford. 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Bobcats have scored 100 or more points in back-to-back games for the first time this season, and the first time since closing out the 2012-2013 season with wins over the New York Knicks (106-95) and Cleveland Cavaliers (105-98) on March 15-17, 2013. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Warriors, Wednesday vs. Mavericks, Friday vs. Rockets, Sunday @ Suns. For the Bobcats, Wednesday vs. Magic, Friday @ Pacers, Saturday vs. Lakers.
