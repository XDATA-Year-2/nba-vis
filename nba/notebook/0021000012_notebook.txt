
 Bobcats-Mavericks notebook   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday October 27, 2010 11:51PM THE FACTS:  Behind double-doubles by veterans  Dirk Nowitzki  and  Jason Kidd , the Mavericks improved to 13-0 all time against the Bobcats with a season-opening 101-86 victory Wednesday in Dallas. Dallas is the only team Charlotte has not beaten since joining the league in 2004. QUOTABLE:  "I really like the effort. The energy was there, everybody was active on defense and we really tried to make it hard on [ Stephen ]  Jackson  and the other guys because they can really play. It was a great effort from everybody and anytime you hold a team to under 40 percent shooting, you had a good defensive night."   -- Nowitzki on holding Jackson to 14 points and the Bobcats to 39.7 percent shooting. THE STAT:  With 18 assists (and only one turnover),  Jason Kidd  came within one of tying  John Stockton 's NBA record for most assists in a season opener. Stockton had 19 in Utah's 122-113 victory against Denver on Nov. 3, 1989. Kidd added 12 points and three steals. TURNING POINT:  The teams traded runs in the early going, but Dallas delivered the decisive blow. The Mavs scored the game's first 16 points, but Charlotte answered with a 25-4 surge when Dallas coach  Rick Carlisle  went to his bench. With the starters back on the floor, the Mavericks regained control with a 20-5 run wrapped around the intermission. QUOTABLE II:  "That's not new. It's trying to make too many great passes instead of simple passes. When you turn the ball over, you are going to struggle. That's always been our staple."   -- Charlotte coach  Larry Brown  on the team's 21 turnovers, which led to 28 points for Dallas. HOT:  Nowitzki was 11-for-13 from the field, including 8-for-9 in the second half. He finished with a game-high 28 points and a game-high 13 rebounds. Nowitzki also made all six of his free throws to extend his streak to 78 consecutive makes, dating back to March 29, 2010 vs. Denver. NOT:  Bobcats point guard  D.J. Augustin  was locked in from long range in the preseason, shooting 62.5 percent beyond the 3-point line (15-for-24). Against the Mavericks, he was 2-for-10 from the field and 1-for-4 from downtown. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Even though the hometown Texas Rangers were playing at San Francisco in Game 1 of the World Series, and even though there were plenty of empty seats, the game was officially listed as the 359th consecutive regular-season sellout (19,440) at the American Airlines Center. It's the longest-running streak in the NBA. GOOD MOVE:  Former Sixth Man of the Year  Jason Terry , who started at shooting guard for the Mavericks, made his case for staying in the lineup with 22 points on 10-for-15 shooting. Center  Tyson Chandler  also got the start over  Brendan Haywood  and contributed eight points, eight boards and two blocks against his former teammates. ROOKIE WATCH:  Mavericks guard  Dominique Jones  played 8:47 and scored the first two points of his career on a 20-footer at the 11:24 mark of the second quarter. NOTABLE:  The victory snapped a bizarre streak of four consecutive season-opening losses by the Mavs, all at home. Dallas lost to Washington to open 2009-10, Houston in 2008-09 and San Antonio in back-to-back years in 2007-08 and 2006-07. UP NEXT:  For the Bobcats, Friday vs. Pacers, Saturday @ Bucks, Wednesday @ Nets. For the Mavericks, Friday vs. Grizzlies, Sunday @ Clippers, Wednesday @ Nuggets.
