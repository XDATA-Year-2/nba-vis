 THE FACT:  The Clippers have won four straight over the Sixers for the first time since a stretch from March 25-Oct. 31, 1975. 
 
 THE LEAD: Blake Griffin  scored 26 points and grabbed eight rebounds, while  Chris Paul  registered a double-double of 25 points and 13 assists in the Los Angeles Clippers' 94-83 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers Monday night at the Wells Fargo Center.  
 
 DeAndre Jordan  also produced an impressive double-double with 11 points and a season-best 21 rebounds.  Jared Dudley  added 10 points for the Clippers (14-8), who evened their road record at 6-6. 
 
 Evan Turner  paced the Sixers (7-15) with 25 points, while  Thaddeus Young  had 16 points and 11 rebounds.  Tony Wroten  managed 10 rebounds for the reeling Sixers. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We still missed so many open shots, all of us." 
 
 -- Chris Paul, on the win despite shooting 42.7 percent from the field and just 5-for-27 from beyond the arc 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Sixers shot 35.9 percent and dropped to 0-4 this season when shooting below 40 percent. They were 2-14 last season when that happened. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  A 13-0 run to open the third quarter gave the Clippers a 57-36 advantage and it was a large enough lead to hold up. 
 
 HOT:  Paul was 10-for-18, Griffin was 9-for-14 and Jordan knocked down five of his seven shots. 
 
 NOT:  Wroten was 2-for-12,  Hollis Thompson  was 1-for-7 and Hawes missed five of his six shots for the Sixers. The Sixers missed 18 of their 21 shots from 3-point territory. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Clippers kept running their offense. Even though they missed a number of open shots, they were still good shots. In the fourth quarter, Paul hit some key jumpers to even things out. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Sixers continued to settle for long shots and aren't attacking the rim enough. They attempted 19 free throws. Neither Hawes nor Young took a free throw. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  There was a rather lively crowd of 12,355, which included a number of Philadelphia Eagles. Michael Vick, LeSean McCoy and DeSean Jackson were among those who had a courtside seat. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We didn't run one play for him." 
 
 -- Clippers coach  Doc Rivers , on Jordan's 21-rebound performance 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Sixers rookie point guard  Michael Carter-Williams  missed his third straight game because of right knee soreness caused by a skin infection on the front of that knee. Carter-Williams had been at Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and was released Sunday. He remains listed as day-to-day and has now missed seven games this season. ... The Clippers are close to signing free agent forward  Stephen Jackson  and the deal could happen as early as Tuesday, according to Rivers. ... The Clippers have been playing short-handed without guards  Maalik Wayns  (torn meniscus, left knee),  J.J. Redick  (right hand and wrist) and  Reggie Bullock  (sprained left ankle). Forward  Matt Barnes  is also out with a retinal tear in his left eye. ... Turner has scored 20 or more points 16 times this season. ... Jordan picked up his 10th double-double. He has pulled down 16 or more rebounds six times this season. ... The Clippers have scored below 100 points in five of the past 10 games. ... The Clippers are 26-3 all-time when Paul has at least 20 points and 10 assists. ... Hawes failed to reach double figures in scoring for just the second time this season. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "He's always in control. He's never rattled. He's a great point guard and he knows how to get other people involved."
