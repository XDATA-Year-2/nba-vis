  Notebook: Spurs 112, Wizards 97 Posted Monday March 12, 2012 11:55PM By Tim Price, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  The Spurs'  Tony Parker  scored 31 points on 13-for-18 shooting, leading San Antonio to a 54-percent shooting night and a 112-97 victory over the Washington Wizards on Monday at AT&T Center. Tim Duncan  also added 14 points and nine rebounds as he passed  Clyde Drexler  for 25th on the all-time scoring list with 22,207 points in his 15th season for the Spurs (27-13). Although  JaVale McGee  gave up the basket that pushed Duncan past Clyde "The Glide" by not contesting a driving slam dunk in the first quarter, McGee did score 21 points and added 15 rebounds. Washington (9-31) is back in the loss column for the second time in a row after their victory last week against the Lakers. QUOTABLE:  "Tony (Parker) is playing unbelievable. He's playing great. They have to respect Tony, and I'm the other guy."    -- Duncan THE STAT:  The Spurs scored 63 points in the first half, most of those coming rather easily in the paint. The Wizards allowed San Antonio to convert 22-of-29 first-half chances in the paint and lost that battle inside to the tune of 44 points to 14. Also before halftime, San Antonio had 28 baskets overall and 23 assists to set them up. TURNING POINT:  The Spurs led by as much as 18 points, but  Nick Young  hit a 20-footer (he was 7-for-10 on the night, including 4-for-5 from the 3-point line) to cut it to 95-86 with 7:46 to go. A minute and a half later the Spurs brought Parker back into the game, and he penetrated the lane and was fouled to set up a pair of free throws and then scored on a fast break teardrop shot to put the Spurs back up by 13 with six minutes remaining. Wizards coach  Randy Wittman  called timeout, but Washington couldn't cut the margin to single digits the rest of the way. QUOTABLE II:  "We obviously had our hands full. I think Parker is playing as well as anybody in the league right now. Obviously he is a tough cover; I understand that. But we just allowed him to get to the rim time after time."    -- Wittman HOT:  He might not have played the best defense, but McGee sure had a soft touch around the basket tonight. He hit nine of his first 10 shots and now is 16-for-23 the past two games and 22-for-33 (67 percent) the past three. On defense, Duncan finished 7-for-13 with McGee handling the primary duties on him. NOT: John Wall  opened 0-for-6 at the point for Washington, finally making a basket with three minutes to go before halftime. He now has tonight's 5-for-14 finish from the floor and a 1-for-8 last week against the Lakers (6-for-22 total) sandwiched around his 9-for-19 Saturday vs. Portland. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  With  T.J. Ford  announcing his retirement after the stinger he suffered last week -- and the difficulty he had walking off the court -- reminded him of the spinal contusion injury that has caused him so much trouble during his career, it's certain Parker will get plenty of playing time from here on out as long as the injury bug doesn't hit him. He missed Saturday's loss to the Clippers, but in the last three games he's played he's scored an average of 29 points and has 6.7 assists per game. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT II:  With his 21 points and 15 rebounds, McGee has a double-double in two of his last three games. GOOD MOVE:  The consistency Duncan has shown with his outside shot this season paid dividends late. After Parker swung the ball over to him and Duncan squared for what looked to be a wide-open 18-footer, Nick Young ran out to get a hand up. Duncan saw that Young left  Kawhi Leonard  wide open in the corner, so Duncan kept the ball moving and found Leonard for a 3-pointer that gave the Spurs a 13-point led with 3 1/2 minutes to go. BAD MOVE:  The Wizards had cut San Antonio's 18-point lead to single digits, but former Spurs player  Roger Mason Jr.  put up three straight outside shots for Washington and watched them all miss. The Spurs converted two of the three misses into points. ROOKIE WATCH:   Chris Singleton  started his 25th game for the Wizards and had two blocked shots and five rebounds. Leonard scored seven points and had seven rebounds in 27 1/2 minutes for San Antonio. NOTABLE:  Duncan has  Ray Allen  ahead of him in 24th on the career scoring list. Next player who's no longer active is  Elgin Baylor  at No. 23, and he's 942 points ahead of Duncan. ... This marks the 13th-straight loss the Wizards have allowed 100 or more points. ... Against the Wizards the Spurs have won 12 straight overall (dating to November 2005) and 12 in a row (December 1999) at home. ... This was the first of six straight games on the road for Washington. ... The Spurs finished a nine-game road trip before the All-Star break with a record of 8-1. But they're 3-3 on the current seven-game homestand and will be tested to finish it above .500 when the Magic come in Wednesday. ... The Spurs were headed to their best scoring half of the season, looking sure to top the 65 they scored in the first half Feb. 23 at Denver, but they missed their last four foul shots and four of five from the floor to end up with a 63-49 lead at halftime. UP NEXT:  For the Wizards, Tuesday @ Dallas, Thursday @ New Orleans, Friday @ Atlanta. For the Spurs, Wednesday vs. Orlando, Friday @ Oklahoma City, Saturday @ Dallas.
