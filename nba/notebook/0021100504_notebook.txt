  Notebook: Pacers 102, Warriors 78 Posted Tuesday February 28, 2012 10:42PM By Conrad Brunner, for NBA.com THE FACTS: Mark Jackson's  return to Indiana wasn't exactly triumphant. In his first game back as a head coach, Jackson's Warriors fell behind 10-0 out of the gate, setting the tone for a 102-78 rout by the Pacers before 12,111 at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. Indiana (22-12) won its fifth in a row, the team's longest streak since 2005.  Danny Granger  scored 17 of his 25 points in a 33-10 run bridging intermission as the Pacers blew it open, taking a six-point lead and stretching it to 29.  Monta Ellis  and  Brandon Rush  scored 14 apiece for the Warriors (13-18), who had two-game win streak snapped in the absence of point guard  Stephen Curry , who sat out the game to rest a strained tendon in his right foot. QUOTABLE:  "We wanted to come out in the second half and set the tone with a strong effort. We're getting back to being a strong defensive team again. Guys are comfortable with their roles."   -  Indiana head coach  Frank Vogel. THE STAT:  The Pacers held the Warriors to season lows in points, field-goal percentage (.341) and 3-point percentage (.136) TURNING POINT:  After closing the first half on an 8-0 run to build a 52-38 lead, the Pacers opened the second with a 10-2 burst to make it 62-40. Granger had two three-point plays and a 3-point shot as the run grew to 33-10 and the lead to 77-48. QUOTABLE II:  "Tonight was embarrassing."   -  Jackson. HOT:  Granger shot 6 of 9 in the second half and wound up 9 of 18. ...  Paul George  only scored 11 points but did everything else with nine rebounds, five assists and four steals. ...  Tyler Hansbrough  had his second straight strong game off the bench with 15 points and nine boards. NOT:  The Warriors entered the game second in the NBA in 3-point accuracy (.396) but shot 3-of-22. ... Ellis was 7 of 19 overall and missed all four of his 3-pointers, while  Dorell Wright  was 0 of 5 from the arc. ... Golden State's starters combined to shoot 13 of 45 (29 percent), including 0 of 11 from the arc. QUOTABLE III:  "We came out strong, focused and with purpose. Our legs were fairly fresh and everybody in this locker room knew that we had to work hard to get this win. We followed the game plan."   -  George. GOOD MOVE:  When Jackson brought Rush into the game early in the third quarter to try to stem Indiana's run, Vogel left George on Ellis, assigning the 6-2  Darren Collison  to guard the 6-6 Rush. George smothered Ellis defensively with four steals in the third period alone as Golden State's leading score made just one of six shots. BAD MOVE:  With Curry out, Jackson opted to start  Charles Jenkins  at the point instead of veteran  Nate Robinson . Jenkins had two points, two assists and shot 0 of 5 in 18 minutes. NOTABLE:  In their win streak, the Pacers have outscored opponents by 17.6 points and outrebounded them by 10.2 per game. ... Indiana had a season-high 26 fast-break points and scored at least 100 for a season-best fourth straight game. ... Golden State is in the midst of its longest road trip of the year, six games sandwiching the All-Star break. ... Rush was typically low-key about his first game back in Indiana since being trade to the Warriors for  Lou Amundson  prior to the season. "I look at this thing as a business," Rush said. "You can't take anything personal." ... Jackson was back in Indiana for the first time as a coach. The former point guard helped direct the Pacers to four Eastern Conference Finals and one NBA Finals in from 1995-2000.
