  Notebook: Pacers 105, Bucks 99 Posted Sunday April 15, 2012 12:11AM By Rick Braun, for NBA.com THE FACTS: Roy Hibbert  scored 23 points, including six free throws in the last 1:14, and grabbed 14 rebounds to lead the Indiana Pacers to a 105-99 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks Saturday night at the Bradley Center. The loss was crushing for the Bucks (29-31), who now trail Philadelphia by 2 1/2 games for the final playoff spot in the East. The Bucks have six games left, while Philadelphia has seven. The two teams will meet in Milwaukee on April 25. Danny Granger  added 21 points for Indiana (38-22), which is solidly in the playoffs with the No. 3 seed in the East. Monta Ellis  led the Bucks with 20 points, and  Brandon Jennings  had 16 points and 10 assists but the Bucks missed five straight shots down the stretch and never got back to even after trailing 59-48 at the half. QUOTABLE:  "It's tough. You want to protect your home court always. That's been something that's been our weakness all season is losing close games at home and not taking advantage of the home-court advantage."   -- Bucks center  Drew Gooden  on his team's struggles at home THE STAT:  The Bucks outscored the Pacers by two points from the field and both teams attempted 26 free throws. But the Bucks made just 16 of their freebies while the Pacers poured in 24. TURNING POINT:  The Bucks pulled within a point at 90-89 with a 7-0 run that was capped by Ellis' layup with 6:58 left. The Pacers called a timeout and drew up a play for Granger to post up. When the double-team came, Granger fed  George Hill  at the top of the key for a 3-pointer that broke Milwaukee's momentum. The Bucks never got closer than three the rest of the way. QUOTABLE II:  "We obviously missed some. I missed three, which is unusual for me."   -- Bucks swingman  Mike Dunleavy  on Milwaukee's poor free-throw shooting HOT:  Hibbert's 7-for-14 from the field wasn't that notable, but his 9-for-10 performance at the foul line included 6 for 6 in the final 1:14. NOT:  Gooden had a big game with 12-of-18 shooting Friday night in a victory at Detroit but could only muster a 2-for-10 night on Saturday. GOOD MOVE:  After the Bucks seized the momentum and pulled within a point midway through the fourth, Indiana coach  Frank Vogel  called a timeout and drew up a play for Granger that led to Hill's big 3-pointer. BAD MOVE:  Bucks second-year forward  Larry Sanders  contributed eight points, six rebounds and three blocked shots along with a lot of energy. But when he found himself with the ball near the free-throw line after an offensive rebound by Ellis, he tried to force a pass to a cutting Jennings that was well off-target and went out of bounds for a costly turnover with 2:58 left and the Bucks trailing, 99-96. NOTABLE:  While the Bucks have gone 8-1 in their last nine road games, they're a miserable 8-13 in their last 21 at home. ... Pacers point guard  Darren Collison  missed his fourth straight game with a strained groin. ... Jennings recorded 10 assists in back-to-back games for the first time in his career. He also had season highs with eight rebounds and three blocked shots. ... Granger scored at least 18 points for the 11th consecutive game. ... The Pacers made 12 of their first 14 shots (85.7 percent) but went just 25 for 78 (32.1 percent) the rest of the way. ... Indiana's  Leandro Barbosa  went 3 for 5 on 3-pointers and 0 for 7 inside the arc. ... There appears to be some bad blood developing between the teams. There were two double-technical fouls (Hibbert and Sanders, 1:58, and Jennings and Granger 10.3 seconds) in the final two minutes and a flagrant foul against Indiana's  David West , who smacked Dunleavy in the head on a drive in the second quarter. In the previous game three weeks ago, Dunleavy and Indiana's  Tyler Hansbrough  tangled and were hit with matching technicals. UP NEXT:  For the Pacers, Monday vs. Minnesota, Tuesday @ Philadelphia, Thursday vs. Milwaukee. For the Bucks, Wednesday @ Washington, Thursday @ Indiana, Saturday vs. New Jersey.
