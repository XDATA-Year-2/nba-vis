
 Rockets-Knicks notebook   By Adam Zagoria, for NBA.com Posted Sunday November 14, 2010 10:15PM THE FACTS:   Kevin Martin  scored 28 points and  Luis Scola  had 24 as the Houston Rockets handed the Knicks their fifth straight loss, 104-96,   at Madison Square Garden. QUOTABLE:  "I felt good. Something about playing in the Garden. I love playing in the Garden."  -  Martin on his big game against the Knicks THE STAT:  The Knicks shot 3-for-16 from beyond the arc for the game and were outscored 14-4 to close the third period. TURNING POINT:  After a 3-pointer by  Raymond Felton  put the Knicks up 71-70 in the third period, the Rockets ran off a 7-0 run to go ahead 77-71 and never looked back. New York missed six shots during the spurt. QUOTABLE II:  "I don't understand why we're not playing with the urgency. I don't understand that ... It's not something I'm used to."  --  Knicks forward  Amar'e Stoudemire , who had 25 points on 10 of 19 shooting HOT:  Martin, who came in averaging 23.6 points, killed the Knicks with 28 points on 8 of 18 shooting. He has scored 20 or more points in eight of nine games this season, with a season-high 31 in a loss to Washington. NOT:   Toney Douglas  continued to struggle for the Knicks, making just 1 of 11 shots for three points. After dropping a career-high 30 points at Chicago on Nov. 4 and following that up with back-to-back double-figure games, Douglas has failed to reach double-digit scoring in four straight games. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Musician  Robert Randolph  and former Sopranos star  Edie Falco  sat courtside. ROOKIE WATCH:  Starting shooting guard  Landry Fields  continues to excel for the Knicks, scoring 12 points on 5 of 6 shooting. NOTABLE:  Knicks coach  Mike D'Antoni  and Rockets coach  Rick Adelman  were teammates with the Kansas City-Omaha Kings during the 1974-5 season. UP NEXT:  For the Knicks, Tuesday @ Denver, Wednesday @ Sacramento, Friday @ Golden STate. For the Rockets, Tuesday vs. Chicago, Wednesday at Oklahoma City, Friday at Toronto.
