 THE FACTS:   Jordan Crawford  had 19 points as six Washington Wizards scored in double figures in a 114-101 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday night. 
 The win was Washington's sixth in the past nine games. The Wizards led throughout.  Bradley Beal  scored 16 points.  John Wall  and  Nene  each had 14.  Martel Webster  had 13 and  Kevin Seraphin  had 10. 
 The loss was Minnesota's eighth in its past nine games.  Derrick Williams  led the Timberwolves with 18 points. 
 
 QUOTABLE: "I don't know. I just know I'm feeling no pain-not having no pains or having no setbacks." 
 - Wall on how close he is to 100 percent after starting his first game of the season. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Wizards shot 57.8 percent. "You can't just give them all the credit for their shooting. They did shoot the ball well, but we didn't play good defense," Minnesota guard  Luke Ridnour  said.  
 
 TURNING POINT:  After the Timberwolves closed to within 47-42 with 4:05 remaining in the first half, Washington went on a 13-4 run to end the half up 60-46. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:   "To be good, we need to lose and we need to learn. We did it." 
 - Nene on his team's early-season struggles. 
 
 
 HOT:  Webster was 5-for-7 from the field and 3-for-4 from 3-point range. 
 
 NOT:  Minnesota's  Ricky Rubio  was 1-for-8 in a season-high 31 minutes. "We couldn't find our rhythm plus they were hitting every shot," Rubio said.  
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Wizards coach  Randy Wittman  started Wall for the first time this season. "He has his legs under him a little, but he's still not where he needs to be," Wittman said. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Timberwolves trying to play defense on Washington. Minnesota allowed the most points it allowed all season. "I think we had a lot of breakdowns tonight," acting coach  Terry Porter  said. 
 
 NOTABLE:   Thanks to the win, the Wizards no longer have the worst record in the league. Washington is 10-31, and Charlotte is 10-32. 
 
 IN THE ARENA:  The Wizards play the first of three home back-to-backs this season on Saturday when they host Chicago.  
 
 NEXT:   Timberwolves: Saturday vs.Bobcats, Wednesday vs. Cliipers,  Feb. 1 vs. Lakers; Wizards:  Saturday vs. Bulls, Monday vs. Kings, Wednesday @ Sixers
