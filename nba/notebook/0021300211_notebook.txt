 THE FACT:  The Nets entered play Tuesday with the worst third-quarter plus-minus in the NBA at -67. They outscored the Raptors 26-25 in the third quarter and are now 4-0 when they outscore an opponent in that frame this season.  
 
 THE LEAD:  The Brooklyn Nets (4-10) withstood a late run by the Toronto Raptors (6-8), holding on for a 102-100 victory and snapping a five-game losing skid in the process.  Andray Blatche  led the way for Brooklyn, scoring 24 points on 10-for-16 from the floor.  Joe Johnson  had 21 and veteran  Paul Pierce  finished with 16. 
 
 DeMar DeRozan  was once again the standout for the Raptors, scoring 27 points with an efficient 15 shots.  Kyle Lowry  was also big for Toronto, scoring 21 points and dishing six assists.  
 With 3:13 left in the game and the Nets leading 101-86,  Steve Novak  was fouled on a 3-point attempt, sparking what would be a 14-1 run for the Raptors.  
 
 Amir Johnson  missed a potential game-winning 3 in the final seconds and Novak missed the follow-up tip in to seal the win for the Nets.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Well it sort of seems like we wanted time to run out instead of going out there and putting the stamp on the thing and that's what we have to do -- we have to continue to do what we do and push the lead, and not wait for the clock to run out. I thought we were tentative in our offense, we turned the ball over and fortunately we built such a big lead, or if it was any closer we would have lost it." 
 -- Paul Pierce 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Brooklyn outscored Toronto 28-10 in the paint in the first half.  
 
 TURNING POINT:   After a  Terrence Ross  layup cut the Net lead to just five at 83-78, Brooklyn responded by going on a 18-8 run, putting it up 101-86. This was just enough to hold off Toronto's late 14-1 push.  
 
 HOT:   DeRozan scored a game-high 27 points on 9-for-15 shooting from the field. He also shot 4-for-6 from beyond the arc.  
 
 HOT I I :  Blatche was a handful for the Raptors to defend in the paint. He scored 24 points in 32 minutes and did so efficiently, taking just 16 shots.  
 
 NOT:   Rudy Gay  had one of the worst games of his season thus far, making just 3-for-12 from the field and turning the ball over a game-high seven times.  
 
 BAD MOVE:  Raptors coach  Dwane Casey  went to a five-man lineup of Ross,  D.J. Augustin , Novak,  Landry Fields  and  Tyler Hansbrough  to begin the fourth quarter. This all-reserve lineup failed to give the Raptors the spark they needed, going -4 in 3:19.  
 
 NOTABLE: Deron Williams  (ankle),  Brook Lopez  (ankle),  Andrei Kirilenko  (back) and  Jason Terry  (knee) all missed Tuesday's contest. Those four players have missed a combined 20 games this season... Tennis Canada's player of the year  Milos Roanic  was in attendance... Raptors forward  Quincy Acy  (ankle) missed his third straight game...  Kevin Garnett  played in his 1,336th career game passing  Gary Payton  for ninth place on the NBA's all-time list.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Raptors, Friday vs. Miami, Sunday vs. Denver, Tuesday @ Golden State. For the Nets, Wednesday vs. L.A Lakers, Friday @ Houston, Saturday @Memphis.
