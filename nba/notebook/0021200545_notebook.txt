 THE FACTS: Al Jefferson  had 20 points and 10 rebounds as the Utah Jazz rallied from an early 15-point deficit to defeat the Detroit Pistons 90-87 at The Palace of Auburn Hills on Saturday.  Randy Foye  and  Paul Millsap  added 17 points apiece for Utah (20-19), which led by 13 with less than four minutes left and then held off the Pistons' late rally.  Brandon Knight  led the Pistons (14-24) with 16 points and  Will Bynum  had 13, all in the fourth quarter.  Greg Monroe  chipped in 12 points but only had two in the second half. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "Once we go inside-out, they can carry us a little bit. We wanted to make sure we moved it from one side to the other, so they couldn't just key in on one side." 
 -- Jazz swingman  Gordon Hayward  on Jefferson and Millsap, who scored 23 second-half points 
 
 THE STAT : 10. The Jazz has won an NBA-high 10 games after trailing by double figures. The closest to Utah is Memphis and Phoenix, who have six victories apiece after getting down by double digits. Utah didn't take its first lead until late in the third quarter on a Jefferson jumper. The Jazz bounced back from an eight-point loss at Atlanta on Friday in which they squandered a 15-point lead.  
 
 TURNING POINT : The Pistons were up 54-41 early in the third, but Utah tied the game with a 15-2 run. Jefferson scored eight of his points during that stretch and Foye finished it with a 3-pointer. Detroit did not lead by more than three the remainder of the game. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "We don't give in. We don't crack. Some nights we might not have it offensively, but we always give effort and try to play as hard as we can on the defensive end."  
 -- Randy Foye 
 
 HOT : Jefferson had his third straight game of at least 20 points, averaging 23 during that stretch. He has also averaged 9.3 rebounds and sparked Utah's defense Saturday with four steals. 
 
 NOT : Monroe, who scored 26 points at Milwaukee on Friday, was neutralized by the Jazz's frontcourt after halftime. He attempted just two shots while committing five turnovers. Overall, he made seven of Detroit's 17 turnovers. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH : Detroit center  Andre Drummond  had nine points and five rebounds. He led all qualifying rookies in rebounding (7.3) and blocks (1.7) entering the game. He has also moved into the league's top 10 with 55 dunks. Pistons guard  Kyle Singler  only scored four points in 20 minutes. 
 
 NOTABLE : Pistons guard  Rodney Stuckey  had nine points, leaving him two shy of 5,000 for his career. ... The Jazz has won 13 of the last 14 meetings. The teams will meet again March 11 in Utah, where the Pistons haven't won since Nov. 6, 2002. ... Utah plays 10 of its next 12 at home, beginning with Miami on Monday. ... Jazz forward  Marvin Williams  missed his third straight game with right knee inflammation. He could return sometime next week, according to coach  Ty Corbin . ... Both teams shot over 50 percent and had the same amount of individual rebounds (32), assists (21) and fouls (22). 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Jazz, Monday vs. Miami, Saturday vs. Cleveland, Wednesday -- Jan. 23 vs. Washington. For the Pistons, Thursday vs. New York (London), Sunday -- Jan. 20 vs. Boston, Tuesday -- Jan. 22 vs. Orlando.
