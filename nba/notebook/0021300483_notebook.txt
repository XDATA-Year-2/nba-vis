 THE FACT: Andre Iguodala  hit a game-ending buzzer-beating 3 against the Hawks to give the Warriors their first sweep of back-to-back games this season. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Iguodala's game-winning three-pointer capped a 15-point rally as the Golden State Warriors (22-13) stunned the Atlanta Hawks, 101-100, Friday night at Philips Arena. The 3-pointer capped a 25-9 run over the final 6:48. The win was Golden State's eighth straight win and fourth straight over the Hawks (18-15) 
 Iguodala, who finished with seven points, inbounded to  Stephen Curry  some 30 feet out on the left side with 3.2 seconds to play. When Atlanta center  Pero Antic  left Iguodala to double Curry, the Warriors guard gave Iguodala a return pass, allowing him to hit the game-winner.  David Lee  led Golden State with a game-high 23 points, while Curry finished with 22 points, eight rebounds and nine assists.  Klay Thompson  completed the triumvirate of Warriors 20-point scorers, with 21. No other Warrior scored in double figures. Antic, making his first start of the season, led Atlanta with 16, including a 3 with 6:48 left to play that gave Atlanta a 91-76 lead, before Golden State rallied.  Paul Millsap  added a 12-point, 11-rebound double-double for the Hawks.  
 
 THE STAT:  3-for-6: Golden State's three-point shooting over the final 6:48. The Warriors, who went 9-for-13 shots down the stretch, had made only 3 of their previous 21 from behind the arc. 
 
 TURNING POINT : Following the Antic 3 that gave Atlanta its biggest lead, Golden State's defense came to life and gave the Warriors life. They got back-to-back stops, forcing a pair of  Jeff Teague  missed jumpers, and held Atlanta to one field goal the rest of the way. The Hawks had scored on eight of their first nine fourth-quarter possessions.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Great teams don't make excuses and we're trying to become great, which makes me even more proud of them. This team has no quit." --  Golden State  c oach  Mark Jackson 
 
 
 HOT:  Curry got hot in the fourth quarter, scoring 14 points on 5-of-9 shooting. Although he never got his rhythm from three (1-for-7 for the game), he pulled down five rebounds and dished out five assists in the 12 minutes...Credit Lee (9-of-16) and Thompson (8-for-17, 3-for-7 from 3) for keeping the Warriors in the game until Curry got going.   
 
 NOT:  Golden State 3-point shooting. Had Iguodala not hit the big shot at the end, the Warriors' downfall would have been their shooting from downtown. They made six on 22.2 percent shooting (6-for-27) ? they average 9.6 per game (tied for second in the league), on 39.7 percent shooting (third). After Thompson made his first three 3-point field goal attempts, all within the game's first 6:55, Golden State missed its next 18 tries...Millsap, who averaged 25.8 ppg over his previous five games on 50 percent shooting (44-for-88) proved human, scoring 12 points, making only 3-for-14 (21.4). He made more free throws (6) than field goals (3). 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Antic was in line to be Atlanta's hero. His fulfilled the Hawks' objective of pulling Golden State big  Andrew Bogut  away from the basket, making 4-of-6 from behind the arc on his way to his 16 points -- all career highs. Antic's four 3-pointers were a game-high. He also had career highs in rebounds (7) and defensive rebounds (6). 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Even if I scored 16 points or a career high, at the end, I made a mistake. We lost the game and I feel bad."  --  Antic 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Iguodala's game-winner is his second this season and the fifth of his career according to Elias, which categorizes it as shots within the final three seconds...The two teams combined for 41 turnovers (G.S., 21, ATL, 20), which netted them 37 points (GS, 22, ATL, 15)... Kyle Korver  extended his streak of at least one 3-pointer to 102 straight games, drilling his first attempt 30 seconds in...The game had 14 lead changes and 11 ties, five of each coming in the second quarter, when the teams shot identical 9-for-23 (39.1 percent)...Atlanta hit the century mark for the 10th time in 11 games...The Hawks handed out 23 assists, the 31st time they've done so in 33 games... Shelvin Mack  had a big night off the bench, scoring 15, with three steals in 26 minutes...  Elton Brand  moved past  James Worthy  into 96th place all-time in NBA history in scoring...The Hawks made 15 steals, marking the 10th time this season they've made at least 10. The 15 thefts, via eight different players, were one off the season-high. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Hawks, Saturday @ Chicago, Monday @ Brooklyn, Wednesday vs. Indiana. For the Warriors, Sunday @ Washington, Tuesday @ Milwaukee, Wednesday @ Brooklyn.
