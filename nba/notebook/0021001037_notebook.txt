  Knicks-Bucks notebook   By Rick Braun, for NBA.com Posted Sunday March 20, 2011 7:00PM THE FACTS:   Carlos Delfino  topped his season high for the second straight, this time scoring a career-best 30 and adding 11 rebounds, and  Brandon Jennings  came one assist shy of a triple-double with 14 points and 11 rebounds to lead the Milwaukee Bucks to a 100-95 victory over the New York Knicks Sunday at the Bradley Center. QUOTABLE:  "I'll never forget that I was almost out for the season with an injury, so every single day I'm so happy to answer the call."  --  Delfino, who missed 2 1/2 months from early November to the middle of January with post-concussive syndrome. THE STAT:  Starters carried nearly all the load for the Bucks, scoring 98 of the team's 100 points. The only reserve to score for the Bucks was rookie  Larry Sanders , who dunked with 9:53 left in the second quarter.  Andrew Bogut  (39:45) was the only Bucks starter to not play 40 minutes. TURNING POINT:  The Bucks led from the first basket of the game, building a 23-point lead in the first quarter, but the game was not decided until the final minutes, as New York kept fighting back. Delfino made two free throws with 2:13 left and followed that with his sixth and final 3-pointer 30 seconds later to turn an 86-84 edge into 91-84, and that allowed the Bucks to withstand three 3-pointers in the final 1:11. The Bucks also were helped by the fact that  Chauncey Billups  fouled out with 2:46 left, eliminating one of the league's top clutch players. QUOTABLE II:  "He normally gets about the same looks every night. Like a lot of players, when he sees a couple go in early he loosens up a little bit, and then he can have these games. He's had two in a row, now, but he can have these games sprinkled in where he gets really hot, and that's obviously big for us."  --  Bucks coach  Scott Skiles  on Delfino's shooting. HOT:  Delfino's 8-of-13 performance (6 of 11 on 3-pointers) comes on the heels of a 9-of-13 night on Friday where he made 8 of 11 threes for 26 points. That makes him 65.4 percent (17 of 26) over the last two games and 63.6 percent (14 of 22) on 3-pointers. NOT:  Knicks guard  Toney Douglas  went just 3 for 13 off the bench, but did have nine assists. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Jennings knew he needed one assist for a triple-double, but in a tight game he said he wasn't going to pass up an open shot just to get the 10th assist. His pullup jumper with 26.1 seconds was huge, and he added a free throw with 16.1 seconds to finish with 14 points, 11 rebounds, nine assists and one steal. ROOKIE WATCH:   Landry Fields  had 13 points, including three 3-pointers, in 21 minutes for the Knicks. NOTABLE:  Bucks forward  Drew Gooden , who has missed the last 26 games and 43 overall with plantar fasciitis in his left foot, said before the game he hopes to return for Wednesday's game against Sacramento...  Luc Richard Mbah a Moute  was just two points short of his career high with 19, going 13 for 13 from the line... John Salmons  had his second straight 20-plus game for the Bucks with 22 points...Bogut had a double-double with 13 points and 12 rebounds ... Amar'e Stoudemire  led the Knicks with 25,  Carmelo Anthony  added 23 and Billups had 21, but New York fell to 7-8 since the arrival of Anthony and Billups in the most-heralded trade of the season...The Knicks actually took good care of the ball while falling behind, 32-9, after a quarter. Shooting was the problem, as they made just 4 of 25 (16 percent) first-period tries...The Bucks (28-41) pulled even with Charlotte for the ninth spot and are 1 1/2 games behind Indiana (30-30) for the final playoff spot in the East. UP NEXT:  For the Knicks, Monday vs. Boston, Wednesday vs. Orlando, Friday vs. Milwaukee. For the Bucks, Wednesday vs. Sacramento, Friday @ New York, Saturday vs. Chicago.
