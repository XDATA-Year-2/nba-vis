 THE FACTS: Kobe Bryant  scored all of his 20 points in the second half as the Los Angeles Lakers rallied from a 20-point deficit to defeat the Charlotte Bobcats 100-93 Friday night at Time Warner Cable Arena.  Byron Mullens  and  Gerald Henderson  scored 20 each, as well, to lead the Bobcats who have lost six in a row.  
 
 QUOTABLE : "We started getting into a good rhythm and started to make some shots that we were missing in the first half and, defensively, we became a little more solid. We had to get on track and stop worrying about what we're doing individually. Just focus on what we're doing collectively as a group and just play for that." 
 -- Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant 
 
 THE STAT : Scoreless halves. The Lakers' (24-27) two biggest stars were each held scoreless for one half tonight. Bryant was 0-for-2 in the first half with zero points. It was the first time he was held scoreless in the first half since March 31, 2012. His first field goal was at the 8:47 mark of the third quarter. Los Angeles outscored Charlotte 55-29.  Dwight Howard  was held to a similar fate in the second half. The Lakers' center had 12 points and eight rebounds at the break and finished the night with 12 points and 11 rebounds.  
 
 TURNING POINT : The Lakers used a quick 7-0 spurt late in the fourth quarter to complete the comeback.  Jodie Meeks  drilled a three pointer to give the Lakers a 92-91 lead with 3:02 to play. Bryant capped the 7-0 run with a pair of free throws with 1:29 to play to take the 96-91 lead. Charlotte (11-38) would get as close as three with a  Ramon Session  layup. For the final 12 minutes, the Lakers outscored Charlotte 31-15 and held the Bobcats to 7-for-21 shooting (33.3 percent).  
 
 QUOTABLE II : "Hopefully, this will be a wake-up call. Again. For the 80th time." 
 -- Los Angeles Lakers coach  Mike D'Antoni 
 
 HOT: Bryant was 4-for-7 from the floor in the fourth quarter and almost outscored the Bobcats by himself. The Lakers guard finished with 14 points, just one point less than Charlotte. Bryant was a perfect 6-for-6 from the charity stripe and is 15-for-15 from the free-throw line in the last two fourth quarters.  
 
 NOT : The Bobcats folded down the stretch and made just one of their final seven shots while allowing the Lakers to go 3-for-5 down the stretch.  
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT : Mullens returned to the Bobcats staring lineup with a solid outing. The Bobcats' power forward had been sideline until recently with a sprained ankle and returned to action during the team's five-game roadtrip. Mullens finished the night with 20 points and 12 rebounds while adding an assist, a steal and a blocked shot. Mullens has scored in double figures in each of his three games since returning to the lineup.  
 
 ROOKIE WATCH: Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  returned to action after sustaining a concussion and scored four points, grabbed 10 rebounds and had two assists. Fellow rookie  Jeffery Taylor  finished with two points on a monstrous alley-oop. The Lakers lone rookie,  Robert Sacre , did not see any action, but was active. 
 
 NOTABLE : The Bobcats have now blown two big leads against the Lakers this season. Charlotte led by 20 Friday and also led the Lakers by 18 on December 18 before losing 101-100. ... Session had 12 points and seven assists against his former team. The Bobcats had four players with double figure rebounds for the first time in franchise history (Mullens with 12,  Bismack Biyombo , Henderson and Kidd-Gilchrist each with 10). Henderson had his first double-double of the season. ...  Kemba Walker  scored in double figures for the 19th time in the last 20 games. ... Bryant has scored in double figures in all 51 games this season and has reached 20 or more 42 times. ... Howard registered his 25th double-double this season. ... Charlotte native  Antawn Jamison  returned home and scored nine points and grabbed five assists. ... Bryant has made just one 3-point basket since January 20. He is one for his last 26 from behind the arc. .. At 23-28, this is only the 3rd time since the ABA-NBA merger that the Lakers are below .500 through 51 games. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Lakers, Sunday @ Miami, Tuesday vs. Phoenix, Thursday vs. Clippers. For the Bobcats, Saturday @ Philadelphia, Monday vs. Boston, Wednesday @ Indiana.
