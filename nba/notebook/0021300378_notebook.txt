 THE FACT:  Coming into the game, the San Antonio Spurs'  Tim Duncan  had played 37 more career minutes than the entire Phoenix Suns' roster combined: 42,064 compared to 42,027. 
 
 THE LEAD:  The Spurs went where few teams have gone in games involving the Suns this season: They slowed down the Suns' dual-point-guard backcourt of  Goran Dragic  and  Eric Bledsoe . And that allowed the visiting Spurs (20-5) to outlast the Suns 108-101 Wednesday night to snap Phoenix's five-game winning streak. 
 With 5:10 left, the Suns led 95-93, but the Spurs scored 13 of the next 17 points to take a 106-97 lead with 20 seconds left.  Manu Ginobili  started started the run with a tip-in and a 3-pointer. 
 Ginobili led the Spurs with a season-high 24 points. Duncan had 17 points and 13 boards. 
 
 Channing Frye  led the Suns (14-10) with 22 points. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "There was no special defense that I'm aware of that others aren't. It was effort, good reads and focus. We did switch up defenses quite often to keep them off balance. Other than that, it was great effort."  
 -- Spurs coach  Gregg Popovich  on how they were able to slow the Dragic-Bledsoe combo 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Spurs held the Suns to just 43 points on 36 percent shooting in the second half. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Ginobili's 3-pointer from the right corner broke a 95-95 tie with 2:58 left. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Coach really doesn't have to say much. These guys know what to do."  
 -- Forward  Jeff Ayres , a recent addition to the Spurs 
 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "We have the same team we always have. We haven't changed much over the years; we do the same stuff. We only have one goal. It's always to be the best team we can be at the last day of the season. Usually at this point in the season we are OK, a little bit above average, but not the best for sure."  
 -- Gregg Popovich 
 
 
 HOT:  The Suns' Frye was 4-for-4 on 3-pointers. 
 
 NOT:  Dragic and Bledsoe combined to shoot 12-for-33. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Popovich sent in  Boris Diaw  to quiet Frye early in the third quarter with the score tied 65-65. The Spurs quickly pulled ahead, and Frye scored only four points the rest of the way.  
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  The Suns' Archie Goodwin shot 3-for-4 for seven points in 15 minutes. By contrast, big man  Alex Len , the No. 5 overall pick in the draft, has played just 31 minutes in four games for the Suns. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Sixth man  Gerald Green  isn't giving the Suns the same lift off the bench that he did earlier. Over his last six games, he has shot 14-for-43 while averaging 7.0 points. He has only gotten to the line nine times in those six games, none Wednesday. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Spurs entered the game averaging 46.1 points off the bench (No. 2) in the league, while the Suns averaged 35.5 (No. 8). In this game, the Spurs doubled up the Suns 58-29 in bench scoring. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Spurs, Thursday @ Golden State, Saturday vs. Oklahoma City, Monday vs. Toronto. For the Suns, Friday @ Denver, Saturday vs. Dallas, Monday vs. L.A. Lakers.
