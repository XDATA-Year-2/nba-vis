
 Bobcats-Wizards notebook   By John Mitchell, for NBA.com Posted Friday November 12, 2010 10:49PM THE FACTS:  The Charlotte Bobcats pounded the Washington Wizards relentlessy on the glass, out-rebounding them 48-30 to string together consecutive wins for the first time this season with a 93-85 victory at Verizon Center. Gerald Wallace  led the Bobcats (3-6) with 25 points and 14 rebounds. He provided the most electric play of the night in the fourth quarter when he chased down Washington rookie  John Wall  (13 points, 11 assists) and blocked what looked as if it might be an uncontested layup. Charlotte's  D.J. Augustin  more than held his own against Wall on the way to 17 points and 10 assists.  Andray Blatche  led Washington (2-6) with 22 points and nine rebounds. QUOTABLE:  "We have to finish games out. This is starting to become the same old bad story at the end of games. I'm running out of patience."   --   Blatche  after Washington managed just two field goals in the final 6:57 THE STAT:  The Hornets were so dominant on the boards that they were able to survive turning the ball over a season-high 24 times. . TURNING POINT:  With the score tied 78-78 with 6:10 left in the game, the Hornets scored eight unanswered points to put the game away. QUOTABLE II:  "They are going to be terrific. There is some great young talent over there and they have a good coaching staff to boot. It's going to take time."   --  Bobcats coach  Larry Brown  on the Wizards HOT:   Wallace continued his hot play in Washington. Wallace posted his fourth double-double of the season in the win over Washington and has now grabbed 28 rebounds in the Bobcats last two games. ROOKIE WATCH:  Wall notched his fourth double-double of the season. NOTABLE:  All but two of Wall's 11 assists came before halftime. . UP NEXT:  For the wizards, Saturday at Chicago, Tuesday vs. Toronto, Wednesday at Boston. For the Bobcats, Saturday vs. Utah, Tuesday vs. Minnesota, next Saturday at Miami.
