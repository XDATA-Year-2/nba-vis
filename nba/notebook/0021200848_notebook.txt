 THE FACTS: Monta Ellis  scored 11 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter Tuesday as the Milwaukee Bucks survived a vintage performance by  Dirk Nowitzki  and escaped with a 95-90 win against the Dallas Mavericks at the American Airlines Center. 
 Five players scored in double figures for the Bucks (27-28), who overcame a five-point deficit in the final 3:12 to snap their three-game losing streak. Nowitzki led six Mavericks in double figures with 21 points and a season-high 20 rebounds, his first 20-20 effort in nearly a decade, but Dallas (25-31) missed eight of its last nine shots. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Monta was incredible all night long. He was all over the floor. Some of the steals he had were just amazing. There are not many guys who can do that. The way he's able to pick people's pockets and get his hands on some balls. The energy he played with was the difference." 
 -- Bucks coach  Jim Boylan 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The only 3-pointer made by the Mavericks (1-for-17) came on Nowitzki's four-point play with 9:04 remaining in the game. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  One trip down the court will be particularly painful for the Mavericks to watch on tape. Tied at 88-88, Dallas attacked the offensive glass and managed to get four cracks at the basket on the same possession but came away empty with a missed jumper by  Darren Collison , two 3-point misses by  O.J. Mayo  and a fumble by Nowitzki. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Basically, our collective will has got to be stronger." 
 -- Mavericks coach  Rick Carlisle 
 
 
 HOT:  Milwaukee was 10-for-11 at the foul line in the final quarter to hold off the Mavericks, including Ellis' 3-for-3 effort. ...  Elton Brand  had 12 points on 6-for-8 shooting and 14 rebounds off the Dallas bench for his seventh double-double. ...  Larry Sanders  had 13 points and 13 boards for the Bucks. 
 
 NOT:  Mavericks sixth man  Vince Carter  was 0-for-8, including 0-for-4 from 3-point range, and finished with two points, three turnovers and four personal fouls. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Coming off his first double-double of the season in Sunday's loss against the Lakers, Nowitzki made it two straight. It was his sixth career 20-20 game and first since April 3, 2003 against the Lakers (25 points, 22 rebounds). Nowitzki was 8-for-16 from the field with three assists and two steals. It was his 50th career game with 15 or more boards. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Milwaukee center  Samuel Dalembert  served a one-game suspension for a violation of team policies. ... Collison's missed free throw at 9:04 of the third quarter snapped a streak of 41 consecutive makes over a 14-game span, dating back to Jan. 18 vs. Oklahoma City. ... The Mavericks scored the first 11 points of the game. ... The Bucks snapped a four-game road losing streak. ... Nowitzki needs two field goals to pass  Larry Bird  (8,591) for 21st place on the all-time list. ... This is just the second time Dallas has lost at home when leading entering the fourth quarter (15-2). ... The Mavericks play seven of their next eight games, and eight of 10, on the road. ... Dallas outscored Milwaukee 52-30 in the paint. ... The Mavericks matched a season high with 16 offensive rebounds. ... The Bucks scored 19 points off 20 Dallas turnovers. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Wednesday @ Memphis, Friday @ Brooklyn, Sunday @ Houston. For the Bucks, Wednesday @ Houston, Saturday vs. Toronto, Monday vs. Utah.
