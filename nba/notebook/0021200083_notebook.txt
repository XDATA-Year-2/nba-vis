 THE FACTS: Kemba Walker  scored a game-high 26 points and the Charlotte Bobcats fought back from a double-digit deficit in the second half to beat the Dallas Mavericks 101-97 in overtime Saturday night at Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte, N.C. 
 
 Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  added a career-high 25 points and 12 rebounds for the Bobcats (2-3), who beat the Mavericks for the first time in the franchise's nine-year history, ending a 16-game losing streak against the 2011 NBA champions. 
 
 O.J. Mayo  scored 22 points,  Vince Carter  came off the bench to add 19 points,  Darren Collison  had 14 and  Elton Brand  10 for the Mavericks, who led 59-44 with 10:39 left in the third quarter. But the Bobcats fought back to briefly lead twice in the fourth quarter, and overcame a four-point deficit in the final 22 seconds of regulation on a  Brendan Haywood  dunk and  Ramon Sessions  layup with 2.8 seconds remaining. 
 
 Byron Mull e ns , who had a game-best 14 rebounds, then put the Bobcats ahead in overtime with his dunk with 3:18 remaining. Walker stretched Charlotte's lead to 97-93 with a layup with 1:30 left, and Kidd-Gilchrist and Sessions both hit free throws in the final 19 seconds to seal the win. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We gave up way too many points to them the last time we played. But our players made some nice adjustments during the game on the pick-and-roll defense, which (the Mavericks) pride themselves on; on our ball pressure and finally defensive rebounding. We didn't let them get a lot of offensive boards." -- Bobcats head coach  Mike Dunlap. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Mavericks held a 23-17 advantage in rebounding in the first half, as they overcame a 13-point deficit in the first quarter to take 55-44 halftime lead. But the Bobcats dominated the boards in the second half and overtime, with their 36-20 edge -- including an 18-2 advantage in offensive rebounds -- helping them fight back from a 15-point deficit. For the game, Charlotte outrebounded Dallas 53-43, including a 21-8 advantage on the offensive glass. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Bobcats closed out the fourth quarter with a 15-7 run to force the game into overtime, holding the Mavericks to just one field goal -- a Carter 3-pointer with 1:35 left -- in seven attempts over the final 4:30. Sessions scored six of his 12 points during the span. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "There were mistakes made and poor decisions at the end, but it was the physical pounding that they put on us in the second half that won the game. They got extra possessions on the boards and they got by us off the dribble. We missed some good shots and made some poor decisions. This team has a lot to learn about winning. This is a very painful lesson." -- Mavericks head coach  Rick Carlisle. 
 
 
 HOT:  Walker -- in addition to his 26 points (17 coming in the first half), the Bobcats' second-year pro also had a career-high eight steals, a season-best six rebounds and seven assists. While his shooting numbers weren't that impressive (10-of-22), he attacked the glass more frequently than in Charlotte's first four games. 
 
 NOT:  Carter was hot in the first three quarters, hitting 4-of-5 3-pointers and 5-of-9 from the field overall to help the Mavericks pull ahead by double digits. But the 14-year pro couldn't hit when it counted -- he was 1-for-6 (1-of-3 on 3-pointers) in the fourth quarter and overtime. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  For those expecting another big game from Bobcats guard  Ben Gordon , his performance against the Mavericks will be a disappointment -- 11 points on 4-of-14 shooting (2-of-4 on 3-pointers) and 1-of-4 from the line in 20 minutes before fouling out in the fourth quarter. That's a stark contrast with his record-setting 34-point game off the bench against the New Orleans Hornets on Friday night, where he went 14-of-21 (3-of-6 on 3s) and 3-of-4 from the line in just under 35 minutes. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Kidd-Gilchrist, taken by the Bobcats with the No. 2 pick in the 2012 NBA Draft, had by far his best game as a pro Saturday against the Mavericks. He went 8-of-12 from the field and 9-of-10 from the free throw line, added a steal and had two of Charlotte's six blocked shots. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The former Mavericks vs. Bobcats losing streak isn't the longest active team-vs.-team streak in the NBA. According to  Rick Bonnell , the Bobcats beat writer for the Charlotte (N.C.) Observer, the longest is the Minnesota Timberwolves' ongoing futility against the L.A. Lakers, now at 19 consecutive losses. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Monday vs. Timberwolves, Wednesday vs. Wizards, Friday @ Pacers. For the Bobcats, Tuesday vs. Wizards, Wednesday @ Timberwolves, Saturday vs. Grizzlies.
