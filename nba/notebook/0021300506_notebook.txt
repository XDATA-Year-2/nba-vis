 THE FACT:  The Nets tied a season-best by winning their third straight, sending the Hawks to their third consecutive loss.  
 
 THE LEAD : Ten days before the teams meet in London, the shorthanded Nets (13-21) overcame a poor second quarter with an impressive third quarter and held off the Hawks (18-17) down the stretch to win 91-86 at Barclays Center.  Joe Johnson  led all scorers with 23, while  Mirza Teletovic  (16 points) provided four big 3-pointers in the victory.  
 
 Jeff Teague  and  Paul Millsap  each finished with 16 for the Hawks, but both were held relatively in check. Teague committed a season-high seven turnovers and the Hawks shot 38.6 percent from the field.   
 
 THE STAT:  The Hawks' 15 third-quarter points were a season-low for a Nets opponent.  
 
 TURNING POINT : The Nets were barely holding on, late in the shot clock with under minute remaining, until Teletovic buried a 3-pointer from the corner off of a skip pass from Johnson. The shot gave the Nets a 89-84 lead.  
 
 INJURY UPDATE: Deron Williams  missed the game with a sprained left ankle.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We feel more comfortable defensively."  --  Nets forward  Andrei Kirilenko 
 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "They went on a big run; we went from up six to down six. I think in a lot of ways that's where the game, you know, was won."  --  Hawks coach  Mike Budenholzer 
 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  In his third career start,  Pero Anti? , the Hawks' 31-year-old Macedonian center, totaled eight points, three rebounds and five fouls.

 NOTABLE:  The Nets are 9-0 when holding opponents under 95 points this season. .... It took  Kyle Korver  three minutes to extend his 3-point streak to 104 games.

The Nets began the third quarter with a 14-0 run. Then the Hawks countered with a 7-0 run. .... Kirilenko logged a season-high 21 minutes...Atlanta has lost a season-high three games in a row and is 6-12 on the road.
