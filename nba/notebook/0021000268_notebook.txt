
 Timberwolves-Mavericks notebook   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Thursday December 2, 2010 7:45AM THE FACTS:   Shawn Marion  scored 16 points and  Tyson Chandler  grabbed 18 rebounds, including a franchise-record 14 in the third quarter, to propel red-hot Dallas to a 100-86 home victory Wednesday against Minnesota. It was the fifth straight loss for the Timberwolves, the seventh straight win for the Mavericks and the 400th career victory for coach  Rick Carlisle  (400-274). QUOTABLE:  "They have a lot of veteran guys. They know how to win. They know how to take away certain things on the offensive end and make you play your weaknesses and not your strengths. That has to do with their coaching and it has to do with the veteran guys." --  Minnesota forward  Kevin Love . THE STAT:  Six different Mavericks drained at least one 3-pointer, with Dallas shooting 41.7 percent (10-for-24) from behind the arc. Marion,  DeShawn Stevenson ,  Jason Terry  and  Brian Cardinal  each sank two and  Jason Kidd  and  J.J. Barea  made one apiece. TURNING POINT:  The Wolves had a chance to trim the deficit to single digits midway through the third quarter, but Stevenson picked off a pass by  Darko Milicic  and lobbed it to Chandler for the two-handed, alley-oop slam. The dunk put the Mavericks on top 67-54 with 6:07 remaining and they never looked back, leading by as many as 24. QUOTABLE II:  "We're never small out there on the floor. Whenever you're small, that allows teams to attack you on the inside. When teams see no true centers out there, they like to attack the basket. Whether it's me or Tyson out there, we're there to provide a presence in the middle and that's a big reason why defensively we're so much better this year." --  Mavericks center  Brendan Haywood , who had seven points and 10 rebounds off the bench. HOT:  Led by Marion, Barea and Terry in double figures, the Mavericks' bench outscored Minnesota's reserves by a 59-32 margin. Dallas improved to 9-2 when its reserves win the scoring battle. Tonight, they also outscored the Mavericks' starters, 59-41. Terry also contributed seven assists and three steals. NOT:  Minnesota had 12 turnovers in the first half, leading to 15 points for Dallas. The Timberwolves finished with 17 turnovers and fell to 1-11 this season when committing 16 or more. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  After becoming the first player in 18 years to notch four 20/20 games in the same calendar month (Atlanta's  Kevin Willis , February 1992), Minnesota forward  Kevin Love  opened December with 12 points and 15 rebounds for his 13th double-double. INSIDE THE ARENA:  To recognize World AIDS Day, players from both teams wore special red-and-white warm-up shirts and many wore red headbands, wristbands and sneakers. Coaches sported red ties and AIDS ribbons on their lapels. ROOKIE WATCH:  The Mavericks' decision Monday to send seldom-used rookie  Dominique Jones  to the NBA D-League quickly produced results. Playing for the Texas Legends, he tallied 25 points on 10-for-14 shooting in a 139-112 win Tuesday vs. Austin. He added five assists, three boards and two steals with just one turnover in 31 minutes in his debut. With Dallas, he averaged 6.2 minutes in nine games. NOTABLE:  The Mavericks have won 16 of the last 17 meetings with the Timberwolves. ... Chandler's 14 third-quarter rebounds broke the Mavericks record for a quarter of 12, shared by  Popeye Jones  (April 6, 1996) and  Lorenzo Williams  (Feb. 21, 1996). ... It was the Mavericks' 300th victory at the American Airlines Center (300-80). UP NEXT:  For the Timberwolves, Friday @ San Antonio, Saturday vs. Cleveland, Monday @ New York. For the Mavericks, Friday @ Utah, Saturday @ Sacramento, Tuesday vs. Golden State.
