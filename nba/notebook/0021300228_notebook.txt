 THE FACT:  After having one of its worst shooting games of the season two days earlier, the Charlotte Bobcats had one of its best games of the 2013-2014 season in beating the Milwaukee Bucks. 
 
 THE LEAD: Al Jefferson  had a season-high 23 points and 12 rebounds, taking over inside in the second half as the Bobcats fought off a Bucks rally for a 92-76 victory Friday night at Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte, N.C. 
 
 Gerald Henderson  added 19 points,  Ramon Sessions  11,  Kemba Walker  10 and  Bismack Biyombo  pulled down a season-best 14 rebounds for Charlotte (8-9), which shot 44.3 percent from the field and snapped a three-game home losing streak. 
 
 Brandon Knight , playing in just his fourth game after missing three weeks because of an injured hamstring, scored 17 points for Milwaukee, which cut a double-digit Bobcats lead to six points twice in the third quarter but could not get closer. 
 
 Gary Neal  and  Ekpe Udoh  added 10 points each for the Bucks (2-13), who lost their 11th consecutive game and sixth straight on the road. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Every game, I'm getting better and better with the way I feel and the way I'm playing. Milwaukee is a heck of a team, they've got great shooters and they were hanging around in the fourth (quarter). I did want to take it upon myself to go on and seal the game and walk away with the win, and I got hot."  --  Jefferson . 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Jefferson, playing in just his fifth straight game and eighth this season, was held to four points and no rebounds in the first half. But the 6-foot-10 center shot 9-of-15 from the field in the second half, as well as pulled down all 12 of his boards, as the Bobcats led by as many as 19 points. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Bucks twice cut double-digit Charlotte leads down to manageable levels, the last at 56-50 with 7:04 left in the third quarter. But Walker nailed a 3-pointer and Jefferson scored six points during a 13-3 run that pushed the Bobcats lead back to 69-53 with three minutes remaining. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "He's a good player. He's a solid low-post scorer, and when you put the ball in his hands down low he can made a lot of things happen. He did seem to take over in that second half. We gave him different looks, but he still scored."  --  Bucks coach  Larry Drew  on Jefferson. 
 
 
 HOT:  Biyombo pulled down 10 rebounds in the second quarter alone, dominating inside for the Bobcats after Jefferson sat most of the first half because of foul problems. In addition to his 14 rebounds, Biyombo also scored seven points and had a blocked shot. 
 
 NOT: O.J. Mayo , the Bucks' leading scorer at 15.3 points per game, finished with just five points Friday on 2-of-11 shooting, including a 1-of-6 effort on 3-pointers. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  With the Bucks still threatening and moving to a smaller lineup, the Bobcats got the ball inside to Jefferson in the fourth quarter. The result? He scored 13 points and grabbed seven rebounds in the period, helping Charlotte increase its lead from 11 points to as many as 19. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Bobcats forward  Cody Zeller  scored seven points -- including a pair of dunks -- and pulled down four rebounds in 19 minutes. For the Bucks,  Nate Wolters  was the only rookie who saw any playing time, scoring six points and adding a pair of assists and a steal in 19 minutes. 
 
 NOTABLE : The Bucks' 11-game losing streak is the team's longest since their franchise-record 15-game slide during the 1995-1996 season. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Bucks, Saturday vs. Celtics, Tuesday @ Celtics, Wednesday vs. Pistons. For the Bobcats, Sunday @ Heat, Tuesday @ Mavericks, Friday vs. 76ers.
