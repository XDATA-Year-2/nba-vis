  Spurs-Mavs notebook   By Darrin Scheid, for NBA.com Posted Friday December 31, 2010 12:59AM THE FACTS : Rookie  Gary Neal  scored 21 points and  Tim Duncan  had 17 points and 11 rebounds as the San Antonio Spurs defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 99-93, at the American Airlines Center. The Spurs are off to the second-best start in NBA history through 32 games. Neal and fellow guard  Manu Ginobili  combined to hit nine 3-pointers, and the Spurs dominated the boards against a Mavericks team playing without injured forward  Dirk Nowitzki . The Spurs out-rebounded Dallas, 50-35. Dallas forward  Caron Butler  had 30 points, and Mavericks point guard Jason Kidd had a triple-double with 12 points, 10 rebounds and 13 assists. QUOTABLE:  "Any win is a good win, and on the road, they're even sweeter. We were fortunate in a lot of ways. I don't think we were sharp, and I thought Dallas showed a lot of character."    --San Antonio head coach  Gregg Popovich. THE STAT:  The Mavericks were 13-for-15 from the foul line, and both misses failed to tie the game and complete a Dallas comeback after trailing by as many as 16 early in the second quarter. Mavericks guard DeShawn Stevenson missed the second of two free throws with Dallas trailing, 57-56, with 7:59 left in the third. Less than five minutes later, Dallas center Tyson Chandler couldn't complete a three-point play that would have tied it, 63-63. TURNING POINT:  The Spurs closed the third quarter with an 8-2 run over the final two minutes to turn a one-point advantage to 71-64. In that span, Dallas missed five shots. San Antonio stretched its advantage to 78-68 early in the fourth on a 3-pointer by guard Manu Ginobili. HOT:  San Antonio's bench combined to go 15-for-27 from the field and 6-for-7 from the line for 42 points. NOT:  Mavericks guard  Jason Terry , the team's second-leading scorer at 15.8 points per game, was 3-for-16 from the field for eight points. He was 1-for-10 heading into the fourth quarter. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Mavericks forward  Caron Butler  was 10-for-21 from the field and perfect in nine free-throw attempts for a season-high 30 points. Butler's season average was 14.9. GOOD MOVE : Dallas guard Jason Terry missed a 15-foot jumper late in the third quarter but tracked down the rebound. He dribbled right, back through the lane and around traffic, then cut toward the foul line and lofted an alley-oop pass to Tyson Chandler for the basket. ROOKIE WATCH:  Spurs rookie Gary Neal, a 26-year-old guard who played in Europe before signing with San Antonio, was 6-for-10 from the field, 5-for-8 from the 3-point line for 21 points. It's the third game this season in which Neal hit five from beyond the arc. He entered the game on a hot streak, averaging 14.8 points per game in San Antonio's previous six games. NOTABLE:  The triple-double by  Jason Kidd  was his first this season and 106th of his career. Kidd also had two blocks, one coming on a breakaway layup attempt by Spurs guard Tony Parker...San Antonio snapped a four-game regular-season losing streak against Dallas...Tim Duncan's double-double was the 12th this season. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Saturday @ Bucks, Sunday @ Cavaliers, Tuesday vs. Portland, For the Spurs, Saturday vs. Thunder, Tuesday @ Knicks, Wednesday @ Celtics.
