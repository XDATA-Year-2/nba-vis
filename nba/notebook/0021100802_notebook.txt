  Notebook: Hawks 120, Bobcats 93 Posted Wednesday April 4, 2012 11:59PM By Jon Cooper, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  The Atlanta Hawks had three days off to stew over their recent stretch of three losses in four games. They took out their frustration on a tired and depleted Charlotte Bobcats team Wednesday night at Philips Arena, routing the visitors, 120-93. Josh Smith  put in a game-high 24 points for the Hawks, who had six players score at least a dozen, and shot a 56.6 percent, while handing out 32 assists, both tied the team's single-game high. Kemba Walker  led the Bobcats, who were playing the second night of a back-to-back, with 21 points and five assists. Walker played the entire second half in place of starting point  D.J. Augustin , who left the game at halftime with tendonitis in his right knee. Atlanta led 27-25 after one, but broke the game open in the second quarter, when they outscored the Bobcats, 34-19. Smith scored seven straight points to blow open what was a single-digit game. The 34 points matched the Hawks' season high for most productive second quarter, and their 73.7 percent in the frame also was a season best. A 20-10 run over the final 5:51 gave the Hawks a 61-44 halftime edge. The lead never got below 17 in the second half, topping out at 32 with 4:40 to go in the game. The teams meet again on Saturday night in Charlotte. It'll be the second of a back-to-back for both clubs and the fourth in five nights for the 'Cats. QUOTABLE:  "You have to look at what you have, but losing is still tough. The injuries, the young kids, it's difficult. I've never lost like this in my life."   -- Bobcats Head Coach  Paul Silas THE STAT:  60 -- Atlanta's season-high number of points in the paint scored Wednesday night. The previous high was 58, scored March 25 against Utah. They needed four overtimes to reach that total. THE STAT II:  47 -- The number of field goals they made Wednesday. The total was one off the season-high, also done in against Utah. Atlanta attempted 83 shots to get the 47 field goals Wednesday. They needed 107 tries to get 48 against the Jazz. TURNING POINT:  Starting the second quarter, Atlanta, leading 27-25, completed the switch out to its second unit by bringing in point guard  Jannero Pargo , to join  Marvin Williams ,  Ivan Johnson ,  Willie Green  and  Tracy McGrady . The unit responded, jumping going on a quarter-opening 6-0 run in the first two minutes and extending the lead to nine by the 4:35 mark. In that time the unit shot 4-for-6, and 4-for-4 from the line, while forcing Charlotte into 1-for-5 shooting, and forcing turnovers on three straight possessions. The starters returned and quickly got the lead into double digits, where it remained the rest of the game. QUOTABLE II:  "After the first quarter I thought we really turned up our intensity, we turned up our energy. But it started with our bench. I thought the minute we went to the bench, particularly in the second quarter, we started creating some separation."   -- Hawks Head Coach  Larry Drew HOT:  After shooting 1-for-7 (14.3 percent) from three in the first half, Atlanta hit 8-of-12 (66.7 percent) behind the arc in the final 24 minutes, including nailing 5-of-7 tries (71.4 percent) in the fourth.  Willie Green  (3-for-4) and  Jannero Pargo  (2-for-3) combined to hit all five threes in the final stanza. HOT:   Kemba Walker  did his best to keep Charlotte in the game in the second quarter. The rookie scored 11 points on 4-of-6 shooting and was 2-for-2 on three-point attempts. NOT:  While Walker was doing his thing in the second quarter, the rest of the Bobcats struggled. The rest of the team managed eight points on 2-for-11 shooting and were 0-for-4 from behind the arc. ROOKIE WATCH:  Walker ran the point the entire second half, when Augustin was forced to leave the game. He played a game-high 32:59 and led the Bobcats in scoring. He shot 8-for-15, 3-for-4 from three, 2-for-3 from the line, handed out five assists and pulled down four rebounds. The 21 points were two off his career high, set Jan. 14 against Golden State. NOTABLE:   Josh Smith  continued to torment Charlotte, putting in 24, while grabbing nine boards. In three games against the Bobcats Smith is averaging 25.7 points and 11.7 rebounds. ...Atlanta's 61 points were two shy of its best half of the year (63 vs. Chicago on Jan. 7). ...Atlanta, which came in shooting 73.1 percent from the line and Charlotte converting at 75.2 percent, combined to make 84.6 percent of their free throws. The Hawks were 17-for-19 (89.5 percent, tied for their second-best game of the year), while the Bobcats hit 16-of-20 (80.0 percent). ...Both teams donned tee shirts on behalf of the "NBA Cares, Three for Trees" program instead of warmups. UP NEXT:  For the Bobcats, Friday @ Milwaukee, Saturday vs. Atlanta, Monday vs. Washington. For the Hawks, Friday vs. Detroit, Saturday @ Charlotte, Wednesday @ Boston.
