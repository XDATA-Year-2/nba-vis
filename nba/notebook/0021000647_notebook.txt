  Knicks-Thunder notebook   By Randy Renner, NBA.com Posted Saturday January 22, 2011 11:28PM THE FACTS:  Oklahoma City's  Kevin Durant  hit an off-balance, fallaway 3-pointer at the buzzer to give the Thunder a thrilling 101-98 come-from-behind win over the New York Knicks. Durant was the game's leading scorer with 30 points. He also pulled down 12 rebounds, including the one that gave his team possession for the last shot. Thunder point guard  Russell Westbrook  added 28.  Danillo Gallinari  led the Knicks with 23 points.  Amar'e Stoudemire  added 18. It was New York's seventh straight loss. QUOTABLE:  "Every win is a good win but the first half was an embarrassing performance. They got anything they wanted. The second half was much better we came out with intensity and some fight."   --Thunder coach  Scott Brooks THE STAT:  In the first half New York scored 60 points on 23-for-42 shooting (54.8 percent). In the second half the Knicks managed just 38 points on 14-for-44 shooting (31.8 percent). TURNING POINT:  New York point guard  Raymond Felton  missed an open jumper in the lane with :06.5 left. Durant grabbed the rebound to give his team the chance to go for the win. QUOTABLE II:  "We got just enough stops to win, and then obviously KD hit a really big shot for us."   --Thunder center  Nick Collison HOT:  In the first half Gallinari scored 18 points on 6-for-7 shooting, including 2-for-2 on 3-pointers. NOT:  In the second half he was only able to score five points on 1-for-5 shooting. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Westbrook finished with 28 points on 7-for-15 shooting. He also grabbed five rebounds, dished out five assists, stole the ball twice and blocked a shot. He was also 14-for-17 at the free-throw line. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Thunder mascot Rumble The Bison celebrated his birthday with eight other NBA team mascots on hand. ROOKIE WATCH:  Knicks guard  Landry Fields  played 30:51 and scored 11 points on 4-for-7 shooting. He also grabbed two rebounds, stole the ball twice and handed out an assist. NOTABLE:  Oklahoma City is now 14-2 when Durant scores at least 30 points. Westbrook has scored at least 20 points in six straight games. Stoudemire had scored at least 20 points in 26 consecutive games going into Friday's contest in San Antonio. He has now missed that mark in two straight games.
