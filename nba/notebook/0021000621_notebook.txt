  Lakers-Mavericks notebook   By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com Posted Thursday January 20, 2011 12:20AM THE FACTS:  The stumbling Mavericks and their struggling veteran point guard rose to the challenge Wednesday night against the visiting Lakers, snapping a six-game losing skid as  Jason Kidd  registered a season-high 21 points and 10 assists in a 109-100 victory.  Jason Terry  and  Shawn Marion  each scored 22 off the bench for Dallas, which avoided its first seven-game slide since 1999. Los Angeles, which has lost two of its last three, got a game-high 23 points from  Pau Gasol , 21 points and 10 assists from  Kobe Bryant  and 20 points and 10 rebounds from  Lamar Odom . QUOTABLE:  "The big thing was realizing and assessing the situation and then attacking from the beginning. Tonight we came into this game with all 12 guys suited up and ready to play. Guys got after it on both ends of the floor and played hard, and it just happened to be against the world champions."   -- Jason Terry THE STAT:  The Mavericks improved to 18-1 this season when scoring 100 or more points. Dallas shot a season-high 55.0 percent from the field and fell two points shy of matching its season high of 111 set at Oklahoma City on Nov. 24. TURNING POINT:  After a 3-poiner by  Ron Artest  put L.A. ahead 69-65 midway through the third quarter, the Mavericks put together a 17-2 run that was capped by back-to-back 3-pointers from Kidd and  Sasha Pavlovic . Kidd (six), Marion (six) and Pavlocic (five) accounted for all of the Dallas points during that surge. QUOTABLE II:  "To keep playing this hard and together like this, we can beat anybody in the league. I just wanted to come out and play hard with these guys. I just prepare myself to do the best that I can do."   -- Sasha Pavlovic HOT:  Following a frigid 2-for-16 effort from 3-point territory in his previous three games, including an 0-for-7 goose egg Monday at Detroit, Kidd was money against the Lakers. He was 5-for-8 from behind the arc and 8-for-12 overall. He made all five of his shots (three triples) and scored 13 during the decisive third period. NOT:  The Lakers established season lows for free throws made (six) and attempted (seven). INSIDE THE ARENA:  Dallas Cowboys great  Emmitt Smith , the NFL's all-time rushing leader, was sitting courtside. Fellow Hall of Famer  Tony Dorsett , the No. 2 rusher in Cowboys history behind Smith, also attended. If that wasn't enough for Cowboys fans, quarterback  Tony Romo  was also among the 20,365 in the house, the 381st straight sellout at American Airlines Center. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  After missing two games with the flu, center  Tyson Chandler  was back in action for the Mavericks with 10 rebounds (six on the offensive glass), six points, two assists, two steals and two blocked shots. GOOD MOVE:  Playing on the last night of his 10-day contract, Pavlovic got the start for Dallas and contributed 11 points on 5-for-7 shooting. He had scored a total of nine points in four previous games since signing on Jan. 10. Pavlovic, who was wearing a protective mask after breaking his nose earlier this week, played 24:17 and added three rebounds and one assist. BAD MOVE:  Playing their third game in four nights, the Lakers looked a step slow all night defending the perimeter. After missing their first seven shots from 3-point distance, the Mavericks knocked down seven of their next eight and finished 12-for-26 (46.2 percent). NOTABLE:  Gasol reached the 13,000-point milestone with a hook shot with 1:00 remaining in the first half. He scored 17 of his 23 before intermission. ... Dallas has not lost more than six consecutive games since owner  Mark Cuban  purchased the team in January 2000. The Mavericks' last seven-game slide was from Feb. 9-19, 1999. ... The Mavericks improved to 27-14, identical to their record after 41 games last season. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Thursday @ Chicago, Saturday @ New Jersey, Tuesday vs. Los Angeles Clippers. For the Lakers, Friday @ Denver, Tuesday vs. Utah, Jan. 28 vs. Sacramento.
