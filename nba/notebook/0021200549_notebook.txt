 THE FACTS:   Carmelo Anthony  scored a game-high 27 points and added seven rebounds as the Knicks snapped a three-game losing streak with an 100-87 victory over the New Orleans Hornets at Madison Square Garden. Anthony had his 24th straight 20-plus points game for New York (24-13). Knicks rookie  Chris Copeland  started and added 22 points, including 4-of-8 from beyond the arc. 
 
 Eric Gordon  led New Orleans with 22 points and No. 1 draft pick  Anthony Davis  had 13 points and eight rebounds in his pro debut at the Garden. The Hornets (11-26) saw their four-game winning streak come to an end. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Its huge but we were very confident coming into this game that we were going to get this win...We were locked in early." 
  -- Copeland on MSG 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Hornets, who entered today seventh in the league in 3-point percentage (37.5), shot 1-for-13 from beyond the arc in the first half and 4-of-23 overall. The Knicks went 11-of-30 from deep 
 
 TURNING POINT:  After trailing for the 11th time in 12 games after the first quarter (29-22), the Knicks turned the tide in the second. In the period, Anthony scored 18 points on 6-of-9 shooting and 5-of-6 from the line as the Knicks outscored the Hornets, 27-12, to seize a 49-41 halftime lead. He had 20 points and six rebounds at the break. The Knicks then helped put the game away with an 11-0 fourth-quarter run -- highlighted by back-to-back 3-pointers from Copeland and  Steve Novak  -- to turn a 73-68 lead into an 84-68 advantage. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I thought Cope was great. You give him an opportunity to start again and he stepped up and made plays offensively and rebounded a few. I'm very pleased with Cope." 
  --  Mike Woodson 
 
 
 WHO'S HOT:  Copeland made the most of his starter's minutes, scoring 20-plus points for the third time this season. He finished 9-of-15 from the field and scored seven key fourth-quarter points. 
 
 WHO'S NOT:  Hornets guard  Austin Rivers  went scoreless for the fourth straight game. The former Duke star will face his father, Boston Celtics coach  Doc Rivers  on Wednesday. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Knicks guard  Iman Shumpert  has been cleared to play after missing the entire season so far while recovering from an ACL injury. He could play Thursday against the Detroit Pistons in London. "He's been cleared," Woodson said Saturday. "He'll practice on Monday and if we get the two practices in, for sure one in London, and there's no setback, he will be cleared, probably, to play in the Detroit game." He added: "Just to have him back in uniform will be nice." 
 
 NOTABLE II:  Amar'e Stoudemire  had 12 points and three rebounds in 23 minutes. Woodson said before the game that Stoudemire had been cleared to up his minutes to between 25-30. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "Each game, Amar'e is going to get better because his minutes are going to grow...Now he's got a little break where. When we hit Detroit, he should be right at his 30 minutes that night." 
 -- Woodson 
 
 
 NOTABLE III:  Anthony has been fasting for 15 days and says he has struggled to find energy during that time. "I usually do it to get some clarity in my life and spiritual reasons," Anthony said after going for 27 points and seven boards as the Knicks snapped a three-game losing streak with a 100-87 win over the New Orleans Hornets. "But I'm done now." The fast might explain Anthony's slow starts recently. In his last two games, he's 2-for-16 with six combined points in two first quarters against Chicago and New Orleans. Of course, he finished with 39 and 27 points, respectively. 
 
 QUOTABLE IV:  "My teammates, they out there looking out for me on the floor and they telling me to be aggressive." 
  -- Copeland 
 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA: Bernard King  and  Hank Azaria  sat courtside. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Knicks, Thursday vs. Detroit (London), Monday vs. Brooklyn, Jan. 24 @ Boston. For the Hornets, Tuesday @ Philadelphia, Wednesday @ Boston, Saturday vs. Golden State.
