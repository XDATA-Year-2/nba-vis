  Notebook: Suns 96, Mavericks 94 Posted Friday March 9, 2012 2:08AM By Mike Tulumello, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  The Dallas Mavericks don't look like world champs these days. The Mavericks got a chance for comfort Thursday night from a familiar source, rolling up a 12-point lead over the Phoenix Suns -- a team they'd beaten eight straight -- but they couldn't hold it. The Suns roared back, then held on in the closing seconds for a 96-94 home win. That sent the Mavericks to their seventh loss in the past 10 games. The Suns (18-21) won their sixth in the past eight. They also have won four straight at home, overcoming double-digit deficits in all of them. They got 18 points and eight rebounds from  Jared Dudley  plus 16 points and 12 boards from  Marcin Gortat . For the Mavericks,  Dirk Nowitzki  shot 8-for-15 for 18 points and  Vince Carter  shot 8-for-21, also for 18. The Mavericks ran up a 55-44 halftime lead and increased it to 72-60 on a Lamar Odom 3-pointer with 4:43 left in the third quarter. Then the Suns, with  Hakim Warrick  joining the starters, sprinted off on an 18-4 run to close the quarter and take a 78-76 lead. The Suns led 83-80 early in the final quarter when Warrick hit a pair of free throws,  Sebastian Telfair  nailed a 3-pointer and then  Shannon Brown  scored on a spectacular follow-slam to make it 90-80 with 7:30 left. But with the Suns leading 96-94 in the closing seconds,  Grant Hill  missed two free throws. He'd also missed a shot that would have virtually wrapped it up, an uncontested layup with 4:13 left and the Suns leading 93-84. The Mavericks'  Rodrique Beaubois  missed a runner in the lane with 5.6 seconds left, but the ball was knocked out of bounds back to the Mavericks. Beaubois missed an open 16-footer, and the Mavericks were done. The Mavericks played the first of three straight; they visit the Sacramento Kings Friday night and Golden State Saturday night. QUOTABLE:  "This is definitely big for us. We've probably struggled against that team more than any other. They have a lot of guys who can make plays, are smart, and they know the game."    -- Jared Dudley on beating the Mavericks. THE STAT:  The Mavericks shot just 35 percent in the second half. TURNING POINT:  The Suns' 18-4 run at the end of the third quarter, which gave them a 78-76 lead heading into the final quarter. This was the Suns' first lead since the first quarter. QUOTABLE II:  "I gotta go with guys who perform. If he's going to be out there, he's got to perform."   -- Suns coach  Alvin Gentry  on the slumping  Markief Morris . FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:   Channing Frye  continued his slide. He shot 2-for-8, making him 12-for-47 over the past four games. GOOD MOVE:  Gentry replaced Frye in the second half with the energetic Warrick instead of the sleepy Morris. The game turned in the Suns' favor immediately. BAD MOVE:  That Gentry used Morris at all. Morris failed to score or grab a rebound in six minutes, though he did commit a 3-shot foul. Over the past six games, he's averaged 2.0 points on 4-for-26 shooting. NOTABLE:  Carter moved past  Bob Pettit  (20,880 points) for No. 32 all time. Pettit was the first NBA player to eclipse 20,000 points. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Friday @ Sacramento, Saturday @ Golden State and Tuesday vs. Washington. For the Suns, Saturday vs. Memphis, Monday vs. Minnesota and Wednesday vs. Utah.
