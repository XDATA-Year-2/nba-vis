 THE FACTS:   Brandon Knight  had 18 points and  Greg Monroe  contributed 16 points and six rebounds as the Detroit Pistons notched a 105-90 victory over the Orlando Magic at The Palace of Auburn Hills on Tuesday. The Pistons (16-25) have won nine of their last 13 while the Magic (14-27) has dropped 14 of its last 16, including the last three.  Will Bynum  had 15 point and  Rodney Stuckey  added 14 for Detroit, which tied a season-low with eight turnovers.  J.J. Redick  led Orlando with 26 points and  Jameer Nelson  added 14. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "At the start of the third quarter, we set the tone down low first. Greg got rolling and we passed it out and got open shots. Then ( Andre Drummond ) came in and set the tone with the 'D', set good screens and rolled to the rim hard and got easy baskets." 
 -- Pistons forward  Jason Maxiell  on the play of Monroe and rookie Drummond. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  50. The Pistons have increasingly become a power team with strong rebounding from Monroe, Drummond and Maxiell. Detroit had a 54-41 rebounding advantage over the Magic, the seventh time in 13 games it has reached the 50-rebound mark. Maxiell and Drummond each had 11 while Monroe grabbed six despite sitting out the fourth quarter. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Up just two early in the third, the Pistons outscored Orlando 24-10 the rest of the quarter to take an 82-66 lead. Monroe and Drummond were the catalysts. Monroe had a stretch of eight consecutive points and Drummond scored the last six points of the quarter on a layup and two dunks. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "That's part of the identity of our team. There's not a lot of games where guys are scoring 20 or 30. Individually, we get a wide variety of points from different players." 
 -- Pistons guard  Kyle Singler  on Detroit's balanced scoring. It had six players in double figures for the second straight game without any reaching 20 points. 
 
 
 HOT:  Monroe has been a model of consistency this month. He was averaging 16.9 points and 11 rebounds in January and overcame a slow start Tuesday with his strong third quarter performance. He also played solid defense on the Magic's  Nikola Vucevic , who was averaging 14.4 points and 13.3 rebounds. Vucevic had 10 points and nine rebounds.  
 
 NOT:  Orlando forward  Glen Davis  was outplayed by Maxiell, shooting 4-for-16 from the field while scoring 11 points in 23 minutes. He was also limited to three rebounds and picked up a third-quarter technical. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Drummond came into the game tied for sixth place on the league's dunk list with  Kevin Durant  and  Andre Iguodala  and added two more for 66 on the season. Singler had six points and seven rebounds.  Andrew Nicholson  had six points in 11 minutes off the bench for Orlando but committed four fouls. Magic forward  Maurice Harkless  had four points in 14 minutes. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Orlando's leading scorer entering the game,  Aaron Afflalo , was held scoreless against his former team on 38 minutes. He attempted just four shots. ... Magic reserve center  Gustavo Ayon  was active after missing the last eight games with a right thigh contusion. He had eight points in 10 minutes. ... Detroit's reserves outscored Orlando's bench 48-29. ... Maxiell had his fourth double-double with 11 points and 11 rebounds. .... The Pistons, ranked last in attendance earlier this season, have moved past New Orleans and Sacramento on that list. They were averaging 13,949 fans entering Tuesday's game. They drew 11,798 on a night when the temperature only reached single digits. ...  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Magic, Thursday vs. Toronto, Sunday vs. Detroit, Monday @ Brooklyn. For the Pistons, Wednesday @ Chicago, Friday @ Miami, Sunday @ Orlando.
