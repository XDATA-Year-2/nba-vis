 THE FACT:  The Thunder extend their overall winning streak to five straight and their home court winning streak to 11 consecutive games with their win over the Lakers. 
 
 THE LEAD:   Kevin Durant  scored 31 points and  Russell Westbrook  and  Serge Ibaka  had double-doubles in the first three quarters then watched from the bench as the Oklahoma City Thunder led by as many as 30 points and crushed the outmanned Los Angeles Lakers 122-97. 
 L.A. played without three of their rotation players and didn't have a healthy point guard on the roster.  Kobe Bryant  played the point and embraced the role dishing 13 assists, but he scored only four points on 2-for-6 shooting. 
 The Thunder trio dominated from the opening tip. Durant's 31 points came on just 13 shots. He was 10-for-13 (3-for-5 on threes) and 8-for-8 at the stripe. Westbrook just missed a triple-double for the fourth straight game and had he played in the fourth quarter he might have gotten it. He finished with 19 points, 12 assists and eight boards. Ibaka also had 19 points and he pulled down 10 rebounds.  Reggie Jackson  came off the bench to also put up 19 points. 
 Los Angeles had four players in double figures led by 17 from  Nick Young  and 15 from Oklahoma City native  Xavier Henry . They both came off the bench.  Pau Gasol  led the Lakers starters with 14 points and  Wesley Johnson  added 13. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We moved the ball very well, a season high in assists and we defended at a high level. Our passing and our defending was just outstanding. We're off to a good start but it's just a good start. We still have a lot of things to work on. But I like where we are right now." 
 --Thunder head coach  Scott Brooks 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Thunder had 34 assists and outrebounded the Lakers 59-41. OKC held Los Angeles to 41.4 percent shooting overall and 28 percent (7-for-25) on threes. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Lakers cut a 15 point OKC lead early in the second quarter all the way down to six with about eight minutes to play before halftime. The Thunder then went on a 12-0 run to extend their lead out to 18. LA never could reel the Thunder back in after that run. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "T hey're a tough team, they were very aggressive and we did a poor job on Westbrook." 
 
 -- Gasol 
 
 
 HOT:  The Thunder started the game shooting 69.2 percent (9-for-13). ... Durant was 7-for-9 (22 points) in the first half...Ibaka was 5-for-7 (10 points) in the half. ... Gasol was 6-for-9 (12 points) at halftime. ... The Thunder bench scored 45 points and grabbed 26 rebounds. 
 
 NOT:  The Lakers were 4-for-14 (28.6 percent) on 3-pointers at halftime. ... J odie Meeks  was 3-for-12 (nine points) at the end of the 3rd quarter. ... He was 1-for-8 in the second half. ... Jackson was 3-for-10 in the second half. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The 124th consecutive sellout inside Chesapeake Energy Arena. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Early in the game rookie Thunder guard  Andre Roberson , filling in for the injured  Thabo Sefolosha , drew the defensive assignment on Bryant. On LA's second possession Roberson got up into Bryant's face and forced a jump ball. OKC won the tip and Westbrook hit a three for the first points of the game. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Lakers turned it over on two consecutive possessions in the third quarter -- first when Gasol fell down and the ball bounced away and over to Ibaka. He passed to Westbrook who hit a layup. Then on LA's next possession Durant swatted the ball away from  Young as he was holding it up over his head. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Thunder rookie center  Steven Adams  played 15 minutes, scoring one point and pulling down five rebounds. 
 
 NOTABLE:  This is the just the sixth time in Bryant's career he's started a game and scored four points or less. ... The 38 points scored by the Thunder in the first quarter was a season high in the first 12 minutes of a game. And the 66 they had at halftime is the most in any half this season, and the 122 they finished with was also a season high. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Lakers: Saturday @ Charlotte, Monday @ Atlanta, Tuesday @ Memphis. For the Thunder: Sunday vs. Orlando, Tuesday @ Denver, Thursday vs. Chicago.
