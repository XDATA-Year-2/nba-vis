 THE FACT:  The Golden State Warriors ended their two-game losing streak and improved to 10-8 on the season with a tough 115-113 win over the Sacramento Kings. 
 
 THE LEAD : In a wild afternoon duel, the Golden State Warriors beat the Sacramento Kings by a final of 115-113 on a pair of  Stephen Curry  free throws with under 10 seconds remaining. 
 Curry was unstoppable, scoring a game-high 36 points and 10 assists in 40 minutes of action.  Despite playing with four fouls much of the second half,  Klay Thompson  scorched Sacramento for 28 points on 10-for-19 shooting.   David Lee  kicked in 11 points and  Andrew Bogut  grabbed 12 rebounds to help the Warriors improve to 10-8 on the season. 
 
 DeMarcus Cousins  led the way for Sacramento with 24 points and six rebounds in 21 foul plagued minutes.  Marcus Thornton  added 21 points, while  Isaiah Thomas  scored 19 points and handed out eight assists in the loss.  
 
 THE STAT:  The Warriors starting backcourt of Curry and Thompson outscored the Kings starting backcourt of  Greivis Vasquez  and  Ben McLemore  by the final of 64-10.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I've got a great backcourt.  Two guys that can light up the scoreboard.  The thing I love the most about them - people fall in love with the shooting, which is obvious, but they compete."  --  Warriors coach  Mark Jackson. 
 
 
 TURNING POINT:  This game was a barn-burner down the stretch. Curry hit the game-deciding free throws with under 10 seconds to go and Thomas was blocked by Bogut in his last second attempt to tie the game. 
 
 HOT:  Thompson caught fire from long-range and the Kings had no answer. The third-year guard out of Washington State went 8-for-11 from deep and finished with 28 points on the night. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I got a lot of open looks and my teammates found me.  I let it fly.  That's how I have to play, just let it fly and not think about it."  --  Thompson . 
 
 
 HOT II: Patrick Patterson  hit all eight of his field goal attempts on his way to an 18-point, seven rebound night .  
 
 NOT:  The Kings came into the game leading the league in fewest turnovers per game at 13.  They turned the ball over 16 times in the first half of today's game and 24 times overall. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Warriors kept shooting and making 3-pointers all game long.  They finished 15-for-25 as a team behind the arc.  
 
 BAD MOVE : Sacramento knew coming in that the Warriors were the best 3-point shooting team in the league, yet they allowed the Warriors to get countless open looks from downtown all game long.  
 
 NOTABLE I : Thompson set a new career-high with eight made 3-pointers....Thornton surpassed  Doug Christie  (316) to move into eighth place on the Sacramento-era career 3-pointers made list.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Warriors, Tuesday vs. Raptors, Friday @ Houston, Saturday @ Memphis. For the Kings, Tuesday vs. Thunder, Friday vs. Lakers, Saturday @ Utah.
