 THE FACTS: After a tightly contested first half, the Philadelphia 76ers got enough separation from the Sacramento Kings to take a 117-103 win on Sunday night. 
 
 Jrue Holiday  barely missed a triple-double, finishing with 21 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists for the Sixers (27-42).  Dorell Wright  added 22 points while  Lavoy Allen  had 20 off the Philly bench.  Spencer Hawes  scored 14 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in 31 minutes. 
 
 Tyreke Evans  fought off stomach issues to score 19 points and hand out eight assists for Sacramento (25-46).   Isaiah Thomas  dropped in 25 points, but failed to register an assist in 29 minutes.  Marcus Thornton  added 22 points off the Kings bench in the loss.  
 
 QUOTABLE : "It finally feels good to win on the road.  I'm so happy for our guys, especially the way they bounced back after that tough tough loss in Denver.  It shows a lot about our guys at this stage of the season to come out and fight."   
 -- Sixers coach  Doug Collins 
 
 
 THE STAT : The 76ers outrebounded the Kings 48-37 on the night.  As Sacramento began to run out of gas, Philadelphia beat them to every loose ball, finishing with 17 offensive rebounds to just nine for the Kings.  
 
 TURNING POINT : The Kings came out flat in the third quarter and the 76ers torched them.  After playing a road game in Denver last night, it looked like the Kings just ran out of gas in the second half as Philly outscored the home team 59-44 after the break. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "The amount of support they've given this team for the last 28-years has been incredible. And whether they're winning or they're losing, they come out every night and they support the team.  Other than the ones that booed me, I can't say anything bad about them."   
 -- Seattle native and Kings draft pick Spencer Hawes on the Sacramento crowd that booed him 
 
 HOT : The Kings bench came in firing in the second quarter, combining for 25 points on 10-for-14 shooting. Thornton led the way with 12 points in 12 minutes, while  Patrick Patterson  added 10 points and grabbed three rebounds before the intermission. 
 
 NOT :  DeMarcus Cousins  couldn't stay on the floor, playing just 27 minutes due to foul trouble.  When he was in the game, he struggled, scoring just eight points on 3-for-9 shooting.  
 
 GOOD MOVE : Collins had his Sixers team push the tempo against the road-weary Kings and it worked to perfection.  Sacramento had no legs down the stretch and Philly took advantage.  
 
 NOTABLE : Allen registered a new career-high with 20 points on 9-for-13 shooting.  His previous high was 15, which he scored against the Bulls on Feb. 1, 2012.  ... The 76ers set a new season-high with 117 points scored and tied their season-high in assists with 31. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the 76ers, Monday @ Utah, Wednesday vs. Bucks, Friday @ Cleveland. For the Kings, Wednesday @ Golden State, Thursday @ Phoenix, Saturday vs. Lakers.
