  Blazers-Nuggets notebook   By Kerry Eggers, for NBA.com Posted Friday November 19, 2010 2:14AM THE FACTS:  The Trail Blazers won 86-83 with defense and rebounding on a night when they shot only 40 percent from the field and 50 percent from the free-throw line QUOTABLE:  "A very ugly win. We didn't shoot the ball particularly well, but we got on the offensive boards, get a lot of putbacks and kept ourselves alive until we were able to hit some shots in the second half."   -- Blazers'  Marcus Camby . THE STAT:  Portland outrebounded Denver 48-35 and won the points-in-the-paint battle 40-16. TURNING POINT:   Rudy Fernandez  hit a pair of 3-pointers early in the fourth quarter to spark a 10-3 Blazer run and produce a five-point lead. The Nuggets played from behind the rest of the way. QUOTABLE II:  "He was like  Pau Gasol , tipping balls in."   -- Nuggets coach  George Karl  on  LaMarcus Aldridge , who had seven offensive rebounds to help him to a 24-point, 10-rebound night. HOT:   Wesley Matthews  sank three straight 3-pointers in the third quarter as Portland went on a 17-5 run to turn a 55-45 deficit into a 62-60 lead. NOT:   Marcus Camby  was 2-for-10 from the field. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Matthews had his first 20 point/10 rebound game as a Blazer, getting exactly that in 40 minutes. Matthews had 15 points and eight boards in the game's first 18 minutes. INSIDE THE ARENA:  It was the 120th straight sellout for the Blazers at the Rose Garden. GOOD MOVE:   Nate McMillan  used Matthews to defend  Carmelo Anthony . Anthony scored 18 points -- six below his average -- before fouling out with 3:08 remaining. BAD MOVE:  Anthony drew offensive fouls on his last two fouls -- one setting a screen, the other on a drive to the basket. NOTABLE:  The Blazer players are wearing a "20" patch on their jerseys for the rest of the season in honor of  Maurice Lucas , the former Portland player and assistant coach who recently died of cancer. UP NEXT:  For the Blazers, Utah Saturday, New Orleans next Friday. For the Nuggets, New Jersey Saturday, Golden State Monday.
