 THE FACT:  After starting their west coast road trip 0-4, the Pelicans ended their losing streak tonight thanks to the Sacramento Kings. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Former Kings guard  Tyreke Evans  returned to Sacramento Monday night as a member of the New Orleans Pelicans and helped hand his old team a 113-100 loss.  
 Evans played well in his return, scoring a team-high 25 points and dishing out 12 assists off the Pelicans' (12-14) bench.   Anthony Davis  tossed in 21 points and 11 rebounds, while  Jrue Holiday  added 17 points and 10 assists and Eric Gordon chipped in another 17 points in the win. 
 
 DeMarcus Cousins  led the way with another strong performance for the Kings (8-19).  Sacramento's center finished with 24 points and 14 rebounds in 30 minutes of action.   Isaiah Thomas  added 21 points and five assists, and  Marcus Thornton  dropped in 19 points off the Kings bench, 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I knew they didn't have a shot-blocker, so I was going to attack every chance I get."  
 --Tyreke Evans on his big night 
 
 
 THE STAT:  New Orleans outscored the Kings on their home floor 36-23 in the fourth quarter. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Sacramento fell apart in the mid-fourth quarter and the Pelicans took control of the game.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Tyreke is probably one of the best players in this league at getting to the basket, regardless if you know him or not.  He's tough to stop."  
 --DeMarcus Cousins on Tyreke   Evans 
 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "We just wanted to get a win.  We didn't want to go back home 0-5."  
 -- Anthony Davis on the win 
 
 
 HOT:  Evans scored a game-high 25-point on 7-for-14 shooting against his former club. Thornton is off to a miserable start to the 2013-14 season, but tonight he caught fire in the first half.  The veteran guard scored 15 points on 5-for-8 shooting and hit both of his 3-point attempts in 15 first half minutes off the Sacramento bench.  
 
 NOT:  Jason Thompson  finished the game scoreless tonight in 27 minutes of action, shooting 0-for-4 from the floor.  
 
 GOOD MOVE:  New Orleans coach  Monty Williams  handed the ball over to Evans and the 2009 Rookie of the Year brought it to the court tonight. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Williams started the game with  Ryan Anderson  guarding Cousins.  Not only did Cousins start the game 6-for-8 with 16 points and 10 rebounds in the first half, but Anderson was held to just two points on the other end. 
 
 NOTABLE : Evans returned to Sacramento for the first time tonight as a member of the Pelicans after spending his first four seasons with the Kings. Cousins finished the game with his 15th double-double of the season and his 12th 20-point, 10-rebound game.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Pelicans, Friday vs. Denver, Saturday @ Houston, Monday vs. Portland. For the Kings, Friday vs. Miami, Sunday @ San Antonio, Tuesday @ Houston.
