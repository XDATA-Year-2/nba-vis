 THE FACT:  The Lakers won back-to-back games for the first time in almost a month (December 17-20 2013). In the second game of those streaks,  Nick Young  led the Lakers with 25 and 29 points respectively. 
 
 THE LEAD:  The Los Angeles Lakers (16-25) won their second game in a row --and second consecutive on the road -- defeating the Toronto Raptors (20-19) 112-106 at Air Canada Centre. The Lakers fought back from a 17-point Raptors lead in the third quarter behind a big game by Nick Young, who had a game-high 29 points coming off the bench. In his first game back after serving a one-game suspension, the Lakers guard shot 5-for-7 from behind the arc, but more importantly scored 11 points in the fourth quarter. 
 The Raptors started the second half up 58-54 and proceeded on a 15-2 run to take a 73-56 lead, but cooled off as the Lakers answered with a 15-4 burst of their own to close out the third quarter with a 82-81 edge. Both teams traded baskets during the fourth until  Pau Gasol  knocked down a pair of free throws, giving the Lakers the lead for good at 97-96 with 4:06 to play. 
 Gasol had 22 points and nine rebounds and rookie  Ryan Kelly , in his first start of the season, scored 17 points with five rebounds. For the Raptors,  DeMar DeRozan  had 23 points, seven assists and six rebounds, while  Kyle Lowry  added 21 points and nine rebounds. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We out there battling with each other. We all had a meeting after [a 121-114 loss at Phoenix on Wednesday]; we sat down and talked and now we just laying it out there." 
 --  Nick Young  on the team coming together 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Free throws: The Lakers shot 26-for-28 (92 per cent), while the Raptors were only able to get to the line 11 times, knocking down nine (81 per cent). Twenty of the Lakers' free-throw attempts came during the second half, when they were able to put points on the board and slow down the game. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Lakers rallied on a 15-4 run to close out the third quarter with a 82-81 lead. Los Angles used that momentum to compete in the fourth and break three ties amid a series of lead changes, taking the lead for good at 97-96 on a Gasol free throw with 4:07 left in the game. 
 
 HOT:  Young exploded in the second half after only scoring five points on 2-for-5 shooting from the floor in the first. He shot 5-for-8 from the field, including 4-for-5 from behind the arc and 10-for-11 from the free-throw line. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Lakers coach  Mike D'Antoni  inserting Kelly into the starting lineup after he had a career-high 20 points against the Celtics on Friday night. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Raptors and Lakers split the season series 1-1; the Lakers have never lost a season series to the Raptors in Toronto's 19-year history. The Raptors were without forward  Tyler Hansbrough  (ankle) and guard  John Salmons  (back spasms), while the Lakers were without  Kobe Bryant  (fractured knee) and  Steve Nash  (nerve foot irritation).  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Raptors, Monday @ Charlotte, Wednesday vs. Dallas, Friday @ Philadelphia. For the Lakers, Monday @ Chicago, Thursday @ Miami, Friday @ Orlando.
