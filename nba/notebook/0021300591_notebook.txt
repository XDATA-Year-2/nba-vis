 THE FACT: Goran Dragic  is averaging 19.3 points and 6.0 assists while shooting 48.2 percent from the field. The only other player to post at least 19 points and six assists while shooting at least 48 percent is  LeBron James . Since 1997-98, a player has achieved these stats over the course of a season 17 times (seven by James). In all these cases, the player has made the All-Star Game.  
 
 THE LEAD:  The Dallas Mavericks nosed out the Phoenix Suns 110-107 Friday night in Arizona. Dallas -- 24-17 at their season's midway point -- moved into the No. 7 spot in the West, one game ahead of the No. 8 Suns (22-17). 
 Dragic drove the length of the floor for a layup for the final margin with 6.4 seconds left Then,  Vince Carter  turned it over on the inbound pass, giving the Suns a chance to throw up a tying 3-pointer.  P.J. Tucker 's shot spun in and out, though replays showed Tucker had stepped over the 3-point line, so his shot wouldn't have tied the game. 
 
 Monta Ellis  led the Mavericks with 24 points, seven assists and six rebounds.  Dirk Nowitzki  added 21 points.  Shawn Marion  had a fine all-around game with 16 points, seven rebounds, two assists and zero turnovers.  
 Dragic led the Suns with 28 points, seven assists, five rebounds and just one turnover.  Markieff Morris  had a big game off the bench with 23 points and 12 boards.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Coach told us we can either fall apart or come together. Tonight, we came together."  
 -- Mavs rookie  Shane Larkin , who had a season-best 18 points 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Mavericks shot 53 percent. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  After Dragic hit a jumper to tie the game, 58-58, moments after the start of the second half, the Mavericks took off on a 13-4 run that made it 71-62. The keys were jump shots by Ellis and Marion, including a 3-pointer by Marion. Thereafter, the Suns never got closer than three points. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "This is why we drafted him. We felt like he could have this kind of impact."  
 -- Mavericks coach  Rick Carlisle  on Shane Larkin 
 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "They have great coaching.  (Jeff) Hornacek  has done a fantastic job. He will be one of the favorites for coach of the year. They are a hard-nosed, hard-playing team. They are one of the more physical teams in the league. People don't talk much about that. The defend well. They they go after rebounds."  
 -- Dallas coach Rick Carlisle on the Suns 
 
 
 HOT:  The Mavs' starting front line of Nowitzki, Marion and  Samuel Dalembert  combined to shoot 18-for-28. 
 
 NOT:  The Suns, who smoked the Mavericks a month ago with their 3-point game, hit just 7-for-22 from long range. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Larkin, who called his game "Really big...I've had rookie ups and downs" shot 6-for-8 including 3-for-4 on 3-pointers, and had five assists. For the Suns,  Archie Goodwin  had two points and three rebounds while  Alex Len  failed to score in a brief appearance. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  After missing four games with injuries, Marion has averaged 15 points on 12-for-18 shooting, plus 6.5 rebounds in the past two games. 
 
 NOTABLE: Leandro Barbosa , the Suns' backup point guard, missed his second straight game with a sore shoulder. The Suns were believed to have signed him to a second 10-day contract after the game... Gal Mekel , the Mavericks' backup point guard, had successful surgery to deal with a meniscus problem in his right knee, coach Carlisle said. Also, point guard  Devin Harris  is "getting closer" to returning from a season-long absence owing to foot surgery. But until he returns, Larkin "has got to give us solid minutes off the bench." ...The last Suns' player to average 19 points and six assists on at least 48 percent shooting was  Kevin Johnson  in '96-97 (20.1 points, 9.3 assists and .496; he is also the last player to have these numbers and not be named an All Star)...Marion started his 999th game. He will look to start No. 1,000 Saturday night, at home vs. Portland.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Saturday vs. Trail Blazers, Monday @ Cleveland and Wednesday @ Toronto. For the Suns, Sunday vs. Nuggets, Wednesday vs. Pacers and Friday vs. Wizards.
