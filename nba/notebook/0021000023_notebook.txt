
 Knicks-Celtics notebook   By Brian Robb, for NBA.com Posted Saturday October 30, 2010 1:38AM THE FACTS:   Rajon Rondo  set a career high with 24 assists, as the Boston Celtics held on for a 105-101 victory over a feisty New York Knicks squad. The Celtics point guard filled up the box score with 10 points and 10 rebounds with the 24 assists, giving Rondo the tenth triple-double of his career.  Paul Pierce  chipped in with 25 points for the victors, while  Amar'e Stoudemire  had 27 points for the Knicks in the loss. QUOTABLE:  "He got the popcorn man involved, he got the announcer involved, he got everyone involved tonight. It was beautiful to watch."   -  Pierce  speaking about Rondo's 24 assist night . THE STAT:   Paul Pierce  had 14 rebounds on the night, his highest rebound in a game since November 22, 2006 against the Charlotte Bobcats. Pierce has made a concerted effort to hit the glass more this year, averaging 8.3 rebounds a contest through the young season. TURNING POINT:  The Celtics came flying out of the gate after halftime with a 15-4 run thanks to Rondo's precision passing, helping Boston turn a four point lead into a double digit advantage. HOT:   Kevin Garnett  shot 71 percent from the field, hitting 12 of his 17 shot attempts for 24 points, to go along with 10 rebounds. NOT:   Danilo Gallinari,  who has been limited by a sore right wrist, went just 0 of 6 in just 12 minutes of action. NOTABLE:  Six Celtics players were in double figures. Rondo fell 4 assists short of Boston's single game assist record, currently held by Hall of Famer Bob Cousy.  Shaquille O'Neal  left the game in the fourth quarter with a bruised right knee and did not return. UP NEXT:  For the Knicks, Saturday vs. Portland, Tuesday vs. Orlando, Thursday @ Chicago. For the Celtics, Tuesday @ Detroit, Wednesday vs. Milwaukee, Friday vs. Chicago
