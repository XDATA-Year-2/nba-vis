  Thunder-Spurs notebook   By Tim Price, for NBA.com  Posted Saturday January 1, 2011 11:54PM THE FACTS: Tim Duncan  scored 21 points and grabbed nine rebounds in 27 minutes and the Spurs defense limited Oklahoma City to a season-low 33 percent shooting, leading San Antonio to a 101-74 whipping of the Thunder on Saturday at AT&T Center. The Spurs (29-4) have kept their last four opponents (Washington, the Lakers, Dallas and Oklahoma City) to less than 100 points each game, and they now head East for a three-game road trip to New York, Boston and Indiana. Oklahoma City (23-12) got 16 points from  Kevin Durant,  which matched a season low. QUOTABLE:  "We got a long way to go if we want to be as good as those guys. We learn from it and flush it down the toilet. We can't have this type of showing again."    -- Durant on his team's play THE STAT:  The Thunder, who shot 48 percent from the floor (and 55 percent 3-pointers) while winning Friday against Atlanta, missed 20 of their first 24 shots to open the game against San Antonio. They missed 10 of their first 12 scoring opportunities in the paint (San Antonio converted 10 of 11) and fell behind by as many as 14 in the first quarter. TURNING POINT : Despite Oklahoma City's slow start, the Thunder were plodding along and had the deficit to single digits in the third quarter. But the Spurs outscored Oklahoma City 22-7 over the final 8 ½ minutes of the quarter as the Thunder missed their last eight shots. QUOTABLE II:  "I hope this is an indication we're getting better (on defense). It was impressive tonight. Durant is a great player, but we just wanted to make it difficult for him. I think we did that."    -- Spurs coach  Gregg Popovich HOT : After scoring only two points against the Lakers on Tuesday, Duncan has 38 points and 20 rebounds in his last two outings against two Western Conference foes with winning records (Dallas and Oklahoma City are a combined 47-20). NOT:  After averaging 22.8 points against the Spurs last season (including one game of 45 points), Durant is averaging less than 20 points this season (19.5) against San Antonio. In the first meeting this season Durant needed 23 shots to get 23 points. His 16 points tonight came on 15 shots and only four trips to the free-throw line. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT: Tony Parker  has a double-double in two of his last four games (14 points on 7-of-10 shooting tonight and 10 assists). He's averaging 17.8 points in those four games. ROOKIE WATCH: Gary Neal , who's had 20-point games in three of his past six, shot 2-of-10 from the floor tonight for five points but had a career-high eight rebounds. Duncan didn't play the fourth quarter, and Tiago Splitter got those minutes. But he missed his first four shots and finished with six points in 19 ½ minutes. NOTABLE:  After winning two of the final three games against San Antonio in the 2008-09 season, the Thunder have a five-game losing streak to the Spurs. The 27-point defeat was the worst this season for Oklahoma City. UP NEXT:  For the Thunder, Tuesday @ Memphis, Thursday @ Dallas, Saturday vs. Memphis. For the Spurs, Tuesday @ New York, Wednesday @ Boston, Friday @ Indiana.
