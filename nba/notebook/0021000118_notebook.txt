
 Celtics-Heat notebook   By Shandel Richardson, for NBA.com Posted Friday November 12, 2010 12:12AM THE FACTS:   Ray Allen  scored 35 points, hitting seven 3-pointers, to lead the Boston Celtics to a 112-107 victory against the Miami Heat. It was the Celtics' second win over the Heat this season. QUOTABLE:  "I think we're better than 5-4. We're the best 5-4 team in the league, how about that?"   --  Dwyane Wade THE STAT:  The Heat were just 3-for-16 from 3-point range. TURNING POINT:  After the Heat closed to within 32-28, the Celtics went on a 7-1 to regain control. They never were seriously threatened the remainder, holding a double-digit lead most of the way. HOT:  Allen made his first seven 3-pointers, finishing 7-for-9. NOT:  Wade was 2-for-12, missing all five of his 3-pointers. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:   LeBron James  had 35 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists, nearly recording his second straight triple-double. INSIDE THE ARENA:   Alex Rodriguez  sat next to Heat owner  Micky Arison . GOOD MOVE:  The Celtics took advantage of matchup problems with  Paul Pierce  and  Nate Robinson  in key stages. Pierce scored twice over the shorter  Eddie House  and Robinson had two big buckets in the later stages while being guarded by slower forwards. BAD MOVE:  The Heat's experiment with  Joel Anthony  as the starting center appears to be over. He played just eight minutes, losing out to the experienced  Zydrunas Ilgauskas  and forward  Udonis Haslem . ROOKIE WATCH:  No rookies played NOTABLE:  Haslem scored a season-high 21 points off the bench on 9-for-10 shooting. He also grabbed 10 rebounds. UP NEXT:  For the Heat, Saturday vs. Toronto, Wednesday vs. Phoenix, Friday vs. Charlotte. For the Celtics, Saturday @ Memphis, Wednesday vs. Washington, Friday vs. Oklahoma City.
