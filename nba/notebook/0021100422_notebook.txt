  Notebook: Spurs 99, Pistons 95 Posted Tuesday February 14, 2012 11:20PM By Dana Gauruder, for NBA.com THE FACTS: Tim Duncan  had 18 points and 13 rebounds as the San Antonio increased their NBA season-high winning streak to eight games with a 99-95 victory over the Detroit Pistons Tuesday.  Tony Parker  scored seven points in the last 1:13 after the Pistons erased a 16-point deficit.  Rodney Stuckey 's 23 points and eight assists led Detroit. QUOTABLE:  "Even if we're not happy with the way we played in the fourth quarter, we can still tell ourselves we stayed in the game. Sometimes with these games, you lose it. But we fought through it, made some stops and made some big baskets at the end to win the game."   -- Parker on the Spurs' closing run THE STAT:  70 percent. San Antonio's scoring was well distributed, as seven of the 10 players coach  Gregg Popovich  used reached double figures. Parker finished with 14,  Richard Jefferson  and  Gary Neal  had 13 apiece and four other players had either 10 or 11. TURNING POINT:  With leading scorer  Greg Monroe  struggling, Pistons coach  Lawrence Frank  put  Ben Wallace  in with 6:12 remaining in the third quarter. Wallace's defense against Duncan prevented the Spurs from making it a blowout. Wallace (nine points) then shocked the Spurs in the fourth by making a 15-foot jumper and a 3-pointer, the seventh of his 16-year career. The Pistons eventually took a three-point lead before the Spurs responded with a 16-9 spurt to close out the game. QUOTABLE II:  "The way it was going, it had about a 90 percent chance of going in, just the whole situation. We played good defense for 23 seconds and we leave one guy open that we don't think can hit it and he makes it. He made a couple of plays that really got them back in the game."   -- Duncan on Wallace's 3-pointer HOT:  Duncan recorded his fifth straight double-double despite being held to six second-half points. He is averaging 17.4 points, 11.7 rebounds and 2.3 blocks over the last seven games. NOT:  Monroe's four points tied a season low. He had been averaging 21.3 points in six games this month. Duncan was primarily responsible for shutting down Monroe, who didn't play in the fourth quarter. NOTABLE:  Pistons center  Ben Wallace  broke  Avery Johnson 's record of 1,054 career games by an undrafted player since the 1976-77 NBA-ABA merger. Wallace and Johnson are the only undrafted players who have reached the 1,000-game mark.  Moses Malone  holds the all-time record with 1,329 games but was an ABA draft pick in 1974 and was chosen by Portland in the 1976 ABA Dispersal Draft. ... Spurs reserve forward  Tiago Splitter  recorded his 15th double-digit game this season with 13 points. ... San Antonio is 4-0 on its annual 'rodeo' trip with five games remaining. ...  Tayshaun Prince  added 18 points for the Pistons. UP NEXT:  For the Spurs, Wednesday @ Toronto, Saturday @ L.A. Clippers, Monday @ Utah. For the Pistons, Wednesday @ Boston, Friday vs. Sacramento, Sunday vs. Boston.
