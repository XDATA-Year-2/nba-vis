 THE FACTS: Brandan Wright  crashed  Jason Terry's  homecoming party Friday and powered the Dallas Mavericks to a 104-94 defeat of the Boston Celtics at the American Airlines Center. Punctuating his breakout performance with a thunderous, alley-oop slam, Wright finished with a season-high 23 points and eight rebounds. 
 
 Dirk Nowitzki  added 22 points,  Vince Carter  scored 19 off the bench and  Shawn Marion  delivered a double-double with 11 points and 13 rebounds in his return from an eight-game absence due to a strained left calf. The Mavericks (33-36) improved to 8-4 in the month of March. 
 Terry, who played eight seasons with Dallas from 2004-12 and is one of the most popular players in team history, received a standing ovation when he checked into the game in the first quarter. That was as good as it got for Terry, who tallied eight points on 3-for-9 shooting with three turnovers.  Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce  and  Brandon Bass  each scored 16 to lead the Celtics (36-32), losers of three straight and five of their last seven. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It was just another game for me. Hall of Fame status or not, I respect him as a player. I go out there and play hard. I've got a little bit of game, too." --  Wright on playing against   Garnett.  
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Celtics are 2-11 on the road against the West. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  For just the second time this season, the Mavericks never trailed (113-98 victory against Minnesota on Jan. 14 in Dallas). Boston whittled what had been a 14-point deficit to 97-92 with less than two minutes to play, but Wright kept the ensuing Dallas possession alive with his fifth offensive rebound and  O.J. Mayo  drained the 3-point dagger. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "[The ovation] was a good feeling, but again, I was solely locked in on the game. It was good to see everyone again, but again, I'm a Celtic now." --  Terry. 
 
 
 HOT:  The Celtics shot 92.6 percent (25-for-27) at the free-throw line. They were 17-for-17 during the first half. 
 
 NOT:  In his two games since scoring 43 points in Monday's loss against Miami,  Jeff Green  has averaged 12.0 points. He committed five of Boston's 14 turnovers against the Mavericks. ... Carter was 1-for-7 from 3-point distance. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Starting the long and athletic Wright was key to the Mavericks' success. It was his 13th start of the season, but his first since March 6 and just his second since Dec. 10. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Bass (11 rebounds) and Garnett (12 rebounds) both had double-doubles. Mayo had a game-high nine assists -- seven in the second half. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The Dallas crowd showed a lot of love for Terry, a member of the 2010-11 NBA championship team and the 2008-09 Sixth Man of the Year. He ranks second in Mavericks history in 3-point field goals (1,140), fifth in steals (735), sixth in points (9,953) and seventh in assists (2,524). Unfortunately for his fans, he was 0-for-2 from behind the arc and didn't get to break out his patented "Jet wings" celebration.  
 
 NOTABLE:  Dallas is 9-4 at home against the East. ... The Mavericks are 21-4 when dishing 25 or more assists (26) and 20-8 when holding opponents under 100 points. ... Boston's  Courtney Lee  had to be carried to the bench with 1:21 left in the game after spraining his left ankle. Rivers said the injury did not appear to be serious. ... It was only the second 20-point game ever for Wright, who scored 25 for Golden State against Philadelphia on March 29, 2009. ... Dallas announced after the game that guard  Chris Wright  would not be signed to a second 10-day contract. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Sunday vs. Utah, Tuesday vs. L.A. Clippers, Thursday vs. Indiana. For the Celtics, Saturday @ Memphis, Tuesday vs. New York, Wednesday @ Cleveland.
