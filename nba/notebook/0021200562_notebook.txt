 THE FACTS: Kevin Durant  and  Russell Westbrook  combined to score 47 of Oklahoma City's 51 second-half points to power the Thunder past the reeling Phoenix Suns 102-90 on Monday night for their league-leading 30th victory. 
 Durant matched a season high with 41 points and Westbrook added a season-best 36 for the Thunder (30-8).  Kevin Martin  was the only only other Thunder player in double figures with 12. 
 Durant had 22 points after three quarters but scored 19 in the fourth on 8-for-12 shooting, adding an exclamation point with a tomahawk dunk over  Marcin Gortat.  Durant fell to the floor as he drew the foul but calmly sank his ninth free throw in as many attempts for his final point. 
 
 Shannon Brown  scored 21 points and Gortat finished with 19 points and 15 rebounds in 46-plus minutes for the Suns (13-27), who have dropped 12 of their past 14. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "It was just the natural flow of the game, how they were playing us. Russ [Westbrook] got it going early, I tried to play off of everybody and my teammates just told me to go be aggressive."  
 -- Kevin Durant 
 
 THE STAT : Durant and Westbrook took 33 of the Thunder's 41 second-half shots and exceeded the second-half output of eight teams who played on Monday night including the Suns, who scored 45 after halftime. 
 
 THE STAT II:  K endrick Perkins  had a season-high 13 rebounds while scoring zero points on four attempts. 
 
 THE STAT III : Unbalanced scoring has worked this season for the Thunder. Oklahoma City is 18-4 when Durant and Westbrook each score at least 20 points. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "What can we do? I don't know. I'm going to be silly, but maybe break his arm or break his leg? You can't do anything. You could double him, triple him and he's still going to score."  
 -- Martin Gortat on Durant 
 
 TURNING POINT : The Suns cut the Thunder's lead to four points, 76-72, on Gortat's alley-oop dunk off a pass from  Sebastian Telfair  with 10:03 left. Durant missed a 10-foot bank shot, but Hasheem Thabeet rebounded and fed the ball back to Durant for a long 3-pointer that put Oklahoma City ahead 79-72 with 9:31 to go. 
 
 NOTABLE : Durant has 25 career 40-point games, four this season. ... Oklahoma City was without Serge Ibaka, who missed his second straight game with a chest bruise. Suns forward Jared Dudley missed his second consecutive game with a strained right wrist. ... The Thunder have won five straight in Phoenix and eight in a row against the Suns overall. ... Suns forward Michael Beasley, after missing two of his first free-throw attempts off the side of the rim, walked down the lane, stared up at the iron and shook his head. "I had to scare the gremlins away," he said. "Those gremlins are always messing with me." 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA : Boxing champ  Floyd Mayweather Jr.  was sitting courtside, while  Kareen Abdul-Jabbar  was sitting next to former Suns managing general partner and current USA Basketball chief  Jerry Colangelo  a few rows off the floor. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Thunder, Wednesday vs. Denver, Friday @ Dallas, Sunday @ Denver. For the Suns, Thursday vs. Milwaukee, January 23 @ Sacramento, January 24 vs. L.A. Clippers.
