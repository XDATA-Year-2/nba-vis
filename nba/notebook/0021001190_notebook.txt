  Cavaliers-Bucks notebook   By Rick Braun, for NBA.com Posted Saturday April 9, 2011 11:50PM THE FACTS:   John Salmons  scored 32 points on 14-of-18 shooting and  Drew Gooden  had his first career triple-double with 15 points, 13 rebounds and 13 assists to lead the Milwaukee Bucks to a 108-101 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers Saturday night at the Bradley Center. QUOTABLE:  "Maybe in a couple of practices. I'm a good practice player at trying to be Magic Johnson."   -- Drew Gooden on the last time he might have had 13 assists THE STAT:  With Gooden leading the way, the Bucks tallied 31 assists on their 41 made field goals. Gooden's 13 assists shattered his previous career high of eight.  Brandon Jennings  also chipped in nine assists. And thanks to all that ball movement the Bucks shot 50.6 percent. They're 12-0 when shooting 50 percent or better. TURNING POINT:  The Bucks led from the start, but the Cavs rallied in the third quarter. From there, Salmons had every answer. When Cleveland cut it to 85-83 with 10:18 left, Salmons drove the lane for a layup to halt an 11-0 run and then added a 10-footer. When the Cavs scored the next four points, Salmons answered with a 17-footer and then drove the lane and kicked the ball to the corner for a wide-open 3-pointer by  Michael Redd  that made it 94-87 with 6:19 left. Finally, after Cleveland got within 99-95 with 1:25 left, Salmons drained a 10-foot banker with 1:09 left for his final points of the night. QUOTABLE II:  "Early on I didn't feel any different from any other night. I don't know how many I made in a row but I know I hit my first three. After the third one I felt like I was in a pretty good groove."   -- John Salmons, who made his first eight shots. HOT:  Doesn't get any hotter than Salmons' 14-for-18 showing. He entered the night shooting 40.2 percent after being below 40 percent most of the season. After Saturday's game he improved to 41percent (358 of 874). FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Gooden's triple-double might have won some fantasy contests, but he probably wasn't on many rosters after missing 47 games with plantar fasciitis in his left foot. GOOD MOVE:  With centers  Andrew Bogut  and  Jon Brockman  both out for the rest of the season, Bucks coach  Scott Skiles  started Gooden for the first time since Nov. 26. ROOKIE WATCH:  Playing in his second game after returning from a strained groin, Cleveland's  Semih Erden  logged 23 minutes and had six points, three rebounds and two blocked shots. NOTABLE:  The Bucks announced before the game that Bogut would undergo surgery on his right elbow Tuesday to clean out bone chips and scar tissue. The surgery will be performed by noted orthopedic  James Andrews . ... Brockman will miss the remaining two games with a separated left shoulder. ... The Bucks did not commit a foul in the first quarter until  Carlos Delfino  violated  Alonzo Gee  with 1.4 seconds left. ... The Bucks improved to 3-16 in games where they allow the opponent to break the century mark. ... Gooden's triple-double was the Bucks' second of the season, as Jennings recorded one against Charlotte on Oct. 30. The last time the Bucks had two triple-doubles in a season was the 2002-03 season when  Sam Cassell  recorded two. The last time the Bucks had two different players record triple-doubles in a season was the 1986-87 when  Terry Cummings  and  Paul Pressey  did the trick. Pressey was on hand Saturday night as he's a Cavaliers assistant coach. UP NEXT:  For the Cavaliers, Monday @ Detroit, Wednesday vs. Washington. For the Bucks, Monday vs. Toronto, Wednesday @ Oklahoma City.
