 THE FACT:  Memphis entered Friday night having won 17 straight when shooting at least 50 percent. The Pelicans ended that streak, downing the Grizzlies despite Memphis shooting exactly 50 percent. 
 THE LEAD: With Anthony Davis out of New Orleans' lineup because of a broken hand, Pelicans coach  M onty Williams  has consistently said a different player will have to step up each night. He got one Friday night, helping the Pelicans drop the Grizzlies 104-98. 
 
 Eric Gordon  put up 25 points on 10-for-12 shooting for New Orleans (11-10), including going 3-for-3 from 3-point range, grabbed four rebounds and dished out four assists. 
 The Grizzlies (10-12) took a one-time 19-point deficit down to six on  Mike Miller' s 3-pointer with 4:53 to play.  New Orleans' lead proved too much to overcome, however, as the Pelicans managed to hold off Memphis by equaling the Grizzlies over the final four minutes. 
 
 Jrue Holiday  complemented Gordon with 20 points, 12 assists and no turnovers for New Orleans, which also got 18 points from  Ryan Anderson . 
 For Memphis,  Jon Leuer  led with 19 off the bench while  Mike Conley  pitched in 18 points and seven assists.  Zach Randolph  put up 13 points and 10 rebounds in spite of playing in foul trouble in the second half. 
 For just the second time this season, New Orleans is above .500. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "I can make it work every single night. I've shown that I can score at any point during the game. With me tonight, I was just hitting everything basically."  
 
 --New Orleans' Eric Gordon 
 
 
 THE STAT:  4-for-20 -- The game got away from Memphis in the third quarter when the Grizzlies went 4-for-20 shooting, scoring only 11 points. New Orleans won the quarter by 16 points and gave it a lead that was too much to overcome. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Memphis' 21-10 run in the fourth quarter was stopped cold thanks to a timeout called by Williams with 3:59 to play. The idea, Williams said, was to slow down the Grizzlies. It also allowed him to set up a play for Gordon, who answered with a 20-foot pull-up jumper that pushed the lead back to eight. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We played (well) in the first half offensively. The ball was moving and we got good looks. The second half, we didn't cut and we didn't screen. They became the aggressors and that's the way it went."  
 --Grizzlies coach  Dave Joerger 
 
 
 HOT:   With Memphis'  Marc Gasol  continuing to heal from a sprained medial collateral ligament in his left knee, the Grizzlies have turned a little bit more to Leuer. He gave them good reason Friday night, going 8-for-10 for a team-best 19 points. He also grabbed eight rebounds 
 
 NOTABLE:  Pelican  Tyreke Evans  re-aggravated a left ankle sprain at the end of the first half and didn't return to the game. He finished with six points, all on free throws. ... Memphis outrebounded New Orleans 42-31, including coming down with 12 offensive rebounds. .... Memphis is 0-6 against the Southwest Division this season. ... New Orleans is one of only four teams since 2009 to start the first 21 games without turning the ball over at least 18 times. ... Memphis' bench scored 51 point, 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Pelicans, Sunday @ Denver, Tuesday @ Golden State, Wednesday @ Clippers. For the Grizzlies, Sunday vs. Minnesota, Tuesday vs. Lakers, Wednesday @ Dallas.
