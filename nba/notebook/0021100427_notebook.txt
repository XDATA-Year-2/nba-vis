  Notebook: Wizards 124, Blazers 109 Posted Wednesday February 15, 2012 1:48AM By Kerry Eggers, for NBA.com THE FACTS:   Nick Young  scored a season-high 33 points and had plenty of help as Washington blew away Portland 124-109 Tuesday night at the Rose Garden. Young sank 12 of 17 shots, including 7-for-8 3-pointers, as the Wizards (7-22) rolled to their second straight win to start a five-game road trip.  John Wall  added 29 points and  Jordan Crawford  21 as the three Wizards guards combined for 83 points.  Nicolas Batum  tied his career high with 33 points for the Blazers (15-14), who lost their third straight game at home. The Blazers lost All-Star forward  LaMarcus Aldridge  to a sprained left ankle 1:55 into the game. QUOTABLE:  "That's as complete a game as we've played this year. Our guys were in tune. We moved the ball as well as we've moved it. We shot the heck out of it."   -- Washington coach  Randy Wittman . THE STAT:  Washington shot .600 from the field, including .529 (9-for-17) from 3-point range. TURNING POINT:  Portland trimmed a 17-point deficit to nine at 89-82 late in the third quarter. The Wizards responded with an 8-0 run to jack the lead to 15 at 97-82, and the Blazers never got closer than eight the rest of the way. QUOTABLE II:  "We say we are a defensive team, blah blah blah. When [the Wizards] score more than 28 in each quarter, that's a bad game -- maybe the worst game we've played this year. Defensively for sure; overall, one of the worst."    -- Portland's Nicolas Batum. HOT:  Young, Wall and Crawford combined to make 31 of 47 shots from the field -- 9-for-13 on 3s. NOT:  Portland's  Jamal Crawford  never got his game going, hitting 1-for-5 shots from the field and scoring three points in 23 minutes off the bench. QUOTABLE III:  "When [LaMarcus Aldridge] went down, that took the life out of us. Sad, but it's true. We didn't come with the mindset that we had at shootaround for a game we desperately needed to win."    -- Portland's  Marcus Camby  on the loss of teammate Aldridge to a sprained left ankle two minutes into the game. INSIDE THE ARENA:   Russell Hornsby , actor on the television show "Grimm," was in the house. GOOD MOVE:  Coach  Nate McMillan  started Batum at shooting guard in place of  Wesley Matthews . Batum was terrific as a starter and Matthews was productive off the bench with 15 points and five rebounds. BAD MOVE:  Unintentionally, Aldridge came down on the foot of defender  Trevor Booker  after sinking a fadeaway jump shot early. It was the end of Aldridge's night. NOTABLE:  Washington entered the game averaging 90.3 points, 25th in the NBA. The Wizards beat their average by nearly 34 points. It was the most points Portland has given up this season, well above the 111 yielded in an overtime loss to Oklahoma City on Feb. 6. UP NEXT:  For the Blazers, Wednesday at Golden State, Thursday vs. L.A. Clippers, Saturday vs. Atlanta. For the Wizards, Wednesday at L.A. Clippers, Friday at Utah, Monday at Phoenix.
