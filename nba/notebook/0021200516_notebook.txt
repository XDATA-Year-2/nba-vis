 THE FACTS:  It wasn't pretty, but the Toronto Raptors (13-22) won their eighth of their last ten games, defeating the Philadelphia 76ers (15-22) 90-72 on Wednesday night at the Air Canada Centre. The Raptors evened out their season-high six game homestand at 2-2, while the 76ers suffered their fifth loss in a row and are 5-16 since the start of December. 
 
 Amir Johnson  led all Raptors starters in double digit scoring with his double-double of 19 points and 12 rebounds,  DeMar DeRozan  also scored 19.  Ed Davis  had 17 points and 9 rebounds while  Jose Calderon  added 14 points and a game-high 11 assists.  Landry Fields  had his first double-double of the season with a season high in both points and rebounds, with 10 and 11, after being re-inserted back into the starting lineup. 
 Toronto took their 42-40 lead at halftime and slowly added it to it with a solid third quarter shooting .632 percent with Calderon scoring 10 points and 3 assists, ending with a 10 point lead at 71-61. While the 76ers closed the gap to with 6 points with 6:40 left the Raptors went on 7-1 run, outscoring them in the quarter 19-11 to take their biggest lead of the game at 18 points. 
 The 76ers were led by  Jrue Holiday  and  Thaddeus Young' s 16 points, while  Evan Turner  added 10 points, 7 rebounds and 5 assists. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "That was an Eastern Conference grinder. You talk about one of the top defensive teams, Doug (Collins) is always going to coach a tough style of basketball. Our guys did a good job, shorthanded and grinded it out. Everybody who stepped in tonight did a solid job." 
 -- Raptors Head Coach  Dwane Casey 
 
 
 THE STAT:  While The Raptors outperformed the 76ers in almost every statistical category, you can point to the scoring by half. Toronto outscored Philadelphia 48-32 in the second half, after playing a close game after the first, 42-40. The Raptors ability to get stops, score on the offensive end and put together runs is what made the difference. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  In the third quarter the Raptors were able to push their lead to 12 with 1:39 left after an  Alan Anderson  3-pointer. The 76ers never threatened after that point. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I think we knew it was kind of flat and we needed to come back and do the right thing and we did, we ran, we limited them to one shot, we boxed out a bit better and it was great for us." 
 -- Raptors guard Calderon on his team's play in the second half. 
 
 
 HOT:  Johnson in his second straight start for the Raptors did everything as asked, scoring 19 points, pulling 12 rebounds and adding 5 assists.  
 
 NOT:  Despite contributing 7 rebounds and 5 assists, Turner shot 4-for-15 from the field and added 4 turnovers. His 10 points were hard earned, as the 76ers needed a spark from someone. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Prior to tip, Casey inserted Fields into the starting lineup in place of  Mickael Pietrus , who has rounded into form since wrist surgery. The move paid off with his best game of the season, notching his first double-double of the season with 10 points, 11 rebounds and 3 steals. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  With the game in hand and the Raptors up by 16, Calderon threw an alley oop to Fields with 15 seconds on the clock as he crossed over half court. Both coaches were unhappy with the play and Calderon apologized immediately after he realized.  
 
 NOTABLE:  Raptors rookie  Terrence Ross  didn't dress due to a left sprained ankle injury.  
 With Toronto's second win of their six-game homestand, both have been wire-to-wire victories. Philadelphia is 2-12 on the road since the start of December and have lost seven of their last eight games. The Raptors avoided a season sweep after losing the first two games to Philadelphia this season. The 72 points the 76eers scored is a season low. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Raptors; Friday vs. Charlotte, Sunday vs. Milwaukee, Tuesday @ Brooklyn. For the 76ers; Saturday vs. Houston, Tuesday vs. New Orleans and Friday vs. Toronto.
