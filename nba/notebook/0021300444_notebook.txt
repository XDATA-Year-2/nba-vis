 THE FACT:  Kevin Love  added to his league-leading double-double tally, notching his 27th this season in the Timberwolves win. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Love posted 33 points and 15 rebounds as the Minnesota Timberwolves built a 31-point lead and cruised to a 117-95 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks Saturday night at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. 
 
 Kevin Martin  chipped in 20 points and  Nikola Pekovic  added 19 points and 11 rebounds, as Minnesota (15-15) used a dominant third quarter to put the game away. 
 
 Khris Middleton  led Milwaukee (6-24) with 23 points and nine rebounds, but the Bucks lost their third straight and eighth in nine games. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Just the way we played defense -- got back on defense -- and then forced them into tough shots. It seemed like that led to easy buckets for us, and we really had a good rhythm on the offensive end." 
 -- Kevin Love on Minnesota's dominant third quarter 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Before missing their final five tries in a cold fourth quarter, the Timberwolves made 11 of their first 19 3-pointers. It was the second straight night the Bucks allowed double-digit 3-pointers, as they allowed 12 in a loss at Brooklyn Friday night. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Timberwolves opened the third quarter with a 14-0 run and pushed their lead to as many as 31 points. That allowed them to withstand a 1-for-17 start to the fourth quarter and never be seriously threatened. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I never thought we were going to lose it, but we've got to learn our lessons. That group played pretty good in the second quarter, but in the fourth quarter they just started playing like a rec game." 
 -- Minnesota coach  Rick Adelman  on his second unit 
 
 
 HOT:  Love made 11-for-17, including 4 of his 6 tries from behind the arc. 
 
 NOT:  Bucks forward  Ersan Ilyasova  was just 2-for-10 and is now 10-for-56 over his last six games. He's been bothered by a bad ankle since training camp, and is shooting just 36 percent (63-for-175) on the season. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Love added six assists and a steal to his 33-15 line.  
 
 GOOD MOVE:  When the Bucks crawled to within 107-90 with 5:32 left, Adelman re-inserted starters Martin, Love and  Ricky Rubio  into the lineup. The Bucks got three points closer, but the Timberwolves then restored order. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Bucks swingman  Giannis Antetokounmpo  had a couple of highlight dunks and finished with six points, five rebounds, four assists, four steals and two blocked shots in 31 minutes. He also had a season-high four turnovers. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Second-year player  John Henson , the Bucks' most effective big man this season, sat out the game with an injury to his lower left leg. He originally suffered the injury in a collision with Cleveland's  Anderson Varejao  on Dec. 20 and missed the game the next night with what was then called a bruised left knee. He returned for games Monday and Friday but was limping noticeably after Friday night's 104-93 loss at Brooklyn.  Larry Sanders , who returned Friday from nearly two months out with a thumb injury, started in his place and had nine points and 10 rebounds. ... The Timberwolves swept both nights of a back-to-back for the second time in eight tries. ... Love recorded his 218th career double-double in his 316th career game. ... Love has now scored 25 or more points in 10 straight games, the longest streak in the NBA this season.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Timberwolves, Monday vs. Dallas, Wednesday vs. New Orleans, Saturday vs. Oklahoma City. For the Bucks, Tuesday @ Los Angeles Lakers, Thursday @ Utah, Saturday @ Phoenix.
