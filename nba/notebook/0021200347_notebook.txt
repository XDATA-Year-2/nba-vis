 THE FACTS: Kobe Bryant  scored 34 points in an impressive 40-minute performance, lifting the Los Angeles Lakers past the Philadelphia 76ers 111-98 Sunday night at the Wells Fargo Center.  Metta World Peace  scored 19 points and swept a career-high 16 rebounds while  Dwight Howard  also contributed 17 points and 11 rebounds.  Darius Morris  had a career-best 15 points for the Lakers.  Chris Duhon  scored 14 points and  Jodie Meeks  had 12 against his former team. The Lakers improved to 11-14. 
 
 Nick Young  scored a season-high 30 points for the Sixers, who fell to 12-12 and lost their third straight game for the first time this season.  Evan Turner  and  Spencer Hawes  had 16 points each and  Thaddeus Young  added 14. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "When you throw the ball up every night, it's about 48 minutes of playing hard. Two nights in a row, it's worked." 
 -- Lakers coach  Mike D'Antoni , on the team's first two-game winning streak in almost one month 
 
 THE STAT : The Lakers were 14-for-34 from 3-point land. Five different Lakers converted at least one trey. 
 
 TURNING POINT : After the Sixers closed the gap to 91-82 early in the fourth quarter, the Lakers pulled away with a quick 9-3 spurt. From that point, they were never threatened again. 
 
 HOT : Bryant was 12-for-21 and World Peace knocked down six of his 10 shots. Morris made his first five shots and finished 5-for-8. 
 
 NOT : Turner missed 10 of his 16 shots and never found his rhythm for the Sixers. The same goes for sharpshooter  Jason Richardson , who misfired on five of his eight attempts. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "We have to keep moving forward, keep working hard and good things will happen." 
 -- Kobe Bryant 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA : Forget the fact that the Lakers have been struggling. Whenever Bryant and the Lakers come to Philadelphia, the crowd is always electric. This was no different. The fans were energetic from the opening tip and remained that way all night. Former Sixers greats  Wali Jones  and  Julius Erving  were part of the honorary tip before the game started. Eagles running back LeSean McCoy also was in attendance and received a nice ovation. 
 
 QUOTABLE III : "We have to keep playing and keep fighting and focusing in." 
 -- Thaddeus Young 
 
 GOOD MOVE : The Lakers were given open looks from beyond the arc and, to their credit, they kept shooting. Yes, the Lakers were 14-for-34, but they started 10-for-15 and it gave them a 10-point lead at halftime which never was relinquished. 
 
 BAD MOVE : The Sixers' coaching staff probably could have started forward  Dorell Wright  and given him more minutes, especially since they were short-handed. Wright's minutes have been up and down much of the season. He came off the bench and played 26:14. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH : Lakers center  Robert Sacre  was scoreless in 6:11. For the Sixers, guard  Maalik Wayns  didn't score in a brief 50-second stint while forward  Arnett Moultrie  received a DNP-CD. 
 
 NOTABLE : Sixers point guard  Jrue Holiday  missed his second straight game with a sprained left foot. ... Lakers center  Jordan Hill  sat out with back spasms. ... The Lakers set a Wells Fargo Center record -- dating to 1996 -- for most 3-pointers made in a half with 10 in the first half. ... The Lakers also made seven straight shots in the first quarter. ... Sixers center  Kwame Brown  received a technical foul early in the third. ... The Lakers improved to 10-6 when scoring 100 or more points. ... Bryant reached 30 or more points for the sixth game in a row. ... World Peace's double-double was his first since Jan. 13, 2010. ... The Lakers have hit 10 or more 3-pointers 10 times this season. ... Young  became the second Philadelphia player to reach the 30-point plateau in a game this season. Holiday accomplished the feat with 33 against Phoenix on Nov. 25. 
 
 NEXT : For the Lakers, Tuesday vs. Charlotte, Saturday @ Golden State, Dec. 25 vs. New York. For the Sixers, Tuesday @ Dallas, Wednesday @ Houston, Friday vs. Atlanta.
