 THE FACT: Jeff Hornacek  became the first person in NBA history to win both the player and Coach of the Month honors with the same franchise.  
 
 THE LEAD:  The Suns had their questionable depth tested Thursday night. They flunked. 
 The visiting Memphis Grizzlies (14-17), outside of a wild Suns' run in the third quarter, slowed the game to their preferred pace and came up with a 99-91 win. 
 The Suns played without  Eric Bledsoe , who was a last-minute scratch because of right-knee sprain.  Gerald Green  started instead. 
 
 Goran Dragic  exploded for his career scoring high, 33, but the Grizzlies kept the other Suns (19-12) quiet while shutting down the Suns' 3-point game. 
 
 Zach Randolph  had 20 points and 15 boards for the Grizzlies, who also got big bench contributions from  Jerryd Bayless , who scored 17 (11 in the fourth quarter) while playing in his hometown, and  Ed Davis  (16 points, 11 rebounds). 
 The Suns went on an 18-0 run -- highlighted by driving layups, steals and fast breaks -- to take a 62-57 lead in the third quarter. But the Grizzlies started the fourth quarter with a 13-2 spurt to grab an 82-75 lead. 
 Bayless hit a 3-pointer to give them a 94-84 lead with 4:30 left, and the Grizzlies coasted home. 
 The Grizzlies are 2-0 against the Suns this season, having beaten them on Dec. 3 in Memphis.  
 
 QUOTABLE : "It's tough to play at that pace. They practice that way. They play that way. It's not our style."  --  Grizzlies point guard  Mike Conley  on how his team wanted to dictate the tempo 
 
 
 THE STAT : The Grizzlies' bench players outscored the Suns' reserves 54-15. 
 
 TURNING POINT: Mike Miller  hit two free throws, then Bayless nailed a 3-pointer to start the Grizzlies on their decisive 13-2 run to start the final quarter. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We are kind of the knuckleball. We are built differently. We have to try to play from a lead."  --  Grizzlies coach  Dave Joerger  on how his team differs from many others in the generally high-scoring, up-tempo West  
 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "I take it as a team award. I didn't shoot any baskets, and I didn't get any rebounds or any assists. Obviously, the players played great."  --  Hornacek on the Coach of the  M onth award 
 
 
 HOT:  Davis shot 8-for-11.  
 
 NOT : The Suns shot just 8-for-30 on 3-pointers and just 9-for-16 from the free-throw line. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH : The Suns'  Archie Goodwin  failed to score in five minutes. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  The Grizzlies' Davis has shot 17-for-23 for 41 points over his last three games. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Hornacek joins  Cotton Fitzsimmons, Paul Westphal, Frank Johnson, Mike D'Antoni  and  Alvin Gentry  as Suns' coaches who have won the Coach of the Month award....The Grizzlies outrebounded the Suns, 59-40; the 59 rebounds represent the most allowed to a Suns' opponent since the New York Knicks grabbed 59 against them on Nov. 7, 2011... Randolph had his 16th double-double in his past 22 games....The Suns had started the same 5-man lineup for the 13 straight games until Bledsoe's scratch.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Grizzlies, Friday @ Denver, Los Angeles Lakers, Sunday @ Detroit and Tuesday vs. Spurs. For the Suns, Saturday vs. Bucks, Tuesday @ Chicago and Wednesday @ Minnesota.
