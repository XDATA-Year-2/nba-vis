 THE FACTS: Evan Turner  scored 22 points,  Spencer Hawes  had 19 and  Jrue Holiday  had 11 of his 14 in the fourth quarter, including nine in a row at one point, to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 100-92 victory over the Charlotte Bobcats on Saturday night at the Wells Fargo Center.  
 Holiday was 2 for 13 before hitting his last four shots.  
 
 Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  led the Bobcats with 21 and  Gerald Henderson  had 19 after averaging 34.5 over the past two games. 
 The Sixers have won three straight, though they're close to being eliminated from playoff contention. The Bobcats have the NBA's worst record. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "When it comes down to the crucial moments, I think my team has a lot of faith in me. My teammates and coaches encouraged me to make plays to close out the game." --  Holiday. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Sixers had lost 31 straight games when allowing their opponent to shoot at least 50 percent. The Bobcats were exactly 50 percent from the floor (38 for 76), but Philadelphia got the win anyway. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Holiday drove through the lane and threw down a left-handed jam over  Bismack Biyombo  and  Josh McRoberts  to give the Sixers a 91-84 lead with 4:10 left. 
 
 HOT:  Hawes was 8 for 12 and extended his career-best streak to nine consecutive games in double figures. He finished with six rebounds, falling short of his fifth double-double in six games. 
 
 NOT: Kemba Walker  was 6 for 14 and 0 for 3 from 3-point range for the Bobcats. He hit a couple clutch shots down the stretch, however. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I thought the big play was Jrue's dunk. That gave us some juice." --  Sixers coach  Doug Collins. 
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Kidd-Gilchrist had 19 points and nine rebounds, Henderson had seven assists to go with his 19 points and Walker finished with 14 points and nine assists. 
 Turner had seven rebounds with his 22 points,  Thaddeus Young  had 15 points and 10 boards, Holiday added nine assists with the 14 points.  
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  Former Sixers star  Allen Iverson , the 2000-01 NBA MVP, was introduced to the crowd before the opening tip-off. Iverson, wearing a Phillies zip-up, cap and black sunglasses, got a rousing ovation. He cupped his ear, drawing louder applause, and then high-fived some fans. Flyers forward  Wayne Simmonds  and Phillies outfielders  Domonic Brown, Ben Revere  and  John Mayberry Jr.  also were at the game.  
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "Holiday made a couple of big plays, and obviously Kemba was good at the end, but we just couldn't stop them from scoring." --  Henderson. 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Putting the ball in Holiday's hands down the stretch even though he was struggling. Holiday responded by making his last four shots and leading the Sixers to the win. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  After getting within 93-90 with 1:14 left, the Bobcats left the hot-shooting Holiday open to nail a 15-footer.  
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Kidd-Gilchrist was 9 of 11 for 21 points and added nine boards.  Jeff Taylor  didn't play. For Philadelphia,  Arnett Moultrie  didn't play. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Young recorded his 19th double-double of the season after getting just one in 2011-12.  
 
 NEXT:  For the Bobcats, Monday @ Milwaukee, Wednesday vs. Philadelphia, Friday vs. Miami. For the Sixers, Wednesday @ Charlotte, Friday @ Atlanta, Saturday @ Miami.
