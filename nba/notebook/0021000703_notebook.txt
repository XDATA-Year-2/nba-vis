  Magic-Cavaliers Notebook   By Dick Scanlon, for NBA.com Posted Sunday January 30, 2011 10:16PM THE FACTS:  The Cleveland Cavaliers became the first NBA team in this century to lose 20 straight games. Ryan Anderson  scored a career-high 23 points for Orlando and added a career-high 16 rebounds as the Magic led all the way in a 103-87 victory. Before sitting out the fourth quarter,  Dwight Howard  had 20 points and 20 rebounds for the Magic. Rookie  Manny Harris  led the Cavaliers with 20 points and rookie  Samardo Samuel  added a career-high 16 for Cleveland, which has lost 30 of its last 31 games. QUOTABLE:  "It is tough, but we are still trying to deal with the grind of it."  - Cavs forward  Antawn Jamison . THE STAT:  Even after the Magic's poor 3-point shooting (9-for-31), Cleveland opponents are shooting better from behind the 3-point line (.426) than the Cavs are shooting overall (.424). TURNING POINT:  The Cavaliers were playing catch-up all night after the Magic's 67 percent shooting in the first quarter left them 16 points behind. QUOTABLE II:  "The first quarter kiled us. You get down 33-17 and then it's going to be a battle all night long. Against teams like this, it's going to be hard to win. We've got to figure out a way to stay closer in the first half."  - Cleveland coach  Byron Scott . HOT:  Ryan Anderson has led the Magic in scoring in three of their last seven games and is shooting .449 from behind the arc in his last 11 games. NOT:  Antawn Jamison missed all seven of his shots in the first half and finished 2-for-11. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Howard's 20/20 was his fourth of the season and 30th of his career. He played only 26 minutes. QUOTABLE III:  "Dwight and Ryan were both great, so we come out with the win and we moved on."  - Magic coach  Stan Van Gundy . ROOKIE WATCH:  Manny Harris and Samardo Samuels were the Cavaliers' top two scorers, and fellow-rookie  Christian Eyenga  scored four of their first five baskets. NOTABLE:  If they lose in Miami tonight, the Cavaliers' 21-game losing streak will match the fourth-longest in NBA history. Only the Cavaliers of 1981-82 and 1982-83 (24), the Vancouver Grizzlies of 1995-96 (23) and the Denver Nuggets of 1997-98 (23) lost more consecutive games. The Detroit Pistons also lost 21 straight in 1979-80 and 1980-81 . . . The Cavs'  Daniel Gibson  left the game with a bruised left quad, and Scott said: "I think we may have to shut him down for a game or two." . . . The Magic's  Gilbert Arenas  sat out the game with a left knee contusion. UP NEXT:  For the Cavaliers, Monday @ Miami, Wednesday vs. Indiana, Friday @ Memphis. For the Magic, Monday @ Memphis, Thursday vs. Miami, Friday @ Washington.
