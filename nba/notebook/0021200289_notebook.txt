 THE FACTS: Josh Smith  had 24 points and  Lou Williams  scored 21 off the bench -- including 13 during a momentum-swinging 20-0 third-quarter scoring run -- to push the visiting Atlanta Hawks past the Memphis Grizzlies 93-83 at FedExForum on Saturday. The Hawks, who got a fifth consecutive double-double from forward  Al Horford  (19 points, 14 rebounds), handed the Grizzlies just their second home loss in their last 22 games at FedExForum.  Zach Randolph  and  Marc Gasol  had 18 points apiece for Memphis.  
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I got off to a slow start. I think I was 1-for-6 at halftime. It was looking like another night where I wasn't going to impact the game. I just went out with a blaze and it worked out in my favor."  
 -- Hawks' Lou Williams on his 13-point third quarter. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Though  Rudy Gay  scored 17 points for Memphis (14-4), he did it on 7-for-25 shooting. Take away his off night, and the Grizzlies, who entered Saturday's game with the NBA's best record, shot 50 percent (26-for-52) from the field. Instead, they finished at 42.9 percent (33-for-77) for the game. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Memphis led 58-53 after a layup by Gasol when Atlanta (12-5), specifically Williams, caught fire. After Williams' layup pulled the Hawks within one (58-57), Smith gave the Hawks a lead they never relinquished with a 3-pointer. Then Williams went back to work, knocking down three straight 3-pointers during a 20-0 Hawks scoring run. Williams' free throws with 37.7 left in the third quarter gave Atlanta its biggest lead of the night at 73-58. 
 
 HOT:  Randolph went 8-for-12 from the floor and registered his league-leading 15th double-double with 18 points and 13 rebounds.  
 
 NOT:  The Hawks'  Devin Harris  scored just three points in 25 minutes while attempting just two field goals. Though Williams went just 6-for-16 from the field overall, he knocked down 4-for-6 3-pointers, including the third-quarter daggers that buried Memphis. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It was a lot of factors tonight. We played tired, we thought tired and we only had 15 assists. We didn't share the basketball. We didn't shoot it well or shoot free throws well. We looked like a team that was tired."  
 -- Memphis coach  Lionel Hollins  on the Grizzlies, who were playing their second game in as many nights.  
 
 
 NOTABLE:  It was the Hawks' third straight win and ninth in their last 10 games. Atlanta still hasn't allowed an opponent to shoot 50 percent from the field in a game this year -- the lone team in the NBA to have that distinction. ... The Hawks came into the game tied for the NBA lead in fast-break points at 17.3 per game. They had 15 to Memphis' five on Saturday. ... Grizzlies point guard  Mike Conley  had three assists. He needs 30 more to pass  Jason Williams  as the franchise's career leader in assists. ... Williams' 13 third-quarter points matched the Grizzlies entire team output in the third as the Hawks outscored the Grizzlies 32-13 in the period. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Hawks, Monday @ Miami, Wednesday @ Orlando, Thursday vs. Charlotte. For the Grizzlies, Wednesday @ Phoenix, Friday @ Denver, Saturday @Utah.
