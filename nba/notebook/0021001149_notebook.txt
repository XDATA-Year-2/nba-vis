  Spurs-Hawks notebook   By Jon Cooper, for NBA.com Posted Tuesday April 5, 2011 11:46PM THE FACTS:  It was better late than never for San Antonio's defense. The Spurs allowed the Atlanta Hawks to shoot over 51 percent for the first three quarters of the game, but clamped down in the fourth to pull out a 97-90 win Tuesday night at Philips Arena. Tony Parker  led the way with a game-high 26 points and  Tim Duncan  added 18 for the Spurs, who used an 11-3 run midway through the fourth quarter to raise their NBA-best record to 59-19. Joe Johnson  led the Hawks with 21 and  Jamal Crawford  chipped in 20 for the Hawks (44-34), who lost for a second straight game following a four-game winning streak. The Hawks still clinched the fifth spot in the East with Boston's victory over Philadelphia. QUOTABLE:  "We changed up a few things each timeout and they responded well and executed it well. I think we probably kept them a little bit off-stride because we changed it up several times. When you do that, you take a chance that somebody might be lost, one of the five, but they stuck together pretty good and the team 'D' worked out well."    --  Gregg Popovich  on San Antonio's fourth-quarter defense THE STAT:  35.3 -- While holding a team to 35.3 percent shooting in a quarter is usually nothing for the Spurs to write home about, on Tuesday night it made the difference. Atlanta had shot 52.3 percent through three quarters, including 58.7 percent in the second (10-for-17), but the relative shutdown, combined with San Antonio hitting at 57.1 percent (8-for-14), allowed the Spurs to outscore the Hawks 31-25 and get the W. TURNING POINT:  Atlanta was on a 7-2 run, and had cut the lead to two, 81-79 with 6:28 left, when Atlanta point guard  Kirk Hinrich  committed a flagrant-1 foul on San Antonio guard  Manu Ginobili . Ginobili hit the two shots and the Spurs proceeded to go on a 6-0 run over the next 2:30, inflating the lead to eight, 87-79, and deflating the crowd at Philips. Atlanta would never pull closer than five the rest of the way. QUOTABLE II:  "I think they picked up the tempo a little bit and it took us out of some things we wanted to run and how we wanted to do it. They're just a great defensive team. They have a lot of guards that just keep attacking you in different ways."   -- Hawks center  Al Horford ,who had 12 points and a game-high nine rebounds HOT:  San Antonio's backcourt was unstoppable in the final 12 minutes. The trio of Ginobili, Parker and  George Hill  combined for 24 points, shooting 6-for-10 and 12-for-12 from the foul line. In the second half the trio was 12-for-21 (57.1 percent), and 14-for-14 from the line. The guard play made up for Duncan only taking two second-half shots and scoring only three points. NOT:  The Hawks' front line starters, already playing without  Josh Smith , who was held out to rest his sore right knee, then losing  Jason Collins  to injury, saw  Marvin Williams  and  Al Horford , combine for four second-half points, while shooting 2-for-9 in the final 24 minutes. Williams was 1-for-3, and Horford was 1-for-6. Seldom-used center  Etan Thomas , playing only his 10th game of the season but second in the last four, matched Williams and Horford in the second half.  FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  George Hill came off the bench and did a little bit of everything. He scored 13 points on 5-for-9 shooting, was 1-for-2 from three, 2-for-2 from the line, had four rebounds, an assist, three steals and even one of San Antonio's two blocked shots. GOOD MOVE:  Putting Hill on  Jamal Crawford . Crawford, who had 18 points on 7-for-10 shooting, 3-for-4 from three, in the first 36 minutes, managed only three shots in the final 12, with his only basket a lay-up with 24.5 seconds remaining and the Spurs up seven. Hill actually outscored Crawford 4-2 in the final stanza. NOTABLE:  Marvin Williams received the sixth annual Jason Collier Memorial Trophy prior to the game. The award honors the memory of the former Hawks center, who passed away on Oct. 15, 2005, and recognizes exemplary service in the community. Williams also won the award for the 2007-08 season. Other winners include  Josh Childress  ('05-06, '06-07), Al Horford ('08-09) and Josh Smith ('09-10). ... Williams scored his 5,000th career point on a layup at 2:36 of the first quarter. ... Hawks center Jason Collins didn't play in the second half after leaving the game with 3:10 left in the first half with a left ankle sprain. ... The Spurs are now 12-5 in the first half of back-to-backs and ended a two-game losing streak in such games. UP NEXT:  For the Hawks, Friday @ Indiana, Saturday @ Washington, Monday vs. Miami. For the Spurs, Wednesday vs. Sacramento, Saturday vs. Utah, Tuesday @ L.A. Lakers.
