 THE FACTS:  After leading by as many as 27 points in front of their home crowd, the Sacramento Kings fell apart in the second half, only to come back and beat the New York Knicks 106-105 on an incredible buzzer-beater by J ames Johnson . 
 
 Marcus Thornton  led the Kings with18 points on 5-for-12 shooting.   DeMarcus Cousins  returned to the starting lineup after missing the previous two games due to suspension.  The Kings big man notched another solid 15-point, 10-rebound double-double, but the hero was Johnson, who finished with 17 points and one huge 3-pointer.  
 
 J.R. Smith  led the way for the Knicks with 28 points, seven rebounds and five assists.   Tyson Chandler  anchored the post with a huge 21-point, 18-rebound performance and  Chris Copeland  gave coach  Mike Woodson  a solid 23 points off the bench on 8-for-16 shooting. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We tease him all the time about his shooting, but for him to have the confidence to shoot it and shoot it the right way and make it, that's big for him.  Hopefully that game-winner can carry over into other games and his shot can really get going." 
 -- DeMarcus Cousins on Johnson's big shot 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Before hitting the game winning 3-pointer against the Knicks, James Johnson had gone 0-for-11 from behind the arc on the season. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The turning point in this game came in the final second as the ball left Johnson's hand and found the bottom of the net for the win.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Scrap what ever my percent is now, I'm 1-for-1 baby!" 
 -- James Johnson  
 
 
 HOT:  Just about every player coach  Keith Smart  sent into the game in the first half lit up the Knicks, but no one more than  Jimmer Fredette .  The reserve guard scored 15 points on 6-for-7 shooting and added four assists in his first 12 minutes of play in the first half.  
 
 NOT:  After shooting 59.5 percent and scoring 71 points in the first half, the Kings shot only 35 percent and got outscored 31-16 in their big third-quarter collapse.  
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Woodson went to J.R. Smith early in the second half and the veteran scorer responded with 15 points after the intermission. He finished with a game-high 28 points on 11-for-25 shooting. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Kings second unit was incredible in the first half, but Smart waited way too long to go back to them in the second half.  The result was almost disastrous as the Kings were outscored 54-35 after intermission.  That would be the story line if Johnson hadn't buried the buzzer-beater.  
 
 NOTABLE:  The Kings had seven players take and make a 3-point shot against the Knicks.  The team finished 15-for-30 from behind the arc, including the game winner.   
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Knicks, Tuesday vs. Portland, Thursday vs. San Antonio, Saturday @ Orlando. For the Kings, Sunday vs. Boston, Tuesday @ Detroit, Wednesday @ Cleveland.
