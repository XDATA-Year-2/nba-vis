 THE FACTS: Klay Thompson  drilled a game-winning 3-pointer with 7.5 seconds left to play, putting the Golden State Warriors ahead 85-83 and sparking them to an 87-83 victory Wednesday night over the Sacramento Kings at Oracle Arena. 
 Thompson scored a game-high 20 points as the Warriors (35-27) beat the Kings (21-42) for the first time this season after falling twice at Sacramento. Golden State strengthened its hold on the No. 6 spot in the Western Conference playoff race, extending its lead over No. 7 Houston and No. 8 Utah, which both lost. The Warriors lead the Rockets by two games and the Jazz by 2 1/2. 
 
 David Lee  added 17 points and 10 rebounds for the Warriors, while  Harrison Barnes  had 14,  Stephen Curry  13 and  Jarrett Jack  12. 
 
 Jason Thompson  led the Kings with 17 points, and  Patrick  Patterson  came off the bench to score 15.  
 Patterson's 3-point shot put the Kings ahead 83-82 with 1:25 left to play, and that was still the score when Kings guard  Toney Douglas  missed a long jump shot and Warriors center  Andrew Bogut  rebounded with under 16 seconds left. 
 After a Warriors timeout, Curry got the ball, but he was double-teamed. So he passed to Lee, who whipped a pass in the right corner to Thompson, who drilled the 3-point shot.  
 The Kings, who were coming off a 120-113 loss Tuesday night at home to Denver, had a chance to force overtime, but  Tyreke Evans  missed a driving bank shot, with Thompson tightly defending. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "It was a great look. D-Lee did a great job of hitting me right in the shooting pocket. I got it off quick. My teammate found me, so it was a pretty easy shot, honestly. I love shooting from the corner. I just did a good job keeping my concentration."

 THE STAT:  The Kings fell to 1-18 against Western Conference teams on the road. They've lost 14 straight on the road against the West. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  With an 83-82 lead and possession of the ball, the Kings had a chance to pad their lead, but Douglas missed a 19-foot jump shot and Bogut rebounded, giving Klay Thompson a chance to play hero. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "At this stage of the season, sure, you'd love to have him on the floor playing well, but sometimes when you're struggling you've got to tip your hat and say, 'You know what, tonight's not my night,' and sometimes that happens. I went with a group that kept us in the game. We are a play away from winning the basketball game. That group got us back in the game. We were down 10 in the first half, that group got us back in there, close to being even at halftime. That group put us up by one, except for an exceptional shot. Klay misses that shot and we rebound, game over, everything is all ice cream and cake."

 HOT:  Lee produced his league-leading 41st  double-double with his 17 points and 10 boards. He went 8-for-14 from the field. The double-double was his season-high eighth straight. 
 
 NOT:  One night after shooting 1-for-12 against Toronto, Cousins was just 2-for-10 and scored five points against the Warriors, logging just 20:19 of playing time. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Warriors starting small forward Harrison Barnes scored in double figures for the third time in his past four games. Barnes scored 14 points and pulled down four rebounds. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Curry's five-game streak of scoring at least 25 points came to an end. He shot just 3-for-11 from the field and finished with 13 points but drilled a big 3-point shot with just under three minutes left, putting the Warriors up 82-78. 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Smart sat Cousins for the entire second quarter -- even when Warrior 7-footer Andrew Bogut was on the floor -- and Sacramento outscored Golden State 23-13 to take a 44-41 halftime lead. Reserve guard Toney Douglas scored seven points during the quarter. Cousins was on the bench again in the fourth when the Kings overcame a 69-63 lead and nearly beat the Warriors. 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Warriors took a 185-184 lead over Sacramento in their series. ... Golden State shot just 36.0 percent from the field and won for the first time since Feb. 24, 2003, at Denver when shooting 36 percent or worse. They shot 35.8 percent and beat the Nuggets 94-89. ... Patterson tied a career high with his three 3-point baskets. He went 3-for-3 from long range. ... The Kings shot just 39.8 percent from the field. ... In his second game back after missing six straight with back spasms, Bogut scored just two points but grabbed eight rebounds and blocked two shots. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Kings, Friday vs. Phoenix, Sunday vs. Milwaukee, Wednesday vs. Chicago. For the Warriors, Friday vs. Houston, Saturday vs. Milwaukee, Monday vs. New York.
