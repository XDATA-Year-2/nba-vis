  Blazers-Cavaliers Notebook   By Rick Noland, for NBA.com Posted Saturday February 5, 2011 10:44PM THE FACTS:  The Cleveland Cavaliers set an NBA single-season record with their 24th straight loss, falling 111-105 to Portland. Vancouver (1995-96) and Denver (1997-98) had shared the record at 23. Cleveland, which has dropped 34 of its last 35 games, also tied its own NBA record of 24 losses over two seasons (last 19 in 1981-82, first five in 1982-83). The Cavs, who have dropped 25 straight on the road, can break that record Monday in Dallas. QUOTABLE:  "Losing gets any player down. If you're a competitor, when you lose, no matter how many times, it's gonna hurt."   - Cavs guard  Daniel Gibson . THE STAT:  Portland made 12-of-19 3-pointers, with  Nicolas Batum  nailing 5-of-6 en route to 21 points. Batum's one miss was blocked.  Wesley Matthews  made 5-of-7 from long range en route to 31 points. TURNING POINT:  The game was tied at 94 when the Trail Blazers went on a 9-0 run, which they later expanded to 11-1 to go up 105-95 at the four-minute mark. Cleveland got back within two at 107-105 on a  Ramon Sessions  drive with 1:23 to go, but  Andre Miller  answered with a bucket at 1:02. When Sessions missed what was basically a layup with 39 seconds left, the game was over, for all intents and purposes. QUOTABLE II:  "It's not a matter of if we're going to win, it's when. We've just got to keep playing that hard."   -  Cavs coach  Byron Scott. WHO'S HOT:  Batum and Matthews, who combined for 52 points on 17-of-25 shooting from the floor, including 10-of-13 from beyond the arc. WHO'S NOT:  Portland's  Dante Cunningham , who got his fifth start of the season but left with 8:24 to go in the second quarter with a cut near his eye. GOOD MOVE:  Blazers point guard Andre Miller had just seven points, but Portland put the ball in his hands with the game on the line and he made two key field goals in the closing moments. BAD MOVE:  Cleveland point guard Ramon Sessions had 15 points, six rebounds and seven assists, but he committed two costly turnovers in the fourth quarter and missed a layup with 39 seconds left and his team down four. NOTABLE:   LaMarcus Aldridge , upset over not making the All-Star team, bounced back from a sub-par performance Friday in Indiana with 20 points, 10 boards and three assists. ... Cleveland's  Jamario Moon  had a season-high 14 points. ... Gibson, who had missed the last three games with a quad injury, had a career-high nine assists. ... The teams combined to go 22-of-42 from beyond the arc. UP NEXT:  For the Trail Blazers, Monday vs. Chicago, Friday at Toronto, Sunday, Feb. 13 at Detroit. For the Cavaliers, Monday at Dallas, Wednesday vs. Detroit, Friday vs. Los Angeles Clippers.
