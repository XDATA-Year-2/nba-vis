 THE FACTS:  The Oklahoma City Thunder built a 19-point lead in the fourth quarter and then had to hold off a late Lakers charge to claim a 114-108 win behind 69 points from  Kevin Durant  and  Russell Westbrook . It's Oklahoma City's seventh straight win and 15th in the last 17 games. 
 Durant led the way with 36 points (one short of his season-high), nine rebounds and four assists. Westbrook added 33 points and eight assists. It's the 21st time in their careers that Durant and Westbrook have gone over 30 points in the same game.  Kobe Bryant  led the Lakers with 35 points and  Dwight Howard  added 23 while pulling down 18 rebounds. 10 of Howard's boards came in the first quarter. 
 Oklahoma City had five players in double figures, in addition to Durant and Westbrook,  Serge Ibaka  scored 14,  Nick Collison  came off the bench to score 13 points and take three charges.  Kevin Martin  added 11. 
 The Lakers had four players hit double digits, Bryant and Howard plus a season-high 17 from  Jodie Meeks  (eight of those in the fourth quarter) and 14 from  Chris Duhon. 
 
 The Lakers dominated the Thunder on the glass, outrebounding them 45-36 and L.A. had a 44-38 advantage in points in the paint but OKC ripped the Lakers on the fast break 28-8. 
 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "That was a solid win, we had some very good stretches but then in the second half we had some not so good stretches. We relaxed some on defense in the second half."  --  Thunder head coach  Scott Brooks. 
 
 
 
 THE STAT:  In the second quarter the Thunder outshot the Lakers 68.2 percent to 36.4 percent and outscored them 41-26 to grab hold of the game. It almost slipped away in the fourth quarter when the Lakers outshot OKC 55.0 percent to 37.5 percent and outscored the Thunder 33-25. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:   "We got a long way to go, we did a terrible job of finishing this game out." --  Durant. 
 
 
 
 TURNING POINT:  That second quarter put the Lakers in a hole they just couldn't dig out of. OKC went on a 17-3 run and scored 32 points over the last eight minutes of the second quarter. 
 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "They're a good team and I thought the first half, really the second quarter, Westbrook got loose a little bit (14 points in 2nd quarter) but we fought back and I thought we played hard. When Westbrook does that, going vertical and stopping on a dime, you kind of just have to tip your hat to him." --  Lakers head coach  Mike D'Antoni . 
 
 
 
 HOT:  The Thunder hit their first three 3-pointers and five of their first six...Howard grabbed 10 rebounds in the first quarter (the most in any quarter this season)...Westbrook was 5-for-6 on 3-pointers in the first half (the five made threes ties his career high)...Durant hit five straight shots in the first half (after missing his first three)...OKC was 8-for-11 (72.7 percent) on 3-pointers in the first half and shot 9-for-17 (52.9 percent) for the game. 
 
 NOT:  Ibaka was 2-for-7 in the first quarter...Bryant was 1-for-5...Lakers shot 37.8 percent in the first half and ended the game at 42.9 percent. 
 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  Metta World Peace  has never been particularly popular with Thunder fans but ever since he cold-cocked (with elbow) former Thunder star  James Harden  last season they've really gotten on him and that was no different tonight. Chesapeake Energy Arena's 79th straight sellout crowd booed World Peace every time he touched the ball. 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Westbrook with a lightning quick move around Howard in the lane late in the first quarter and then finishing with a tomahawk slam. 
 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Lakers packed the paint and Howard disrupted some of the Thunder inside offense daring OKC to shoot from beyond the arc. The strategy backfired in the early going as the Thunder shot a blistering 72.7 percent (8-for-11) on long balls in the first half. 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Westbrook tied his career high for made threes (five) in the first half. His 27 first half points were the most he's scored in any first half of his career...The 67 points by the Thunder in the first half were the most OKC has scored in any first half this season and the most allowed by the Lakers...OKC has now scored 100 or more points in 11 straight games (the longest such streak since 1995)...The Lakers are now 9-11 and it's just the third time since the 1979-80 season L.A. has been below .500 through 20 games...OKC has now beaten the Lakers in eight of their last 10 meetings. 
 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Lakers, Saturday vs. Utah, Tuesday @ Cleveland, Thursday @ New York. For the Thunder, Sunday vs. Indiana, Wednesday vs. New Orleans, Friday vs. Sacramento.
