 THE FACTS:   Brandon Jennings  led the Milwaukee Bucks with 33 points in their 105-96 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers Monday night at the Wells Fargo Center.  Monta Ellis  scored 18 points,  Mike Dunleavy  had 13 and  Tobias Harris  10. The Bucks improved to 3-0 on the road, their best start since winning the first four away games during the 2001-02 season. 
 
 Jrue Holiday  paced the Sixers with 25 points while  Jason Richardson  returned from an ankle injury to contribute 20 points.  Dorell Wright  added 14 points and  Thaddeus Young  11 for Philadelphia, which fell to 4-3. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "Our pick-and-roll defense in the fourth quarter was awesome, the best I've ever seen." 
 -- Jennings 
 
 THE STAT:  The Bucks outscored Philadelphia 42-24 in points in the paint. Entering this game, the Sixers had been allowing the fewest points in the paint in the league. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  After the Sixers got within 94-93, the Bucks responded with a gutsy 9-0 run capped by Dunleavy's 3-pointer for a 103-93 lead with 2:45 left. 
 
 HOT:  Jennings knocked down 12 of his 21 shots and all five of his free throws. Several of his baskets came with the shot clock winding down and defenders draped all over him. 
 
 NOT:   Spencer Hawes  missed eight of his 11 shots for the Sixers. He never seemed comfortable. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "It wasn't heavy legs. It was heavy minds." 
 -- Sixers coach  Doug Collins  on the loss. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Jennings was stellar in every aspect with 33 points, eight assists, five rebounds, four steals and two blocked shots. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  The crowd was rather quiet for much of the game until the Sixers made a late run early in the fourth quarter. When the Bucks quickly countered and pulled away, the fans began filing out with a few minutes remaining. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "We played hard, got some deflections, some steals and were able to pull away in the end." 
 -- Bucks coach  Scott Skiles 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Bucks kept running their offense through Jennings. The ever-improving point guard made some huge plays down the stretch when the Bucks needed a boost from the hard-charging Sixers. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  The Sixers could have attacked the rim a little bit more, even though they fell behind by 16. They were sizzling for a while from beyond the arc, but cooled off. The Sixers were 12-for-16 from the free-throw line. The Sixers are averaging 18 free-throw attempts this season after nearly setting an NBA record last season for the fewest free-throw attempts in a season. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Bucks guard  Doron Lamb  didn't play. The Sixers also chose to rest guard  Maalik Wayns  and forward  Arnett Moultrie . 
 
 NOTABLE:  After missing the last four games with a sprained left ankle, Richardson was inserted back into the 76ers' starting lineup. ... The Bucks shot 63.9 percent (23-for-36) from the field in the first half. ... Milwaukee is 3-0 on the road after going just 14-19 on the road last season. ... The Bucks shot 51.3 percent from the field. Philadelphia has lost 16 straight games when the opposition has shot 50 percent or better, dating to the 2010-11 season. ... Holiday had his third 20-plus point game of the season, but also had eight turnovers -- his fourth consecutive game with at least seven turnovers... Wright knocked down at least four 3-pointers for the second straight game. ... The Bucks outrebounded the Sixers 48-31. 
 
 NEXT:  For the Bucks, Wednesday vs. Indiana, Saturday vs. New Orleans, Monday @ Charlotte. For the Sixers, Wednesday vs. Detroit, Friday vs. Utah, Sunday vs. Cleveland.
