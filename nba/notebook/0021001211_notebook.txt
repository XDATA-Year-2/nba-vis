
 Timberwolves-Suns notebook   By Mike Tulumello, for NBA.com Posted Tuesday April 12, 2011 1:42AM THE FACTS:  They're not going anywhere this season, but the Phoenix Suns and Minnesota Timberwolves put on a show Monday night, with the Suns finally pulling out a 135-127 win in overtime. Channing Frye  hit a 3-pointer to give the Suns a 126-124 lead with 2:06 left in overtime, then  Grant Hill  hit a short jumper and -- after a 24-second violation by the Timberwolves --  Jared Dudley  bombed home a 3-pointer for a decisive 131-124 lead with 47 seconds left. The Suns moved to 39-42. The T-Wolves (17-64) lost their 14th straight game. Frye led the Suns with 33 points. Dudley scored 26. Hill had 21 points and eight assists. For the T-Wolves,  Michael Beasley  scored 26 while  Anthony Tolliver  had 22 points and 10 boards.  Anthony Randolph  had 24 points and 10 rebounds off the bench. A host of players sat out the game, including  Kevin Love, Darko Milicic  and  Sebastian Telfair  for Minnesota and  Vince Carter  for the Suns.  The Suns set a franchise record by playing their ninth overtime game. They are 5-4. QUOTABLE:  "I expect to be back."   --  Steve Nash  on his future with the Suns. He has one year left on his contract. There has been speculation he would request a trade. THE STAT:  The Suns hit 16-for-26 on 3-pointers. TURNING POINT:  The Suns went on an 8-0 run in overtime to seal it. QUOTABLE II:  "Now we have a chance for 40 wins."   --  Suns coach  Alvin Gentry. HOT:  The T-Wolves'  Luke Ridnour  hit 10-for-13 shots for 21 points. NOT:  The Suns'  Aaron Brooks , who may be blowing his chance for a substantial contract in the off-season, hit 2-for-6 for five points, plus five assists and four turnovers. The Suns gave up a first-round draft pick to acquire him from the Houston Rockets even though his contract expires this season. His future with the team is murky. IN THE ARENA:  Broadcaster  Gary Bender , who has worked Suns' games on TV for the past 18 seasons, was the subject of tributes from fellow broadcasters throughout the game. Monday's game was the 700th Suns' game called by Bender. On Wednesday, at home vs. the Spurs, he will wrap up a career that started in 1964. NOTABLE:  Hill played in his 312th game for the Suns since joining them in the 2007-08 season. That means he's played in more than 95 percent of their games. He is set to play in his 80th game Wednesday, in the season-closer vs. the Spurs. That will mark his third straight season of 80-plus games. At 38, he will become the oldest NBA player to do so. UP NEXT:  For the Timberwolves, Wednesday vs. Rockets. For the Suns, Wednesday vs. Spurs.
