 THE FACTS: J.J. Redick  scored 22 points,  Nikola Vucevic  added 17 points and 19 rebounds and backup center  Gustavo Ayon  had the best game of his career as the Orlando Magic broke a 12-game losing streak with a 110-104 victory against the Portland Trail Blazers Sunday. 
 Ayon came off the bench for the Magic (15-36) to match his career high with 16 points, set a career high with six assists, and added 11 rebounds.  Jameer Nelson  had a career-high 15 assists in the Magic's first win since Jan. 16.  LeMarcus Aldridge  scored a game-high 25 points and  Nicolas Batum  had 19 points and eight rebounds for the Blazers (25-26), who never led after the middle of the second quarter. 
 
 QUOTABLE : "It's really just our team defense. If we can stop making so many errors and individual breakdowns, and continue to help each other out defensively and gets stops.  . . . We can stay in game with our offense, but to win games you have to get stops down the stretch and we did." 
 -- Magic guard  Arron Afflalo 
 
 
 THE STAT : The Magic had 34 assists (one short of their season high set at Portland in overtime) on 47 field goals. 
 
 TURNING POINT : In a three-minute sequence in the second quarter, Ayon set up  Andrew Nicholson  for a layup with a behind-the-back pass, blocked a shot, helped contribute for a steal (which was credited to Afflalo) and hit two long jump shots. Portland never led again. 
 
 HOT : Led by Redick, the Magic bench shot 23-for-37 (62 percent). This was six days after the entire team made 23 field goals in a loss at Philadelphia. 
 
 NOT : Portland guard  Damian Lillard , a leading Rookie-of-the-Year candidate, shot 1-for-16, including 0-for-8 from behind the arc. 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "I wouldn't say it was my worst game. It was my worst shooting game, probably. I thought I had a couple of deflections and I know I had a lot of assists [12] so I still impacted the game somewhat. I just didn't make the shots that I normally do." 
 -- Damian Lillard 
 
 GOOD MOVE : The 7-foot Vucevic and 6-foot-10 Ayon played together for 15 1/2 minutes, most of them good minutes for Orlando. 
 
 QUOTABLE III : "We stayed big and luckily we didn't get hit with the 3-point approach, which could happen when you stay big and other teams go small." 
 -- Magic coach  Jacque Vaughn 
 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT : Vucevic had his 30th straight game of nine or more rebounds. His rebound average is now 11.6, compared to 11.7 for NBA-leader  Dwight Howard . 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH : The Magic's Nicholson,  Maurice Harkless  and  Kyle O'Quinn  combined for 25 points and 11 rebounds.  
 
 NOTABLE : The Magic had a 50-38 rebound advantage . . . Both teams shot just over 50 percent . . . The 12-game losing streak was the fifth-longest in Magic history and the longest in nine years. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Blazers: Tuesday @ Miami, Wednesday @ New Orleans, Tuesday (Feb. 19) @ Phoenix. For the Magic: Wednesday vs. Atlanta, Tuesday (Feb. 19) vs. Charlotte, Wednesday (Feb. 20) @ Dallas.
