 THE FACTS : Down 75-69 heading into the fourth quarter, the Nets proceeded to steamroll the league's best-rated defense and suffocate its offense, defeating the Pacers 97-86 Sunday on the strength of a 27-11 fourth quarter advantage.  Deron Williams  registered 22 points and nine assists for the Nets (22-15), dominating at times, while  Joe Johnson  (20 points) and  Brook Lopez  (15 points) stepped up in the second half.  David West  (27 points, six rebounds) led the Pacers (23-15).  
 
 QUOTABLE : "We stopped executing and we lost our composure. We let them get going early and once they got the ball rolling, the game slipped out of our reach."  
 -- David West   
 
 THE STAT : The Pacers shot 3-for-22 in the fourth quarter.   
 
 TURNING POINT : Behind Lopez, Johnson and Williams the Nets reeled off a 17-0 run early in the fourth quarter -- quickly turning an eight-point deficit into a nine-point lead.  
 
 QUOTABLE II : "It's a big test. A lot of our wins lately have come against sub-par .500 teams."  
 -- Deron Williams  
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA : It was "Russian Culture Night" at Barclays. Alexander Markov peformed the national anthem on a violin and the starting lineups were introduced in Russian by Oleg Kolomyets. Nets owner  Mikhail Prokhorov  was not present. ... Actor Jake Gyllenhaal sat courtside.  
 
 ROOKIE WATCH: Orlando Johnson  played nearly 17 minutes for the Pacers, but did not score.  
 
 NOTABLE : West hit his first five shots from the floor. ... Brooklyn native  Lance Stephenson  started for the Pacers, but left the game after only six-plus minutes with a sore right foot. Former Nets player  Gerald Green  (15 points) started for Stephenson in the second half. ... Williams has now hit 32 consecutive free throws. ... The Nets' six-game winning streak is their longest since 2006.   
 
 UP NEXT : For the Pacers, Tuesday @ Charlotte, Wednesday @ Orlando, Friday vs. Houston. For the Nets, Tuesday vs. Toronto, Wednesday @ Atlanta, Friday vs. Atlanta.
