 THE FACT:  Golden State won its 10th straight, one short of the franchise record set in the 1971-72 season.  
 
 THE LEAD: David Lee  scored 22 points and grabbed 18 rebounds to lead the Golden State Warriors to their 10th straight victory, a 101-80 pasting of the Milwaukee Bucks Tuesday night at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. 
 
 Stephen Curry  and  Klay Thompson  added 15 points each as the Warriors (24-13) improved to 6-0 on their long road trip with the finale coming Wednesday at Brooklyn. 
 
 Ersan Ilyasova  led the Bucks (7-27) with 20 points, but Milwaukee dropped its third straight. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I thought the second-half defense especially was special. I can't remember the numbers, but under 30 (actually 32) and shooting a poor percentage, too." 
 -- Warriors coach  Mark Jackson 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Bucks took a 30-28 lead after one quarter but managed just 50 points over the final three quarters, going 17-for-56 (30.4 percent). 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Bucks closed strong in the first half and were within 50-48 at the break. The Warriors then scored the first seven points of the third quarter and extended the run to 27-9 for a 77-57 lead. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "That means a lot. Most importantly, that means our team is playing more consistent basketball. Everyone is stepping up when they need to step up. I'm just excited for this group of guys that we can make this happen." 
 -- David Lee on the chance to be the first NBA team to sweep a road trip of seven games or more 
 
 
 HOT:  Lee made his first nine shots and finished 10-for-12. He was named the Western Conference's Player of the Week on Monday and looks like he's planning on repeating. 
 
 NOT:  Bucks forward  Caron Butler  went just 1-for-7 and has not shot 50 percent in any home game this season. He's shooting just 32.7 percent (34-for-104) at home. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Lee added two assists and a blocked shot to his 22 points and 18 rebounds.  
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  A number of Green Bay Packers were in attendance, including quarterback  Aaron Rodgers . The Packers' season ended on Sunday with a playoff loss to the San Francisco 49ers. Rodgers met with Warriors coach Mark Jackson afterward. "I just appreciate greatness, and there's one of the all-time greats to ever play the game," Jackson said, "so I'm just showing him a little love, and obviously he's showing us a little bit of love for what we're doing." 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Whatever Jackson is saying at halftime is working. The Warriors opened the third quarter with a 27-9 run Tuesday after opening the third quarter with a 30-5 run at Washington on Sunday. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Milwaukee's  Giannis Antetokounmpo  had five rebounds, five assists and two steals but only scored two points on 1-of-3 shooting in 24 ½ minutes. He may need to look to be more of an offensive threat if he's going to continue to start at small forward.  
 
 NOTABLE:  The game was the sixth of a seven-game road trip for the Warriors. They finish the trip Wednesday at Brooklyn. They play Friday at home against Boston and then have four days off before a home game against Denver. ... Bucks forward  Ersan Ilyasova  snapped a streak of 20 straight missed 3-pointers when he made his first attempt of the night. He finished fourth in the league in 3-point percentage last season but was just 8-for-49 entering the game and had made just four of his previous 41. ...  Andre Iguodala  took just three shots -- all 3-pointers -- and made them all. ... The Warriors were shooting 60 percent (30-for-50) before going just 9 for their last 34. ... Golden State has won seven straight road games, matching the franchise record set in 1968-69. ... Milwaukee's  Brandon Knight  had 18 points and is averaging 18.3 points over his last 20 games. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Warriors, Wednesday @ Brooklyn, Friday vs. Boston, Jan. 10 vs. Denver. For the Bucks, Friday vs. Chicago, Saturday @ Oklahoma City, Monday @ Toronto.
