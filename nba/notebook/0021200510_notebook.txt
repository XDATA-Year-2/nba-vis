 THE FACTS:  Portland used a 10-point run in overtime to take a 122-112 lead en route to a 125-119 victory over Orlando on Monday at the Rose Garden.
It was the 10th win in 13 games for the Trail Blazers (19-15), who are an NBA-best 5-0 this season in overtime games.
 Portland had four players with double-doubles --  LaMarcus Aldridge  (27 points, 10 rebounds),  J.J. Hickson  (20 points, 15 boards),  Damian Lillard  (18 points, 10 assists) and  Nicolas Batum  (16 points, 10 assists).
 
 J.J. Redick  came off the bench for a season-high 29 points for Orlando (12-22), which lost its ninth straight game.  Arron Affalo  (24 points),  Jameer Nelson  (21 points, 12 assists),  Nikola Vucevic  (17 points, 13 rebounds) and  Josh McRoberts  (12 points, six rebounds, career-high eight assists) all had big games for the Magic.
 
 QUOTABLE:  "With the recent streak we've been on and our record as of late, we have a confidence and a swagger about us. We're accustomed to winning. We think we're going to win every game. That's the mentality you have to have in this league." 
 -- Portland's  Wesley Matthews , who scored 24 points on 7-for-11 shooting, including 4-for-7 from 3-point range. 
 THE STAT:  Portland shot 51.1 percent from the field and scored a season-high 125 points, including 37 in the third quarter -- the most the Blazers have scored in any quarter this season. 
 TURNING POINT:  With the score tied at 112, Lillard was in the middle of the 10-0 spurt in the extra session. The rookie point guard started it with consecutive baskets, then set up first Hickson, then Matthews for fast-break dunks. When Aldridge scored on a pair of foul shots, it was 122-112 and the Magic were goners.
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We didn't get the win, but we came and put our work in. Our effort was unbelievable. Tough loss, but our guys did some amazing things tonight. They deserved to win that game."  
 --  Jacque Vaughn , Orlando's first-year coach
 
 HOT:  Redick, who came off the bench to bomb in 11 of 17 shots, including 6-for-10 from 3-point range.
 
 NOT:  Nelson, who was 2-for-12 before he began finding the range. He finished 7-for-21 from the field, including 2-for-11 from beyond the arc.
 
 GOOD MOVE:  The Blazers worked the ball inside to Aldridge and Hickson all night, leading to a 60-44 advantage in points in the paint.
 
 BAD MOVE:  Nelson kept bombing away from 3-point range instead of getting the ball to backcourt mates Afflalo and Redick, who were both in dead-eye mode.
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "We won one time, two times, three times in a row. Now, when we get into overtime, that's when we think the game is ours. That's just confidence." 
 -- Portland's Nicolas Batum
 
 NOTABLE:  It was Hickson's 20th double-double and Aldridge's 14th of the season. For Hickson, it was his 10th straight double-double at home. The last time four Blazers recorded double-doubles in a game was April 1998. ... Portland has won eight straight games at the Rose Garden.
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Magic, Wednesday @ Denver, Saturday @ L.A. Clippers, Monday @ Washington. For the Trail Blazers, Thursday vs. Miami, Friday @ Golden State, Sunday vs. Oklahoma City.
