
 Raptors-Bucks notebook   By Rick Braun, for NBA.com Posted Monday April 11, 2011 11:51PM THE FACTS: John Salmons  scored 24 points and  Drew Gooden  added 19 points and 11 rebounds as the Milwaukee Bucks overcame a sloppy first half for a 93-86 victory Monday night at the Bradley Center in their final home game of the season. QUOTABLE:  "I was going to go with a dribble handoff but they kept pressuring up on my guards, so it was kind of tight to do a DHO. I felt like if I could get to my sweet spot on that block to my left and shoot a jump hook, I feel like I can make that shot in my sleep."  --  Gooden on his basket with 1:15 left that stopped a Toronto run and made it 88-84, giving the Bucks all the points they'd end up needing. THE STAT:  Although the Raptors finished with a 50-45 edge on the boards, the Bucks posted a 17-11 advantage in the fourth quarter as they finally overcame the Raptors after a sloppy first half. TURNING POINT:  A 15-0 run took the Bucks from a 77-71 deficit to an 86-77 lead with 3:18 left. From there, the Raptors scored the next seven points to make it 86-84 with 1:33 left. Gooden then got the ball on the right wing and got himself to the right block, where he rose up and dropped in a perfect little jump hook to stop the Raptor rally. Just 28 seconds later Gooden cut down the lane and took a pass from Salmons for a 3-point play that made it 91-84 with 46.8 seconds. QUOTABLE II:  "It's an honor. It speaks to the relationship between me and (Bucks owner)  Sen. (Herb) Kohl  and the organization over the years. You don't see late second-round picks stick with a organization this long."  --  Michael Redd , who most likely played his final home game in an 11-year career with the Bucks HOT:  Salmons hit 9 of 14 shots to make him 23 of 32 over the last two games. NOT:  Toronto's  Joey Dorsey  made just 3 of 12 shots, a great majority of them from in close, but managed to get most of his misses back as he had 10 offensive rebounds and 20 overall. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Former Green Bay Packers running back  Ahman Green  was among the crowd, as was  Fred Roberts , who played forward for the Bucks from 1988-93. GOOD MOVE:  When forward  Reggie Evans  was ruled out before the game with a finger injury, Raptors coach  Jay Triano  started Dorsey in his place. Dorsey became just the seventh Raptor ever to have 20 rebounds in a game. NOTABLE:  The Raptors missed their first six shots, then made 11 of their next 13. ... The Raptors scored 33 points in the first quarter but just 35 in the second half. ... Redd, a second-round pick in the 2000 draft, is the last player from that draft to still be with his original team. ... Point guard  Jerryd Bayless  led the Raptors with 20 points and five assists but also had six of Toronto's 19 turnovers...Toronto forward  James Johnson  played 38 minutes but did not collect a rebound. ... The Bucks had a 22-10 edge in fast-break points ...The Raptors had just eight healthy players dressed for the game...The Bucks swept the Raptors, 4-0, in the season series. UP NEXT:  For the Raptors, Wednesday vs, Miami. For the Bucks, Wednesday @ Oklahoma City.
