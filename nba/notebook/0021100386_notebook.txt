  Notebook: Rockets 96, Suns 89 Posted Thursday February 9, 2012 11:39PM By Mike Tulumello, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  The Phoenix Suns wish the Houston Rockets would keep their reserves on the bench. The surging Rockets (16-11) got tremendous production off the bench in pulling away late from the Suns (11-15) Thursday night in Arizona, 96-89. The Rockets' reserves outscored the Suns bench, 57-13, led by  Patrick Patterson 's 14. Also,  Goran Dragic  killed his old team with 11 points and 11 assists. The Suns played the Rockets more or less even until the two teams went to their benches, then the Rockets took over. "Our bench just played fantastic," Rockets coach  Kevin McHale  said. Channing Frye  had 21 points and 10 boards for the Suns.  Steve Nash , just named to the All-Star Game, had 14 points and 13 assists. QUOTABLE:  "We went small and really did a nice job defensively."    -- Kevin McHale. THE STAT:  The Rockets outrebounded the Suns 55-41. TURNING POINT:  The Rockets, down 85-84, midway through the final quarter, got 3-pointers by  Chase Budinger  and Dragic to take a 90-85 lead. A steal and layup by  Kyle Lowry  to make it 94-89 with 1:40 left wrapped it up. HOT:  Nash hit all seven of his shots. NOT:  The Suns bench shot 5-for-22. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Suns reserves  Ronnie Price  and  Hakim Warrick  have fallen out of the rotation. NOTABLE:  At 38, Nash becomes the fourth player age 38-plus to make the All-Star team, joining  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar ,  Michael Jordan  and  Karl Malone . Nash is averaging 15.1 points and an NBA-best 10.0 assists. He is shooting an astounding .559 from the field, best among NBA guards. He is also shooting 45.5 percent on 3-pointers, the second-highest mark of his career. UP NEXT:  For the Rockets, Sunday @ Golden State, Tuesday @ Memphis and Wednesday vs. Oklahoma City. For the Suns, Saturday @ Sacramento, Monday @ Golden State and Tuesday @ Denver.
