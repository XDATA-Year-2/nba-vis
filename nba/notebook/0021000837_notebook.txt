  Mavericks-Suns notebook   By Jonathan Dalton, for NBA.com Posted Friday February 18, 2011 2:02AM THE FACTS:   Dirk Nowitzki  scored nine of his game-high 35 points in the fourth quarter and the Dallas Mavericks held on to beat the Phoenix Suns 112-106 on Thursday night in the league's final game before the All-Star break. Jason Terry  scored 16,  Tyson Chandler  had 12 points and 12 rebounds and  Shawn Marion  added 12 points for the Mavericks, who won for the 13th time in 14 games and set a franchise record with their 40th win before the All-Star break. Channing Frye  scored 24 points and  Vince Carter  added 16 for the Suns, who have lost two of three but still enters the break with seven wins in 10 games. Phoenix whittled seven-point Mavericks lead to 92-90 on  Robin Lopez 's two free throws with 6:43 remaining. Dallas still led 94-92 with 5:38 to go but Nowitzki made a pair of free throws and added a five-foot jumper, Chandler converted a three-point play and  Jason Kidd  scored on a layup to give the Mavericks a 103-94 lead with 3:14 left. The Suns made one final run, pulling to within 109-106 on Frye's banked 26-foot 3-pointer with 17.3 seconds left but Dallas made 3-for-4 free throws in the final seconds to seal the win. QUOTABLE:  "It's definitely a fun way to go into the break."    -- Dirk Nowitzki. THE STAT:  The Suns outrebounded the Mavericks 43-39 and had a 52-42 advantage in points in the paint. But Phoenix was only 5-for-19 from beyond the arc and everyone not named Frye was a combined 2-for-13. TURNING POINT:  Suns coach  Alvin Gentry  talked about his second unit playing better at the start of the fourth quarter but the damage Thursday was done at the end of the the third. Nash took his usual seat in front of the bench with 2:42 left in the third quarter and the Suns holding a 78-75 lead. The Mavericks scored the quarter's final nine points to complete a 10-2 run and take an 85-80 lead they wouldn't relinquish. QUOTABLE II:  "I think we're going to find a way to make a run and get to the playoffs."  -- Alvin Gentry. HOT:  Lopez had 13 points and 13 rebounds in 24-plus minutes, his longest outing since January 9. NOT:  Suns forward  Grant Hill  was 4-for-14 from the floor including 0-for-4 from beyond the 3-point line. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Nowitzki's 35 points were as many as the 7-footer had in his past two games combined and his best offensive game since scoring a season-high 42 on November 23 against Detroit. Nowitzki had averaged just 14.6 points in his last five games. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Arizona Cardinals free safety  Kerry Rhodes  had courtside seats next to Phoenix owner  Robert Sarver . GOOD MOVE:  Mavericks coach  Rick Carlisle  started  Rodrigue Beaubois  in place of  DeShawn Stevenson  and the first-year player from Guadeloupe responded with nine points in 20 minutes in his second game after missing the season's first 54 with a fractured left foot. BAD MOVE:  Though it's less a conscious move on Gentry's part of his regular rotation of players, switching to the second unit in the closing minutes of the third quarter after the Suns rallied from a 10-point deficit to take a four-point lead backfired badly. He has few second-unit combinations available but the quintet of  Goran Dragic ,  Jared Dudley ,  Marcin Gortat,   Mickael Pietrus  and Frye had no answer for the Mavericks during their decisive 9-0 run. NOTABLE:  Mavericks guard  Jose Barea  was running a fever and did not dress. ... Dallas and San Antonio are the only two Western Conference opponents Phoenix has not beaten this season. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Wednesday vs. Utah, February 26 @ Washington, February 27 @ Toronto . For the Suns, Wednesday vs. Atlanta, February 25 @ Toronto, February 27 @ Indiana.
