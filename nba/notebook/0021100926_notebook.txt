  Notebook: Mavericks 117, Rockets 110 Posted Wednesday April 18, 2012 11:58PM By Dave Ivey, for NBA.com THE FACTS: Dirk Nowitzki  scored 21 of his 35 points in the fourth quarter Wednesday, rallying the Dallas Mavericks to a 117-110 victory against the reeling Houston Rockets at the American Airlines Center. Dallas (35-28) completed a three-game sweep of the season series and handed Houston (32-30) its fifth consecutive loss. Vince Carter  scored a season-high 23 points,  Jason Terry  added 19 and  Jason Kidd  tallied 12 points and eight assists for the defending champions, who can clinch a return to the playoffs with a victory at home Friday against Golden State. Seven players scored in double figures for the Rockets, led by  Goran Dragic  with 20 points and 10 assists,  Luis Scola  with 18 points and  Marcus Camby  with 11 points and a game-high 17 rebounds. QUOTABLE:  "We really needed the win and our guys weren't going to let it go."  --  Mavericks head coach  Rick Carlisle . THE STAT:  All four of Kidd's made baskets were from 3-point range (4-for-7). So far this season, 79 of his 99 field goals have come from behind the arc. TURNING POINT:  Entering the game, Dallas was 3-24 when trailing after three quarters and Houston was 27-4 when it held the lead going into the fourth. This time, however, the Mavericks showed the finishing form that carried them to the title last season. They overwhelmed Houston with 39 points on 65 percent shooting (11-for-17) in the fourth quarter. QUOTABLE II:  "It's tough now. We basically have to win out. We do have to win out. ... Now it's to the point where we are going to need some help. We've got handle our business first, though. ... We have to stay together. We can't start hanging our heads now, because as crazy as it sounds, it's not over yet."  --  Rockets forward  Chandler Parsons. HOT:  Streaky shooting was contagious for Dallas. In addition to Nowitzki's 21-point fourth period, Carter scored the Mavericks' final 10 points of the first quarter, Terry scored 12 of their first 14 in the second quarter and Kidd drained three consecutive 3-pointers to close out the first half. NOT:  After winning four straight games -- all on the road -- from April 2-9, the Rockets have dropped five in a row while allowing an average of 107.6 points per game. Houston is in a dogfight for the final playoff spot in the West with Phoenix and Utah. GOOD MOVE:  Carter capped another vintage "Vinsanity" performance with an emphatic, two-handed putback slam with 5:31 remaining. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Nowitzki scored 31 in the second half, three shy of his own franchise record for a half set against Utah on Nov. 3, 2009. His back-to-back 3-pointers sparked a decisive 20-6 run in the fourth and he finished 10-for-18 from the field and 12-for-12 from the line (11-for-11 in the fourth quarter). It was his eighth 30-point game of the season. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Technical difficulties with the sound system delayed the start of the game for several minutes. There was another audio outage during the second quarter. ROOKIE WATCH:  Parsons scored 12 points on 4-for-13 shooting and added four rebounds and four assists. NOTABLE:  Dallas guard  Delonte West  was fined $25,000 by the NBA for poking Utah forward Gordon Hayward in the ear Monday night. ... Terry drained his 1,784th career 3-pointer at the 11:22 mark of the second quarter, passing  Chauncey Billups  for fourth place on the NBA's all-time list. ... The Mavericks have had at least five players score in double figures in eight straight games. ... Carter needs one 3-pointer to reach 1,500 for his career. ... There were eight ties and 14 lead changes. UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Friday vs. Golden State, Saturday @ Chicago, April 26 @ Atlanta. For the Rockets, Thursday @ New Orleans, Saturday vs. Golden State, Sunday @ Miami.
