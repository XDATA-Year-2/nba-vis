 THE FACTS :  Jeff Teague  turned in his second double-double in as many nights with 19 points and 11 assists, and the Hawks used an 18-0 run to start the second quarter to rout the visiting Clippers 104-93 for Atlanta's fifth straight win. 
 Center  Zaza Pachulia  added a double-double for the Hawks (8-4) with a season-high 19 points and 12 rebounds to send the Clippers (8-5) home with three straight losses, as L.A. wrapped up a four-game road trip.  
 As was the case in L.A.'s 86-76 loss in Brooklyn Friday night, the Clippers struggled on offense. 
 Beyond  Blake Griffin , who had 19 of his 22 points in the first half, and  Chris Paul , who had 19 points, seven assists and seven steals -- the Clippers were just 18-for-46 shots (39.1 percent). 
 Teague had 13 points and 12 assists for Atlanta in a 101-91 win Friday in Charlotte. The Hawks shot 50.7 percent (38-for-75). 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We're playing well. The chemistry is there." 
 --  Jeff Teague 
 
 THE STAT:  +16. The Hawks outscored the Clippers 46-30 in the paint, where L.A. entered the game ranked No. 3 in the NBA in scoring (46.5).  
 
 TURNING POINT:  The Clippers didn't have a starter on the floor when they led 24-21 to begin the second quarter, and they paid for it. 
 The Hawks scored the first 18 points of the period, the first 14 before L.A. coach  Vinny Del Negro  called a timeout with 7:41 left to sub in  DeAndre Jordan , Griffin, Paul and  Caron Butler  for  Ronny Turiaf, Lamar Odom, Eric Bledsoe  and  Matt Barnes . 
 Trailing 35-24 at the time, the Clippers shaved just one point off that margin by halftime to trail 51-41. 
 Atlanta's reserves outscored L.A.'s subs 12-0 in the period (Atlanta starters Teague and Pachulia were on the floor to begin the second quarter), as  Lou Williams  scored nine points and  Anthony Morrow  made a 3-pointer. 
 The Hawks also crushed the Clippers in the third quarter, 34-19, as  Josh Smith  scored 10 of his 17 and made all four of his shots. 
 The Hawks' second-leading scorer, Smith (15.2) sat out the entire second quarter after coming to the bench with two fouls late in the first period and then fussing at coach  Larry Drew . 
 
 QUOTABLE II : "There was an exchange there ... and I wasn't going to play him, at least not in the rest of the half. We talked at halftime."  
 -- Larry Drew, speaking about Josh Smith 
 
 HOT : Griffin seemed to be everywhere in the first quarter, when he had 11 points on 4-for-6 shooting and 3-for-4 on free throws, also with four rebounds and four assists. ... After going 7-for-9, Pachulia made 15-for-22 in the past four games (68.2 percent). ...This is the first time in Teague's career that he had double-doubles in consecutive games.  
 
 NOT:  Hawks center  Al Horford  missed his only free throw. He's gone 1-for-12 in the past three games. ...The Clippers lost the game in the second and third quarters, when they made a combined 12 of their 34 shots (35.3 percent) and Atlanta made 25 of their 42 attempts (59.5 percent) with 17 assists. ... Butler was 1-for-6 in his second game back after missing Wednesday's contest in Oklahoma City with a shoulder strain. In his past four games, he's gone just 6-for-22 shots while scoring 15 total points. He averaged 11 points over L.A.'s first eight games. 
 
 QUOTABLE III : "This trip has taught us not to get too high after wins. We started off well in San Antonio, and down the stretch of these other games we just expected to make plays. You can't just expect to make plays. We have to play better as a group and not just rely on guys like Jamal [Crawford] and Chris [Paul] to bail us out all the time." 
 -- Blake Griffin 
 
 NOTABLE :  Devin Harris  (sprained big left toe) and  DeShawn Stevenson  (sore back, sore knee) did not play for Atlanta. ... Griffin picked up his fourth technical foul of the season early in the fourth quarter while he was on the Clippers' bench. ...  Jamal Crawford  extended his NBA record for four-point plays with 7:43 left in the game when he was fouled by Lou Williams while making a 3-pointer. His ensuing free throw gave him 26 four-point plays in his career. ... Saturday's game was televised in the Republic of Georgia, birthplace of Pachulia. ... Atlanta sub guard Morrow, who scored nine points, had his first turnover of the season. He's played 113 minutes. 
 
 UP NEXT : For the Clippers, Monday vs. Hornets, Wednesday vs. Timberwolves, Saturday vs. Kings. For the Hawks, Wednesday vs. Bobcats, Friday vs. Cavs, Dec. 5 vs. Nuggets.
