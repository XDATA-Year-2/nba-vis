 THE FACT:  It's a less-demanding portion of the schedule -- six of their last seven opponents have losing records -- and the San Antonio Spurs keep rolling up the wins by taking their 11th in a row. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Four players off the San Antonio bench scored in double figures in a 112-93 win over the New Orleans Pelicans.  Manu Ginobili  led the attack by the reserves with 16 points after a 6-for-7 shooting night. The Spurs (13-1) xshot 54 percent. 
 The Pelicans (6-7) lost for the first time since  Ryan Anderson  returned from a broken toe four games back. But Anderson still led the New Orleans offense with 17 points. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "We've been here before, we've done it before, and it's a long season. It's great to be in this situation. It's great to win games like this and great to have a lot of people on the floor."  
 -- Tim Duncan, 10 points, five rebounds and three blocks in less than 25 minutes for San Antonio 
 
 THE STAT:  The Spurs' 54-percent shooting night is their third-straight game at better than 50 percent. In fact, the Spurs have shot 53 percent, 57 percent and tonight's 54 percent in those games. San Antonio entered the game behind only Miami -- the opponent in last season's Finals -- in field-goal percentage. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  The entire second quarter was a disaster for the Pelicans. Trailing by three heading in, New Orleans hit just 7 of their 20 shots and turned the ball over eight times. San Antonio shot 52 percent, outscored New Orleans 30-16 and led by 17 heading into halftime. San Antonio led by as much as 32 after that, and from 2:15 into third quarter through the rest of the game New Orleans couldn't get the lead to less than 20. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "I thought their offense was about as crisp as any offense we've ever seen. We didn't raise our level."  
 -- Pelicans coach  Monty Williams 
 
 
 HOT:  Ginobili's shooting night has him at 60 percent over the last three games (15-for-25). He's 9-for-14 from the 3-point line the last four games. 
 
 NOT:  Jrue Holiday  saw his recent hot-shooting streak come to an end with a 6-for-17 night. He was 26-for-45 (58 percent) in his previous four games, and tonight was his worst shooting results since going 2-for-11 on Nov. 12 at the Lakers. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Holiday had issues with his shot, but he wasn't too far off from a triple-double -- 12 points, nine rebounds and seven assists. 
 
 ROOKIE SPOTLIGHT:   Jeff Withey  played 3 1/2 minutes and had two points and two rebounds. 
 
 NOTABLE:  Spurs center  Tiago Splitter  appeared to injure an ankle with five minutes to go in the first half after hitting 5 of his 6 shots for 11 points and six rebounds; he sat out the rest of the game as a precaution. ... The Spurs have a high-profile game Wednesday when they travel to play Oklahoma City (10-3, winners of five-straight).  ... Duncan has broken out of a shooting slump that saw his field-goal percentage drop to less than 30 percent over a six-game stretch to 8-for-14 over his last two games. ... New Orleans' three-game winning streak that was snapped tonight was the Pelicans' season-best. 
 
 NEXT UP:  For the Pelicans, Tuesday vs. Golden State, Friday @ Philadelphia, Sunday @ New York. For the Spurs, Wednesday @ Oklahoma City, Friday @ Orlando, Saturday vs. Houston.
