  Heat-Sixers notebook   By Shandel Richardson, for NBA.com Posted Saturday November 27, 2010 12:19AM THE FACTS:  The Miami Heat got strong production from its Big Three of guard  Dwyane Wade  (23 points, six rebounds, eight assists) and forwards  LeBron James  (20 points, eight rebounds, six assists) and  Chris Bosh  (18 points, nine rebounds) and put on a fourth-quarter surge to defeat the Philadelphia 76ers 99-90 Friday at AmericanAirlines Arena. This wasn't an easy victory for the Heat, which improved to 7-3 at home. The 76ers trailed 73-71 entering the fourth quarter, but Miami went on a 10-2 run to take an 83-73 lead and secure the victory. Philadelphia got 21 points off the bench from guard  Jodie Meeks , and forward  Andre Iguodala  added 20 points, nine rebounds and five assists. QUOTABLE:  "You never know what will change your momentum in this league."    -- Heat coach  Erik Spoelstra  on the victory. THE STAT:  Meeks was 5-for-8 on 3-pointers en route to 8-for-13 from the field. Meeks' five 3s were one shy of Miami's team total. TURNING POINT:  After starting the fourth quarter with a 73-71 lead, Miami went on a 10-2 run to take an 83-73 lead that iced the game. QUOTABLE II:  "If we had the answers to the test, believe me, we would have used them a long time ago."   -- Chris Bosh HOT:  Heat guard  Carlos Arroyo  is now 13-for-20 (.650) on 3-pointers this season, giving Miami another scoring option when Wade or James draw a double team. NOT:  Philadelphia guard  Jrue Holiday  went 3-for-9 from the field and is now 16-for-45 (.356) from the field in his last four games. FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Iguodala did a little of everything Friday. He had 20 points, nine rebounds, five assists, three steals, and one block. He did this on 8-for-20 shooting from the field, and he did this while defending Wade for much of the night. INSIDE THE ARENA:  Boxer  Floyd Mayweather, Jr.  was booed when he was showed on the big screen. Apparently, people want to see him fight  Manny Pacquaio . ROOKIE WATCH:  Philadelphia's  Evan Turner  had a rough night, going scoreless on 0-for-2 shooting from the field, grabbing no rebounds, and posting two assists. Turner was making his 10th start and played 23 minutes. GOOD MOVE:  Philadelphia coach  Doug Collins  going to his bench. Two players (Meeks and  Thaddeus Young ) scored in double figures and the bench accounted for 44 points on 18-for-32 shooting. BAD MOVE:  Spoelstra going to the bench. OK, he has to go to the bench. But without forward  Udonis Haslem  (foot) and swingman  Mike Miller  (thumb) this is a talent-starved bunch. Miami's bench accounted for just 17 points on 6-for-15 shooting, including 2-for-6 from three-point range. It grabbed just nine rebounds among five players, and didn't provide much energy. UP NEXT:  For Miami at Dallas (Saturday), vs. Washington (Monday), vs. Detroit (Wednesday), at Cleveland (Dec. 2), vs. Atlanta (Saturday). For Philadelphia at New Jersey (Saturday), vs. Portland (Tuesday), at Atlanta (Dec. 3), vs. Charlotte (Dec. 4), vs. Cleveland (Dec. 7).
