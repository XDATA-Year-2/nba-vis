
 Pistons-Grizzlies notebook   By Jason Smith, for NBA.com Posted Wednesday November 24, 2010 11:20PM THE FACTS:   Zach Randolph  scored 21 points and grabbed 14 rebounds to lead the Memphis Grizzlies in a 105-84 home victory over the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday, the Grizzlies' first home win over the Pistons since Dec. 11, 2004. Memphis had dropped five straight regular-season games to the Pistons at FedEx Forum, but outscored Detroit 58-34 Wednesday in the second half to win back-to-back games for just the third time this season. QUOTABLE:  "It worked out pretty well. Different. But, you know, I've just gotta play through it."   --  O.J. Mayo  on being replaced in starting lineup by  Xavier Henry . THE STAT:  As has been the case all season, the Grizzlies dominated the paint offensively, outscoring the Pistons 68-43 inside. Memphis' 68 points in the paint set a new season high, surpassing the 66 it scored in a 116-110 overtime loss to Boston on Nov. 13. Randolph and frontcourt mates  Marc Gasol  and  Darrell Arthur  combined to go 20-for-30 from the floor. TURNING POINT:  Memphis outscored Detroit 20-9 over the final 5:27 of the third quarter after the Pistons cut the Grizzlies' lead to 60-59 midway though the quarter on a  Tayshaun Prince  layup.  Rudy Gay  scored 13 of his 17 points in the quarter after scoring just two points in the first half on 1-for-8 shooting. Randolph added 10 of his 21 in the decisive quarter. HOT:  Arthur was 7-for-9 from the field in a 14-point, six-rebound effort off the bench. NOT:  After going 12-for-18 from the floor in the second quarter and taking a 50-47 lead into halftime, the Pistons went ice cold in the second half, shooting just 30.2 percent (13-for-43). NOTABLE:  Henry made his second straight start in place of Mayo. Memphis coach  Lionel Hollins  said before the game the move was to help improve the Grizzlies' bench scoring. For the second straight contest, the Grizzlies, who had been averaging just 21.6 bench points, set a new season high with 41 points from their reserves against Detroit. ...  Richard Hamilton  was ejected from game with 51.1 seconds left in third after picking up his second technical foul for arguing with an official. QUOTABLE II:  "We got the win and we had 41 points off the bench. I think it played out the way that I hoped it would play out. We have a lot of guys that can play."   -- Hollins on his decision to bring Mayo off the bench and the team's season-high 41 bench points. UP NEXT:  For the Pistons, Friday vs. Milwaukee, Sunday vs. New York, Tuesday at Orlando; For the Grizzlies, Friday vs. Golden State, Saturday at Cleveland, Tuesday vs. Los Angeles Lakers.
