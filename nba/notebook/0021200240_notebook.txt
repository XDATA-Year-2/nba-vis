 THE FACTS:   O.J. Mayo  had a big third quarter,  Elton Brand  had his best game as a Maverick and Dallas overwhelmed the Detroit Pistons in the second half Saturday for a 92-77 victory at the American Airlines Center. Mayo outscored the Pistons 16-11 in the third and finished with a game-high 27 points and Brand tallied 17 points, 12 rebounds and four blocked shots.  Vince Carter  added 12 points on 4-for-6 shooting from behind the arc as the Mavericks (8-9) snapped a three-game losing streak. 
 The Pistons (5-13) were held to 29 points on 27.5 percent shooting in the second half and dropped to 1-10 on the road.  Brandon Knight  led Detroit with 20 points, but only two came after halftime.  Tayshaun Prince  and  Kyle Singler  each scored 12 points and  Jason Maxiell  had 10 points, 12 rebounds and five blocks. Detroit was outscored 50-34 in the paint and 35-13 in fastbreak points. The Pistons committed 13 of their 16 turnovers in the second half. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I had the opportunity to get out there, get some minutes and get in the flow. Once we get back [on defense], we are good. O.J. had the opportunity to hit some open 3s, that gives  Darren  [ Collison]  the opportunity to penetrate and [ Shawn ]  Marion  the ability to hit his floaters. We are off and running after we get stops." 
 -- Mavs' Elton Brand 
 
 THE STAT:  Detroit scored a season-low 11 points in the third quarter and shot 20 percent (4-for-20) from the field. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Mayo scored 16 of the Mavericks' first 17 points in the third quarter as Dallas turned a nine-point deficit into a 59-55 lead. The Mavericks never trailed again. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "We got stops and we got in transition. Detroit was a tired team because they played a hard, physical game last night in Memphis." 
 --Mavericks coach  Rick Carlisle 
 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "We didn't get stops and they started hitting a lot of open jumpers. They became very confident and very tough to defend." 
 --Pistons' Brandon Knight 
 
 HOT:  After going 2-for-10 from 3-point range in the first half, the Mavericks were 6-for-7 during the third quarter. Mayo was 4-for-5 and Carter drained both of his attempts. 
 
 NOT:  Greg Monroe  missed 10 of his first 11 shots and finished with eight points on 4-for-17 shooting. He grabbed a game-high 15 rebounds. 
 
 FANTASY SPOTLIGHT:  Signed on Thursday, veteran point guard  Derek Fisher  started and scored two points in 24 minutes in his Dallas debut. The 38-year-old looked rusty on offense and looked lost at times on defensive rotations, finishing 1-for-8 from the field with three assists and three turnovers. The longtime Laker and five-time NBA champion got his first points as a Maverick without the ball going through the basket, thanks to a goaltending violation by Singler at the 6:53 mark of the first quarter. 
 
 INSIDE THE ARENA:  For the eighth year, the Mavericks hosted the "Seats for Soldiers" event in which season ticket holders donate their courtside seats to wounded soldiers from Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio. Actor  Gary Sinise  greeted the service members as they took their seats. Dallas has a 7-1 record in these games. 
 
 ROOKIE WATCH:  Mavericks forward  Jae Crowder  had a tough shooting night (1-for-8), finishing with four points, four rebounds and three steals. 
 
 NOTABLE:  It was Fisher's first start since March 14, his last game as a Laker before being traded to Oklahoma City. ... Carlisle coached the Pistons for two seasons (2001-02 and 2002-03). ... Dallas plays six of its next seven on the road. ... Detroit has lost five straight in Dallas. ... The Pistons have lost 28 of their last 29 road games against Western Conference opponents. ... The Mavericks' bench outscored the Pistons' reserves 42-15. ... It was the third time this season that Mayo has made six or more 3-pointers and he leads the league with 49 treys.  
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Mavericks, Wednesday @ L.A. Clippers, Thursday @ Phoenix, Saturday @ Houston. For the Pistons, Monday vs. Cleveland, Wednesday vs. Golden State, Friday vs. Chicago.
