 THE FACTS:  The Memphis Grizzlies have found an unexpected source of offense lately. For the second time in three games, defensive specialist  Tony Allen  has scored a season high, this time tossing in 19 points to help lead the Grizzlies to their third straight victory, 108-101, over the Sacramento Kings at FedExForum Tuesday night. Allen also had eight rebounds, three assists, two steals and a blocked shot, as well as a memorable throw-down dunk. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "I think he's been real patient in picking and choosing when to be aggressive and when to try to find his shots. He's been aggressive getting to the rim and doing a good job of offensive rebounding and pushing the break." 
  -- Grizzlies point guard  Mike Conley  on  Allen. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  The Grizzlies entered the game as the NBA's stingiest team, allowing a league-best 90 ppg. A lot of that had to do with their play at home where no opponent this season had scored 100 points until the Kings hit the century mark on a  Tyreke Evans'  layup with 31 seconds left. The Grizzlies began the season holding their first 28 opponents at home under 100 points, the longest streak to start a season by an NBA team in the shot-clock era. 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Sacramento used a 10-2 run midway through the third quarter to pull to within 68-67. But the Grizzlies quickly responded by closing out the period on a 16-6 run to lead 84-73 heading into the final period.  
 
 HOT:  The Grizzlies three-game winning streak has coincided with the rediscovery of their offense. Over the last three games, the team is shooting .506 (118-233) from the floor, far above their season average of .440. 
 
 NOT:  After scoring 10 or more points in nine straight games, which including three with more than 20, Grizzlies' backup guard  Jerryd Bayless  has scored a total of just 13 points in the last two games. Bayless had six points on 2 of 7 shooting against the Kings and is shooting just 36 percent in the last two games. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "Definitely a lot more passing. They share the ball a lot better. They are a tough team to guard because it a threat at every position on the floor now, even in the second unit." Sacramento's  DeMarcus Cousins  on the Grizzlies without  Rudy Gay . 
 
 NOTABLE:  Coupled with Denver's loss to Toronto Tuesday night, the Grizzlies will head into the All-Star break in fourth place in the Western Conference with a 33-18 record. They are a game ahead of the Nuggets, who fell to 33-20. The Nuggets to play at Brooklyn Wednesday, but a win would leave them percentage points behind the Grizzlies. ... Grizzlies center  Marc Gasol  finished with game highs of 24 points and 12 rebounds. He now had four double-doubles in his last six games.  Mike Conley  added 22 points to go with seven assists. ... The Kings were led by center  DeMarcus Cousins , who had 23 points, seven rebounds, five steals and four assists. Evans added 20 points and seven rebounds. ... The Grizzlies improve to 16-0 when scoring 100 or more points. ... The Grizzlies have had assists on over 62.5 percent of their made field goals since trading  Rudy Gay  and gaining  Tayshaun Prince ,  Austin Daye  and  Ed Davis . Prior to the trade, the Grizzlies were ranked 25th in the NBA in assists-to field goals made (.568). 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Kings, Wednesday at Dallas, Feb. 19 vs. San Antonio, Feb. 22 at Atlanta. For the Grizzlies, Feb. 19 at Detroit, Feb. 20 at Toronto, Feb. 22 vs. Orlando.
