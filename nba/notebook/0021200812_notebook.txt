 THE FACTS: Emeka Okafor ,  John Wall  and  Bradley Beal  all finished with double-doubles and the Washington Wizards had a season-high seven players score in double figures as they completed a season-sweep of the Denver Nuggets with a 119-113 win on Friday night. Okafor had 17 points and 13 rebounds, while Beal tallied 17 points and a career-high 12 rebounds for the Wizards (16-37), who snapped a two-game losing streak with their ninth home win in 11 games. 
 
 Ty Lawson  had 27 points and 12 assists for the Nuggets, who trailed 94-78 after three quarters, but rallied back with an 18-4 spurt. Lawson's free throws made it 113-111 with 1:07 remaining. Following a Wall missed jump shot, Nene swatted Lawson's potential game-tying layup. Wall, who finished with 14 points and 10 assists, then made a 19-footer with 13.7 seconds left. 
 
 Trevor Ariza  scored 16 points,  Martell Webster  had 15 and Nene 14 for the Wizards, who entered halftime tied at 64-64 but took the lead for good after opening the third quarter with a 13-0 run. 
 
 Wilson Chandler  had 22 points and  Andre Miller  matched his season-high with 19 points for the Nuggets. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  " That's all we talked about at halftime. We didn't talk anything offensively. We got four straight stops coming out of the third quarter. I thought our intensity picked up from that defensive standpoint and we outscore them 30-14 in that quarter and kind of take control of the game. 
 - Wizards coach  Randy Wittman  on his team's defense during the decisive third-quarter run. 
 
 
 THE STAT:  While the Wizards made 10 of 20 3-pointers through three quarters and 11 overall, the Nuggets missed 18 of 22 attempts from beyond the arc.  
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "On the road we're just not a very good defensive team. Statistically we give up the 3-ball. We don't shoot it very well, but we give up the 3-ball and we give up too many points. We try to outscore people on the road. Defensively at home we're pretty good, but defensively we're ordinary at best on the road." 
 - Nuggets coach  George Karl  after his team surrendered 119 points for the second straight road game. 
 
 
 HOT:   A.J. Price  drained four 3-pointers in the first half and finished with 12 points. The Wizards reserve guard, who Washington will count on for production following the trade of  Jordan Crawford  to the Celtics, shot 3 of 22 from beyond the arc over his previous 11 games. 
 
 NOT:  Lawson and Chandler finished a combined 1 of 10 from on 3-point attempts. Playing in his hometown, Lawson missed all six of his 3-point tries, all coming in the second half. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  " It really wasn't emotional. For some reason I have a selected memory so I remember the stuff I want to remember so it wasn't like I was having flashback or stuff like that, so it wasn't bad. 
 - Nuggets center  JaVale McGee , who scored nine points in his first game in Washington after being traded to Denver midway through last season.  
 
 
 NOTABLE:  The Wizards scored a season-high 64 points in the first half. They also allowed a season-high 64. Washington's 119 is its second-highest scoring game of the season...The Wizards never trailed...Lawson scored 56 points in two games against Washington, including 29 in the 112-1-8 home loss on January 18...All 11 players that entered the game for Washington scored including its five starters. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Nuggets, Saturday at Bobcats, Monday vs. Lakers, Wednesday at Trail Blazers... For the Wizards, Saturday vs. Rockets, Monday at Raptors, Wednesday vs. Pistons.
