  Notebook: Thunder 124, Nuggets 118 Posted Monday February 20, 2012 12:45AM By Randy Renner, for NBA.com THE FACTS:  Three-time All-Star  Kevin Durant  has talked many times about one day scoring 50 points in a basketball game, something he hadn't done yet in his career. The wait is over as Durant dropped 51 on the Denver Nuggets (19-for-28 shooting, 5-for-6 on 3-pointers) to lead the Oklahoma City Thunder to a thrilling 124-118 overtime win. Durant scored 31 of his 51 in the second half. Durant's historic night is just a third of an epic Thunder performance. Point guard  Russell Westbrook  had 40 points while handing out nine assists and forward  Serge Ibaka  compiled a triple-double with 14 points, 15 rebounds and 11 blocks. It marks the first time in NBA history that a trio of teammates combined to score 50 points, 40 points and record a triple-double. Durant and Westbrook scored all 13 of the Thunder points in the overtime. The Nuggets had seven players in double figures led by  Arron Afflalo 's 27.  Andre Miller  added 21 and point guard  Ty Lawson  had 17. The Nuggets dominated inside scoring an amazing 72 paint points. Of their 49 made baskets, 36 came from down low. Denver led by as many as 14 but could not hold off the Thunder in overtime. QUOTABLE:  "That was a heck of a game. Unfortunately someone had to lose. Kevin, Russell and Serge, it was an amazing thing to watch."   -- Thunder coach  Scott Brooks QUOTABLE II:  "The game of basketball can be really mean to you. Tonight we did our job and did very well. I'm proud of my team. To have a great player take a game from you like that is just heart wrenching. It's just the bounce of the ball."   -- Nuggets coach  George Karl QUOTABLE iII:  "That was unbelievable. Probably the best regular-season game I've been a part of or ever seen. 51, 40, triple-double, what else can you say?"   -- Thunder guard  James Harden QUOTABLE IV:  "It feels better to get the win but it is pretty cool (to get 50 points). It's something you dream about as a kid."   -- Durant THE STAT:  Durant and Westbrook combined to hit 35 of the Thunder's 46 made field goals. They were a combined 8-for-12 on 3-pointers and 13-for-15 at the free throw line. In the second half the duo hit 24 of the Thunder's 28 baskets. TURNING POINT:  The game turned several times before taking its final twist. The Nuggets went on a 10-0 run to end the first quarter and take the lead. The Thunder answered with a 20-0 spurt from the end of the second quarter through the first four minutes of the third and Denver started the fourth quarter with a 10-1 run to take a lead. In the overtime Oklahoma City outscored Denver 13-7 to take the game. QUOTABLE V:  "They're one of the best teams in basketball and we took them to overtime. In a lot of ways we won the game. But, the scoreboard says we lost it. Somehow, someway, I've got to get my team to realize that we won a lot of things."   -- Karl HOT:  The Nuggets hit six of their first nine shots (66.7 percent). ... Denver went on to shoot 52.1 percent and score 58 points in the first half. ... Durant was 4-for-5 in the first quarter. He was 12-for-17 and had scored 30 points at the end of three quarters. ...Denver's  Kosta Koufos  was 5-for-6 in the first half. ... In the second half Durant and Westbrook each were 3-for-4 on 3-pointers. NOT:  Westbrook was 4-for-11 in the first half. ... Harden was 2-for-7 in the initial 24 minutes and finished 2-for-12 and 1-for-7 on 3-pointers. GOOD MOVE:  With just four seconds on the shot clock late in the first quarter, Thunder forward  Nick Collison  took the inbounds pass and flipped the ball to Durant. Collison then set a screen on Durant's man and KD fired up a 3-pointer as the shot clock expired. BAD MOVE:  Oklahoma City was slow to get back on defense several times in the first half, including two straight possessions, prompting Brooks to yell, "get back, get back, get back," and then call a timeout after the Nuggets hit consecutive uncontested layups. NOTABLE:  Ibaka's triple-double is the first in Oklahoma City/Seattle franchise history to include blocks as part of the triple-double. ... Durant (51) and Westbrook (40) are the first set of teammates to score 50 and 40 points since  Kiki Vandeweghe  (51) and  Alex English  (47) did it for the Nuggets in 1983. They are the first duo to score 40-plus apiece since  Michael Jordan  (44) and  Scottie Pippen  (40) did it for the Bulls in 1996. ... Ibaka has now blocked at least 10 shots in three games this season. The first time since  Shawn Bradley  had five double-digit block games in the 1996-97 season. ... OKC is now 12-1 at home and has won nine consecutive at Chesapeake Energy Arena. UP NEXT:  For the Nuggets, Monday vs. Minnesota, Wednesday @ L.A. Clippers, Thursday vs. San Antonio. For the Thunder, Monday vs. New Orleans, Wednesday vs. Boston, Thursday vs. L.A. Lakers.
