
 Kings-Suns notebook   By Jonathan Dalton, for NBA.com Posted Saturday November 13, 2010 1:04AM THE FACTS:   Steve Nash  scored a season-high 28 points and added 14 assists to lift the Phoenix Suns to a 103-89 victory over the Sacramento Kings on Friday.  Hakim   Warrick  added 18 points off the bench and  Jason Richardson  had 14 for the Suns, who have won seven straight against the Kings and 13 of the last 14 meetings between the teams.  Carl Landry  scored 20 points and  Tyreke Evans  added 18 for the Kings, who have dropped five straight after a 3-0 start. Phoenix has won 10 straight at home against Sacramento dating back to November 6, 2005. QUOTABLE:  "We were the victim of a Hall of Fame player having a Hall of Fame night,"   -- Kings coach  Paul Westphal  said of Nash THE STAT:  Phoenix shot better than 50 percent for only the second time this season - but also surpassed the 50-percent mark for the second time in three games. Even struggling center  Robin Lopez  got into the act, sinking 4-of-6 field goal attempts to finish with eight points. TURNING POINT:  After the Kings had cut the lead to 77-75 - the closest Sacramento had been since 30-28 early in the second quarter. Nash found  Channing Frye  for an open 3-pointer with 8:14 to go that sparked a 12-4 run and put Phoenix in control. HOT:  Nash hit 13-of-18 from the floor and also had seven rebounds. He's scored in double digits each of the Suns past five games and broke the 20-point mark for the second time in four games. Nash also posted his third straight double-digit assist game on a night when Phoenix had only 19 assists as a team. NOT:  Kings rookie  DeMarcus Cousins  fouled out after 21 minutes with nine points and seven assists. After starting the season and his career with five straight double-digit scoring performance, he's scored 20 points in his last three games combined. NOTABLE:  The Suns are 26-0 in Pacific Division home games against everyone but the Lakers since the start of the 2007-08 season. UP NEXT:  For the Kings, Sunday vs, Detroit, Wednesday vs. New York, Friday vs New Jersey. For the Suns, Sunday @ L.A. Lakers, Monday vs. Denver, Wednesday @ Miami.
