 THE FACT:  It was a tale of two halves. Chicago outrebounded Portland 31-18 in the first half; rebounds were 21-21 in the second half. The Blazers shot .333 (15-for-45) in the first half, .488 (21-for-43) in the second half. 
 
 THE LEAD:  Portland spotted Chicago a 21-point second-quarter lead, trailed 59-44 at halftime, outscored the Bulls 34-12 in the third quarter and pulled out a 98-95 victory Friday night at the Moda Center. 
   It was the ninth straight victory for the Blazers (11-2), their longest streak since a 13-game run in December 2007. 
 
 Wesley Matthews  scored a season-high 28 points and  Robin Lopez  collected 13 points and a career-high 16 rebounds for Portland, which trailed the entire way until late in the third quarter.  Damian Lillard  tallied 14 of his 20 points in the second half. 
   It was a lost night all around for Chicago (6-5).  Derrick Rose , who scored a team-high 20 points, left the game late in the second half after injuring his non-surgically repaired right knee. Rose will undergo an MRI on Saturday. 
 
 Luol Deng  contributed 15 points and a season-high 14 rebounds for the Bulls, who are 0-2 to start a six-game road trip. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "This kind of game is great for us. We needed this game. We've won every kind of way. we've played almost every style of team now, playing Chicago, which is just a bully team. [The Bulls] played hard and they played physical. That's how they get stuff done."  
 -- Wesley Matthews 
 
 
 TURNING POINT:  Chicago led 48-27 midway through the second quarter. Over the next 18 minutes, Portland outscored the Bulls 51-23 to take a 78-71 lead into the final period. 
 
 HOT:  Matthews was 12-for-19 from the field, including 4-for-8 from 3-point range. Matthews is shooting .548 from the field and .500 from 3-point range this season. 
 
 NOT:  The Bulls were 4-for-12 shooting with 10 turnovers in a 12-point third quarter, their lowest-scoring period of the season. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:   "Teams are playing harder than us. When teams make a run, we're all over the place. We're not disciplined. Everybody is frustrated. Everybody is screaming at the refs instead of just focusing on the next task at hand."  
 -- Chicago center  Joakim Noah , who got outrebounded 16-2 by Robin Lopez 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  With Chicago leading 96-95, Matthews leaped high to make a one-hand grab of a pass from Lillard headed out of bounds. Matthews collected himself, then buried a 20-footer to give the Blazers a lead they wouldn't relinquish. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Chicago coach  Tom Thibodeau  had front-line starters  Carlos Boozer  and Noah on the bench during his team's final two possessions, replacing them with  Taj Gibson  and  Nazr Mohammed . Neither Boozer or Noah were having a big game, but the Bulls needed offense at that point. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "In the CBA, that's a '4-3.' "  
 -- Portland coach  Terry Stotts , a former CBA assistant, on the Bulls outscoring the Blazers in three of four quarters. 
 
 
 NOTABLE:  Portland has won five in a row and has prevailed in 10 of its last 12 meetings with Chicago. ... The Blazers had a season-high 11 steals. ... Lopez tied his career high with eight offensive boards. ... Chicago was playing the second of back-to-back games after a 97-87 loss at Denver Thursday night. ... Chicago's  Jimmy Butler  sat out his second straight game with an injured big right toe. ... Portland had six fast-break points, Chicago none. It's the first time the Blazers have not given up a fast-break point since Dec. 9, 2010 against Orlando. 
 
 UP NEXT:  For the Bulls, Sunday at L.A. Clippers, Monday at Utah, Wednesday at Detroit. For the Trail Blazers, Saturday at Golden State, Monday vs. New York, Wednesday at Phoenix.
