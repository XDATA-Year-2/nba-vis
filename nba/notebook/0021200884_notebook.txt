 THE FACTS : After a rough 1-4 road trip, the Sacramento Kings returned home and crushed the Charlotte Bobcats by the final score of 119-83 Sunday. 
 
 John Salmons  scored a game-high 22 points in just 30 minutes of action for the Kings (21-40).  Jason Thompson  cleaned house down low, finishing with 18 points on 6-for-8 shooting and grabbing a game-high 14 rebounds.   Marcus Thornton  led the Kings bench with 18 points on 7-for-11 shooting in the blowout.  Gerald Henderson  and  Byron Mullens  kept the game interesting early and finished with 12 points each, but the Bobcats (13-46) had no answer for the Kings offense tonight.  
 
 THE STAT : Salmons single-handedly matched the Bobcats output in the third quarter, scoring 19 of his 22 points in just 10 minutes of action after the half. 
 
 TURNING POINT : The Kings were able to get some separation right before the intermission, but in the third quarter, they outscored the Bobcats 43-19 and took a 38 lead into the fourth.   
 
 QUOTABLE : "He made open shots and he made tough shots.  He was hot tonight."   
 --  Kemba Walker  on Salmons' big night 
 
 HOT : Salmons caught fire in a big way during the third quarter, scoring 19 points on 5-for-8 shooting and 4-for-7 from long range before taking a seat with two minutes remaining in the period.  
 
 NOT: Ramon Sessions  torched the Kings for 16 points in 29 minutes off the bench last time these two teams met.  This afternoon in Sacramento, he scored just four points on 0-for-5 shooting in 18 minutes. 
 
 GOOD MOVE : The Kings fed the hot-handed Salmons in the third and he didn't let them down.   
 
 BAD MOVE : Salmons came in on a major hot streak, hitting 16 of his previous 22 3-point attempts.  The Bobcats left him open tonight and he continued that trend, finishing 5-for-10 from behind the arc. 
 
 NOTABLE : The Kings' 36-point margin of victory is the teams largest since  November 15, 2005, when they beat the Utah Jazz by the exact same 119-83 score.  
 
 QUOTABLE II : "We're going to continue to see what we need to do, strategically, but we didn't want to just come away second. There's no prize for coming away second.  We've got to figure out a way to keep the team here in Sac."  
 -- Mayor  Kevin Johnson  on his efforts to keep the Kings in Sacramento  
 
 UP NEXT : For the Bobcat, Monday @ Portland, Wednesday vs. Brooklyn, Friday vs. OKC. For the Kings, Tuesday vs. Denver, Wednesday @ Golden State, Friday vs. Suns.
